T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Artificial intelligence has been advancing in fields including anesthesiology. This scoping review of the intersection of artificial intelligence and anesthesia research identified and summarized six themes of applications of artificial intelligence in anesthesiology: (1) depth of anesthesia monitoring, (2) control of anesthesia, (3) event and risk prediction, (4) ultrasound guidance, (5) pain management, and (6) operating room logistics. Based on papers identified in the review, several topics within artificial intelligence were described and summarized: (1) machine learning (including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning), (2) techniques in artificial intelligence (e.g., classical machine learning, neural networks and deep learning, Bayesian methods), and (3) major applied fields in artificial intelligence. The implications of artificial intelligence for the practicing anesthesiologist are discussed as are its limitations and the role of clinicians in further developing artificial intelligence for use in clinical care. Artificial intelligence has the potential to impact the practice of anesthesiology in aspects ranging from perioperative support to critical care delivery to outpatient pain management.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and telemedicine in anesthesia: potential and problems
T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - The application of novel technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and telemedicine in an-esthesiology could play a role in transforming the future of health care. In the present review we discuss the current applications of AI and telemedicine in anesthesiology and perioperative care, exploring their potential influence and the possible hurdles. AI technologies have the potential to deeply impact all phases of perioperative care from accurate risk prediction to operating room organization, leading to increased cost-effective care quality and better outcomes. Telemedi-cine is reported as a successful mean within the anesthetic pathway, including preoperative evaluation, remote patient monitoring, and postoperative care. The utilization of AI and telemedicine is promising encouraging results in periopera-tive management, nevertheless several hurdles remain to be overcome before these tools could be integrated in our daily practice. AI models and telemedicine can significantly influence all phases of perioperative care, helping physicians in the development of precision medicine.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and anesthesia: a narrative review
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objective: The aim of this narrative review is to analyze whether or not artificial intelligence (AI) and its subsets are implemented in current clinical anesthetic practice, and to describe the current state of the research in the field. AI is a general term which refers to all the techniques that enable computers to mimic human intelligence. AI is based on algorithms that gives machines the ability to reason and perform functions such as problem-solving, object and word recognition, inference of world states, and decision-making. It includes machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).Methods: We performed a narrative review of the literature on Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane databases. The research string comprised various combinations of "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "anesthesia", "anesthesiology". The databases were searched independently by two authors. A third reviewer would mediate any disagreement the results of the two screeners.Key Content and Findings: The application of AI has shown excellent results in both anesthesia and in operating room (OR) management. In each phase of the perioperative process, pre-, intra- and postoperative ones, it is able to perform different and specific tasks, using various techniques.Conclusions: Thanks to the use of these new technologies, even anesthesia, as it is happening for other disciplines, is going through a real revolution, called Anesthesia 4.0. however, AI is not free from limitations and open issues. Unfortunately, the models created, provided they have excellent performance, have not yet entered daily practice. Clinical impact analyzes and external validations are needed before this happens. Therefore, qualitative research will be needed to better understand the ethical, cultural, and societal implications of integrating AI into clinical workflows.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in perioperative medicine: a narrative review
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have enabled the development of accurate prediction models using clinical big data. AI models for perioperative risk stratification, intraoperative event prediction, biosignal analyses, and intensive care medicine have been developed in the field of perioperative medicine. Some of these models have been validated using external datasets and randomized controlled trials. Once these models are implemented in electronic health record systems or software medical devices, they could help anesthesiologists improve clinical outcomes by accurately predicting complications and suggesting optimal treatment strategies in real-time. This review provides an overview of the AI techniques used in perioperative medicine and a summary of the studies that have been published using these techniques. Understanding these techniques will aid in their appropriate application in clinical practice.

M3  - Review
AB  - Nanotechnology with artificial intelligence (AI) can metamorphose medicine to an extent that has never been achieved before. AI could be used in anesthesia to develop advanced clinical decision support tools based on machine learning, increasing efficiency, and accuracy. It is also potentially highly troublesome by creating insecurity among clinicians and allowing the transfer of expert domain knowledge to machines. Anesthesia is a complex medical specialty, and assuming AI can easily replace the expert as a clinically sound anesthetist is a very unrealistic expectation. This paper focuses on the association and opportunities for AI developments and deep learning with anesthesia. It reviews the current advances in AI tools and hardware technologies and outlines how these can be used in the field of anesthesia.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in perioperative management of major gastrointestinal surgeries
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrated by machines is based on reinforcement learning and revolves around the usage of algorithms. The purpose of this review was to summarize concepts, the scope, applications, and limitations in major gastrointestinal surgery. This is a narrative review of the available literature on the key capabilities of AI to help anesthesiologists, surgeons, and other physicians to understand and critically evaluate ongoing and new AI applications in perioperative management. AI uses available databases called "big data" to formulate an algorithm. Analysis of other data based on these algorithms can help in early diagnosis, accurate risk assessment, intraoperative management, automated drug delivery, predicting anesthesia and surgical complications and postoperative outcomes and can thus lead to effective perioperative management as well as to reduce the cost of treatment. Perioperative physicians, anesthesiologists, and surgeons are well-positioned to help integrate AI into modern surgical practice. We all need to partner and collaborate with data scientists to collect and analyze data across all phases of perioperative care to provide clinical scenarios and context. Careful implementation and use of AI along with real-time human interpretation will revolutionize perioperative care, and is the way forward in future perioperative management of major surgery.

AB  - PurposeApplication of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is quickly expanding. Despite the amount of evidence and promising results, a thorough overview of the current state of AI in clinical practice of anesthesiology is needed. Therefore, our study aims to systematically review the application of AI in this context.MethodsA systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched Medline and Web of Science for articles published up to November 2022 using terms related with AI and clinical practice of anesthesiology. Articles that involved animals, editorials, reviews and sample size lower than 10 patients were excluded. Characteristics and accuracy measures from each study were extracted.ResultsA total of 46 articles were included in this review. We have grouped them into 4 categories with regard to their clinical applicability: (1) Depth of Anesthesia Monitoring; (2) Image-guided techniques related to Anesthesia; (3) Prediction of events/risks related to Anesthesia; (4) Drug administration control. Each group was analyzed, and the main findings were summarized. Across all fields, the majority of AI methods tested showed superior performance results compared to traditional methods.ConclusionAI systems are being integrated into anesthesiology clinical practice, enhancing medical professionals' skills of decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and therapeutic response.

T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Innovation and new technologies have always impacted significantly the anesthesiology practice all along the perioperative course, as it is recognized as one of the most transformative medical specialties specifically regarding patient's safety. Beside a number of major changes in procedures, equipment, training, and organization that aggregated to establish a strong safety culture with effective practices, anesthesiology is also a stakeholder in disruptive innovation. The present review is not exhaustive and aims to provide an overview on how innovation could change and improve anesthesiology practices through some examples as telemedicine (TM), machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). For example, postoperative complications can be accurately predicted by AI from automated real-time electronic health record data, matching physicians' predictive accuracy. Clinical workflow could be facilitated and accelerated with mobile devices and applications, assuming that these tools should remain at the service of patients and care providers. Care providers and patients connections have improved, thanks to these digital and innovative transformations, without replacing existing relationships between them. It also should give time back to physicians and nurses to better spend it in the perioperative care, and to provide "personalized" medicine keeping a high level of standard of care.

AB  - The term artificial intelligence (AI) was introduced in 1950. There have been many attempts to develop machines capable of performing cognitive and skill based tasks of anesthesiologist based on the principles of AI. These attempts have not been successful because of the complexities of anesthesia practice. Recent innovations in AI, especially machine learning, will continue to grow in importance in the years to come and will greatly revolutionize the face of anesthesia along with surgical practice, perioperative medicine practiced in clinics, and imaging interpretation. Anesthesiologists should continue to embrace this technology, stay up to date with the advances in AI, and also make genuine efforts to smoothly assimilate it in their routine practice now so that they can be the revolutionaries of their own future. We hope to see an ever-widening spectrum of the uses of AI in all fields of medical practice, and anesthesiology is not an exception. Its time our friends start visualizing the many applications of AI in their practice.

M3  - Review
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving and gaining attention in the medical world. Our aim is to provide readers with insights into this quickly changing medical landscape and the role of clinicians in the middle of this popular technology. In this review, our aim is to explain some of the increasingly frequently used AI terminology explicitly for physicians. Next, we give a summation, an overview of currently existing applications, future possibilities for AI in the medical field of anesthesiology and thoroughly highlight possible problems that could arise from implementing this technology in daily practice.Therefore, we conducted a literature search, including all types of articles published between the first of January 2010 and the 1st of May 2023, written in English, and having a free full text available. We searched Pubmed, Medline, and Embase using "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "deep learning", "neural networks" and "anesthesiology" as MESH terms.To structure these findings, we divided the results into five categories: preoperatively, perioperatively, postoperatively, AI in the intensive care unit and finally, AI used for teaching purposes. In the first category, we found AI applications for airway assessment, risk prediction, and logistic support. Secondly, we made a summation of AI applications used during the operation. AI can predict hypotensive events, delivering automated anesthesia, reducing false alarms, and aiding in the analysis of ultrasound anatomy in locoregional anesthesia and echocardiography. Thirdly, namely postoperatively, AI can be applied in predicting acute kidney injury, pulmonary complications, postoperative cognitive dysfunction and can help to diagnose postoperative pain in children.At the intensive care unit, AI tools discriminate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from pulmonary oedema in pleural ultrasound, predict mortality and sepsis more accurately, and predict survival rates in severe Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19). Finally, AI has been described in training residents in spinal ultrasound, simulation, and plexus block anatomy.Several concerns must be addressed regarding the use of AI. Firstly, this software does not explain its decision process (i.e., the 'black box problem'). Secondly, to develop AI models and decision support systems, we need big and accurate datasets, unfortunately with potential unknown bias. Thirdly, we need an ethical and legal framework before implementing this technology. At the end of this paper, we discuss whether this technology will be able to replace the clinician one day. This paper adds value to already existing literature because it not only offers a summation of existing literature on AI applications in anesthesiology but also gives clear definitions of AI itself and critically assesses implementation of this technology.

T2  - UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have shown promising results in healthcare. However, while many advances have been made to incorporate AI into the field of anesthesiology since it was first used to automate anesthetic delivery, it is still not commonplace. Previous studies have demonstrated that ML algorithms are useful in perioperative management, and the contributions of AI to general anesthesia have yielded advancements in closed-loop systems. Although these tools may ultimately help anesthesiologists guide clinical decision making, it is still unknown how ML-based predictions should be managed in real-time. The fields of postoperative pain management and chronic pain have benefited from AI by developing software capable of predicting pain level and analgesia response, allowing for increasingly individualized care. Importantly, data amalgamation and ML techniques may not solely be useful in direct patient care, but will also increase the training power of simulations by providing high fidelity clinical scenarios and unbiased feedback, thereby improving education in anesthesiology. It is clear that AI will find many applications in anesthesia care, in delivering realtime results and patient assessments to enable physicians to focus on higher-order tasks. However, much more work is required to understand exactly the scope that AI will play in anesthesiology.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and anesthesia: A narrative review
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to diagnostic, therapeutic, and intervention-based applications in the field of medicine. Today, there is a deep chasm between AI-based research articles and their translation to clinical anesthesia, which needs to be addressed. Machine learning (ML), the most widely applied arm of AI in medicine, confers the ability to analyze large volumes of data, find associations, and predict outcomes with ongoing learning by the computer. It involves algorithm creation, testing and analyses with the ability to perform cognitive functions including association between variables, pattern recognition, and prediction of outcomes. AI-supported closed loops have been designed for pharmacological maintenance of anesthesia and hemodynamic management. Mechanical robots can perform dexterity and skill-based tasks such as intubation and regional blocks with precision, whereas clinical-decision support systems in crisis situations may augment the role of the clinician. The possibilities are boundless, yet widespread adoption of AI is still far from the ground reality. Patient-related "Big Data" collection, validation, transfer, and testing are under ethical scrutiny. For this narrative review, we conducted a PubMed search in 2020-21 and retrieved articles related to AI and anesthesia. After careful consideration of the content, we prepared the review to highlight the growing importance of AI in anesthesia. Awareness and understanding of the basics of AI are the first steps to be undertaken by clinicians. In this narrative review, we have discussed salient features of ongoing AI research related to anesthesia and perioperative care.

M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial intelligence-driven anesthesiology and perioperative care may just be around the corner. However, its promises of improved safety and patient outcomes can only become a reality if we take the time to examine its technical, ethical, and moral implications. The aim of perioperative medicine is to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. As we introduce new interventions or devices, we must take care to do so with a conscience, keeping patient care as the main objective, and understanding that humanism is a core component of our practice. In our article, we outline key principles of artificial intelligence for the perioperative physician and explore limitations and ethical challenges in the field.

TI  - Application progress of artificial intelligence in pediatric anesthesia
T2  - Journal of Clinical Anesthestology
M3  - Review
AB  - Artificial intelligence technology has been rapidly expanding with increasing relevance in anesthesia.The body evidence to support the use of artificial intelligence in clinical anesthesia,including pediatric anesthesia,is growing.Preoperatively,artificial intelligence was capable of predicting the risk of serious adverse outcomes including mortality and airway-related events,assisting airway diagnosis/assessment,and improving perioperative transfusion prediction.Intraoperatively,artificial intelligence played an attractive role in facilitating ultrasound-based procedures,pediatric airway management and monitoring,and accurate automatic closed-loop anesthesia.Postoperatively,artificial intelligence helped identify the lifethreatening respiratory modes of this vulnerable population.This article introduced the artificial intelligence models utilized in medicine and reviewed the state of the art artificial intelligence applications in pediatric anesthesia throughout each phase of perioperative care.Future artificial intelligence algorithms integrated in every aspect of pediatric anesthesia can supplement anesthesiologists' medical decision-making in perioperative management with improved outcome prediction and overcome unique perioperative risk in pediatric anesthesia.

AB  - There have been many attempts to incorporate automation into the practice of anesthesiology, though none have been successful. Fundamentally, these failures are due to the underlying complexity of anesthesia practice and the inability of rule-based feedback loops to fully master it. Recent innovations in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, may usher in a new era of automation across many industries, including anesthesiology. It would be wise to consider the implications of such potential changes before they have been fully realized.

TI  - Utilizing an artificial intelligence framework (conditional generative adversarial network) to enhance telemedicine strategies for cancer pain management.
T2  - Journal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care (Online)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has significant potential to revolutionize the delivery of medical services, particularly in the field of telemedicine. In this article, we investigate the capabilities of a specific deep learning model, a generative adversarial network (GAN), and explore its potential for enhancing the telemedicine approach to cancer pain management.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We implemented a structured dataset comprising demographic and clinical variables from 226 patients and 489 telemedicine visits for cancer pain management. The deep learning model, specifically a conditional GAN, was employed to generate synthetic samples that closely resemble real individuals in terms of their characteristics. Subsequently, four machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to assess the variables associated with a higher number of remote visits.RESULTS: The generated dataset exhibits a distribution comparable to the reference dataset for all considered variables, including age, number of visits, tumor type, performance status, characteristics of metastasis, opioid dosage, and type of pain. Among the algorithms tested, random forest demonstrated the highest performance in predicting a higher number of remote visits, achieving an accuracy of 0.8 on the test data. The simulations based on ML indicated that individuals who are younger than 45years old, and those experiencing breakthrough cancer pain, may require an increased number of telemedicine-based clinical evaluations.CONCLUSION: As the advancement of healthcare processes relies on scientific evidence, AI techniques such as GANs can play a vital role in bridging knowledge gaps and accelerating the integration of telemedicine into clinical practice. Nonetheless, it is crucial to carefully address the limitations of these approaches.

TI  - Attitudes of Anesthesiologists toward Artificial Intelligence in Anesthesia: A Multicenter, Mixed Qualitative-Quantitative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to play an increasingly important role in perioperative medicine in the very near future. However, little is known about what anesthesiologists know and think about AI in this context. This is important because the successful introduction of new technologies depends on the understanding and cooperation of end users. We sought to investigate how much anesthesiologists know about AI and what they think about the introduction of AI-based technologies into the clinical setting. In order to better understand what anesthesiologists think of AI, we recruited 21 anesthesiologists from 2 university hospitals for face-to-face structured interviews. The interview transcripts were subdivided sentence-by-sentence into discrete statements, and statements were then grouped into key themes. Subsequently, a survey of closed questions based on these themes was sent to 70 anesthesiologists from 3 university hospitals for rating. In the interviews, the base level of knowledge of AI was good at 86 of 90 statements (96%), although awareness of the potential applications of AI in anesthesia was poor at only 7 of 42 statements (17%). Regarding the implementation of AI in anesthesia, statements were split roughly evenly between pros (46 of 105, 44%) and cons (59 of 105, 56%). Interviewees considered that AI could usefully be used in diverse tasks such as risk stratification, the prediction of vital sign changes, or as a treatment guide. The validity of these themes was probed in a follow-up survey of 70 anesthesiologists with a response rate of 70%, which confirmed an overall positive view of AI in this group. Anesthesiologists hold a range of opinions, both positive and negative, regarding the application of AI in their field of work. Survey-based studies do not always uncover the full breadth of nuance of opinion amongst clinicians. Engagement with specific concerns, both technical and ethical, will prove important as this technology moves from research to the clinic.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia: A scoping review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundRegional anesthesia is increasingly used in acute postoperative pain management. Ultrasound has been used to facilitate the performance of the regional block, increase the percentage of successfully performed procedures and reduce the complication rate. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been studied in many medical disciplines with achieving high success, especially in radiology. The purpose of this review was to review the evidence on the application of artificial intelligence for optimization and interpretation of the sonographic image, and visualization of needle advancement and injection of local anesthetic. MethodsTo conduct this scoping review, we followed the PRISMA-S guidelines. We included studies if they met the following criteria: (1) Application of Artificial intelligence-assisted in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia; (2) Any human subject (of any age), object (manikin), or animal; (3) Study design: prospective, retrospective, RCTs; (4) Any method of regional anesthesia (epidural, spinal anesthesia, peripheral nerves); (5) Any anatomical localization of regional anesthesia (any nerve or plexus) (6) Any methods of artificial intelligence; (7) Settings: Any healthcare settings (Medical centers, hospitals, clinics, laboratories. ResultsThe systematic searches identified 78 citations. After the removal of the duplicates, 19 full-text articles were assessed; and 15 studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. ConclusionsAI solutions might be useful in anatomical landmark identification, reducing or even avoiding possible complications. AI-guided solutions can improve the optimization and interpretation of the sonographic image, visualization of needle advancement, and injection of local anesthetic. AI-guided solutions might improve the training process in UGRA. Although significant progress has been made in the application of AI-guided UGRA, randomized control trials are still missing.

AB  - The credibility of threshold-based alarms in anesthesia monitors is low and most of the warnings they produce are not informative. This study aims to show that Machine Learning techniques have a potential to generate meaningful alarms during general anesthesia without putting constraints on the type of procedure. Two distinct approaches were tested - Complication Detection and Anomaly Detection. The former is a generic supervised learning problem and for this a simple feed-forward Neural Network performed best. For the latter, we used an Encoder-Decoder Long Short-Term Memory architecture that does not require a large manually-labeled dataset. We show this approach to be more flexible and in the spirit of Explainable Artificial Intelligence, offering greater potential for future improvement.

Methods: The comprehensive literature about AI in anesthesia was checked in the Web of Science (WOS) core collection. Year of publication, journal metrics including impact factor and quartile, title, document type, topic, and article metric (citations) were extracted. The software tool VOSviewer (version 1.6.17) was implemented for the co-occurrence of keywords and the co-citation analyses, and for evaluating research networks (countries and institutions). Results: Altogether, 288 documents were retrieved from the WOS and 154 articles were included in the analysis. The number of articles increased from 4 articles in 2017 to 37 in 2021. Only 34 were observational investigations and 7 RCTs. The most relevant topic is "anesthesia management". The research network for countries and institutions shows severe gaps. Conclusion: Research on AI in anesthesia is rapidly developing. Further clinical studies are needed. Although different topics are addressed, scientific collaborations must be implemented.

AB  - Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has largely penetrated our daily life. Hence, our expectations regarding clinical AI are very high. However, in healthcare and especially in perioperative medicine, the impact of AI is still relatively limited. This is in contrast with an exponential increase in the academic investment and productivity in this field of data science. Implementation challenges are numerous, including technological and regulatory challenges. In addition, the clinical and economic impact of deploying clinical AI at scale is still lacking. However, if these implementation challenges are properly addressed, the potential of AI to profoundly transform our practice is real. If successfully implemented and integrated into the clinical workflow, AI-assisted perioperative medicine could become more preventative and personalized. However, AI implementation is not the final step. New challenges will follow implementation including algorithm maintenance, continuous monitoring, and improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Artificial intelligence was born to allow computers to learn and control their environment, trying to imitate the human brain structure by simulating its biological evolution. Artificial intelligence makes it possible to analyze large amounts of data (big data) in real-time, providing forecasts that can support the clinician's decisions. This scenario can include diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment in anesthesiology, intensive care medicine, and pain medicine. Machine Learning is a subcategory of AI. It is based on algorithms trained for decisions making that automatically learn and recognize patterns from data. This article aims to offer an overview of the potential application of AI in anesthesiology and analyzes the operating principles of machine learning Every Machine Learning pathway starts from task definition and ends in model application.CONCLUSIONS: High-performance characteristics and strict quality controls are needed during its progress. During this process, different measures can be identified (pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model processing and evaluation). For inexperienced operators, the process can be facilitated by ad hoc tools for data engineering, machine learning, and analytics.

AB  - A noteworthy change in recent medical research is the rapid increase of research using big data obtained from electrical medical records (EMR), order communication systems (OCS), and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS). It is often difficult to apply traditional statistical techniques to research using big data because of the vastness of the data and complexity of the relationships. Therefore, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques which can handle such problems is becoming popular.Classical machine learning techniques, such as k-means clustering, support vector machine, and decision tree are still efficient and useful for some research problems. The deep learning techniques, such as multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, and recurrent neural network have been spotlighted by the success of deep belief networks and convolutional neural networks in solving various problems that are difficult to solve by conventional methods. The results of recent research using artificial intelligence techniques are comparable to human experts. This article introduces technologies that help researchers conduct medical research and understand previous literature in the era of AI.

AB  - In the last 5 years, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have made rapid advances for diagnosis and prognosis in fields ranging from dermatology to anesthesiology. How do we make sense of the rise of AI in healthcare and specifically in spine? How much of what we see today is "hype" and what will remain when the dust settles? In this special issue, several reviews and original articles help us understand the state of AI in healthcare today, the avenues for future progress, and the implications for spine care. Continued engagement, skepticism, and collaboration with technical experts will allow for the development of AI systems that complement and expand our abilities to diagnose, predict, and operate.

T2  - PAIN PHYSICIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Traditional pain assessment methods have significant limitations due to the high variability in patient reported pain scores and perception of pain by different individuals. There is a need for generalized and automatic pain detection and recognition methods. In this paper, stateof-the-art machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods in this field are analyzed as well as pain management techniques.Objective: The objective of the study is to analyze the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML in the analysis and management of pain and to disseminate this knowledge prompting future utilization by medical professionals.Study Design: A narrative review of the literature focusing on the latest algorithms in AI and ML for pain assessment and management.Methods: Research studies were collected using a literature search on PubMed, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore between 2018 and 2020.Results: The results of our assessment resulted in the identification of 47 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Pain assessment was the most studied subject with 11 studies, followed by automated measurements with 10 studies, spinal diagnosis with 8 studies, facial expression with 7 studies, pain assessment in special settings evaluated in 5 studies, 4 studies described treatment algorithms, and 2 studies assessed neonatal pain. These studies varied from simple to highly complex methodology. The majority of the studies suffered from inclusion of a small number of patients and without replication of results. However, considering AI and ML are dynamic and emerging specialties, the results shown here are promising. Consequently, we have described all the available literature in summary formats with commentary. Among the various assessments, facial expression and spinal diagnosis and management appear to be ready for inclusion as we continue to progress.Limitations: This review is not a systematic review of ML and AI applications in pain research. This review only provides a general idea of the upcoming techniques but does not provide an authoritative evidence-based conclusive opinion of their clinical application and effectiveness.Conclusion: While a majority of the studies focused on classification tasks, very few studies have explored the diagnosis and management of pain. Usage of ML techniques as support tools for clinicians holds an immense potential in the field of pain management.

T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
M3  - Review
AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is due to the significant progress in big data, da-tabases, algorithms, and computing power, and medical research is a vital application direction of AI. The inte-grated development of AI and medicine has improved medical technology, and the efficiency of medical servic-es and equipment has enabled doctors to better serve patients. The tasks and characteristics of the anesthesia discipline also make AI necessary for its development, and AI has also been initially applied in different fields of anesthesia. Our review aims to clarify the current situation and challenges of AI application in anesthesiol-ogy to provide clinical references and guide the future development of AI in anesthesiology. This review sum-marizes progress in the application of AI in perioperative risk assessment and prediction, deep monitoring and regulation of anesthesia, essential anesthesia skills operation, automatic drug administration systems, and teaching and training in anesthesia. Also discussed herein are the accompanying risks and challenges of ap-plying AI in anesthesia: patient privacy and information security, data sources, and ethical issues, lack of cap-ital and talent, and the "black box" phenomenon.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cancer Related Pain: A Systematic Review.
T2  - medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Background/objective: Pain is a challenging multifaceted symptom reported by most cancer patients, resulting in a substantial burden on both patients and healthcare systems. This systematic review aims to explore applications of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) in predicting pain-related outcomes and supporting decision-making processes in pain management in cancer.Methods: A comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases was conducted using terms including "Cancer", "Pain", "Pain Management", "Analgesics", "Opioids", "Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning", "Deep Learning", and "Neural Networks" published up to September 7, 2023. The screening process was performed using the Covidence screening tool. Only original studies conducted in human cohorts were included. AI/ML models, their validation and performance and adherence to TRIPOD guidelines were summarized from the final included studies.Results: This systematic review included 44 studies from 2006-2023. Most studies were prospective and uni-institutional. There was an increase in the trend of AI/ML studies in cancer pain in the last 4 years. Nineteen studies used AI/ML for classifying cancer patients' pain development after cancer therapy, with median AUC 0.80 (range 0.76-0.94). Eighteen studies focused on cancer pain research with median AUC 0.86 (range 0.50-0.99), and 7 focused on applying AI/ML for cancer pain management decisions with median AUC 0.71 (range 0.47-0.89). Multiple ML models were investigated with. median AUC across all models in all studies (0.77). Random forest models demonstrated the highest performance (median AUC 0.81), lasso models had the highest median sensitivity (1), while Support Vector Machine had the highest median specificity (0.74). Overall adherence of included studies to TRIPOD guidelines was 70.7%. Lack of external validation (14%) and clinical application (23%) of most included studies was detected. Reporting of model calibration was also missing in the majority of studies (5%).Conclusion: Implementation of various novel AI/ML tools promises significant advances in the classification, risk stratification, and management decisions for cancer pain. These advanced tools will integrate big health-related data for personalized pain management in cancer patients. Further research focusing on model calibration and rigorous external clinical validation in real healthcare settings is imperative for ensuring its practical and reliable application in clinical practice.

AB  - In 2021, progress in clinical science related to Cardiac Anesthesiology continued, but at a slower rate due to the ongoing pandemic and disruptions to clinical research. Most progress was incremental and addressed persistent questions related to our field. To identify articles for this review, we completed a structured review using our previously reported methods (1). Specifically, we used the search terms: "cardiac anesthesiology and outcomes" (n = 177), "cardiothoracic anesthesiology" (n = 34), "cardiac anesthesia," and "clinical outcomes" (n = 42) filtered on clinical trials and the year 2021 in PubMed. We also reviewed clinical trials from the most prominent clinical journals to identify additional studies for a narrative review. We then selected the most noteworthy publications for inclusion in this review and identified key themes.

TI  - Exploring Artificial Intelligence in Anesthesia: A Primer on Ethics, and Clinical Applications
T2  - SURGERIES
M3  - Review
AB  - The field of anesthesia has always been at the forefront of innovation and technology, and the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the next frontier in anesthesia care. The use of AI and its subtypes, such as machine learning, has the potential to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and ameliorate patient outcomes. AI can assist with decision making, but its primary advantage lies in empowering anesthesiologists to adopt a proactive approach to address clinical issues. The potential uses of AI in anesthesia can be schematically grouped into clinical decision support and pharmacologic and mechanical robotic applications. Tele-anesthesia includes strategies of telemedicine, as well as device networking, for improving logistics in the operating room, and augmented reality approaches for training and assistance. Despite the growing scientific interest, further research and validation are needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of these applications in clinical practice. Moreover, the ethical implications of AI in anesthesia must also be considered to ensure that patient safety and privacy are not compromised. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI in anesthesia, including its current and potential applications, and the ethical considerations that must be considered to ensure the safe and effective use of the technology.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence: Innovation to Assist in the Identification of Sono-anatomy for Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anaesthesia.
T2  - Advances in experimental medicine and biology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia (UGRA) involves the targeted deposition of local anaesthesia to inhibit the function of peripheral nerves. Ultrasound allows the visualisation of nerves and the surrounding structures, to guide needle insertion toa perineural or fascial plane end point for injection. However, it is challenging to develop the necessary skills to acquire and interpret optimal ultrasound images. Sound anatomical knowledge is required and human image analysis is fallible, limited by heuristic behaviours and fatigue, while its subjectivity leads to varied interpretation even amongst experts. Therefore, to maximise the potential benefit of ultrasound guidance, innovation in sono-anatomical identification is required.Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly infiltrating many aspects of everyday life. Advances related to medicine have been slower, in part because of the regulatory approval process needing to thoroughly evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of new devices. One area of AI to show significant promise is computer vision (a branch of AI dealing with how computers interpret the visual world), which is particularly relevant to medical image interpretation. AI includes the subfields of machine learning and deep learning, techniques used to interpret or label images. Deep learning systems may hold potential to support ultrasound image interpretation in UGRA but must be trained and validated on data prior to clinical use.Review of the current UGRA literature compares the success and generalisability of deep learning and non-deep learning approaches to image segmentation and explains how computers are able to track structures such as nerves through image frames. We conclude this review with a case study from industry (ScanNav Anatomy Peripheral Nerve Block; Intelligent Ultrasound Limited). This includes a more detailed discussion of the AI approach involved in this system and reviews current evidence of the system performance.The authors discuss how this technology may be best used to assist anaesthetists and what effects this may have on the future of learning and practice of UGRA. Finally, we discuss possible avenues for AI within UGRA and the associated implications.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Small Bowel Endoscopy: Current Perspectives and Future Directions
T2  - JOURNAL OF DIGESTIVE ENDOSCOPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a computer system that is able to perform tasks which normally require human intelligence. The role of AI in the field of gastroenterology has been gradually evolving since its inception in the 1950s. Discovery of wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) and balloon enteroscopy (BE) has revolutionized small gut imaging. While WCE is a relatively patient-friendly and noninvasive mode to examine the nonobstructed small gut, it is limited by a lengthy examination time and the need for expertise in reading images acquired by the capsule. Similarly, BE, despite having the advantage of therapeutic intervention, is costly, invasive, and requires general sedation. Incorporation of concepts like machine learning and deep learning has been used to handle large amounts of data and images in gastroenterology. Interestingly, in small gut imaging, the application of AI has been limited to WCE only. This review was planned to examine and summarize available published data on various AI-based approaches applied to small bowel disease.We conducted an extensive literature search using Google search engine, Google Scholar, and PubMed database for published literature in English on the application of different AI techniques in small bowel endoscopy, and have summarized the outcome and benefits of these applications of AI in small bowel endoscopy. Incorporation of AI in WCE has resulted in significant advancements in the detection of various lesions starting from dysplastic mucosa, inflammatory and nonmalignant lesions to the detection of bleeding with increasing accuracy and has shortened the lengthy review time in image analysis. As most of the studies to evaluate AI are retrospective, the presence of inherent selection bias cannot be excluded. Besides, the interpretability (black-box nature) of AI models remains a cause for concern. Finally, issues related to medical ethics and AI need to be judiciously addressed to enable its seamless use in future.

AB  - Hardly any other development is predicted to have a greater impact on our daily working life than artificial intelligence (AI). A popular field of application of artificial intelligence is the so-called "machine learning", the discipline that deals with the generation of computerised knowledge from experience through self-adaptive algoriths. Especially the high practical relevance, for example, in the field of pattern re-cognition and prediction, makes machine learning a preferred field of application in the medical domain.Especially in intensive care medicine, characterised by an exceptionally high data density and widespread computer-based data acquisition routines, machine learning has recently gained relevant influence in a scientific context as well. The data density of intensive care medicine, resulting from the steadily increasing number of connected devices and data streams, makes the application of AI a preferred field of application in research and development. This opens up new horizons for practice. Thus, after validation, AI-based algorithms in future will not only be able to influence the behaviour of the professions involved, but also directly influence the treatment of patients.This practical guide is intended to provide a "hands-on" introduction to machine learning for use in intensive care medicine, based on practical examples from everyday scientific life. Furthermore, ethical and regulatory aspects of the new technologies are addressed.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Echocardiography for Anesthesiologists
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR ANESTHESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Echocardiography is a unique diagnostic tool for intraoperative monitoring and assessment of patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, there are high levels of interoperator variations in echocardiography interpretations that could lead to inaccurate diagnosis and incorrect treatment. Furthermore, anesthesiologists are faced with the additional challenge to interpret echocardiography and make decisions in a limited time-frame from these complex data. The need for an automated, less operator-dependent process that enhances speed and accuracy of echocardiography analysis is crucial for anesthesiologists. Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in the medical field and could help anesthesiologists analyze complex echocardiographic data while adding increased accuracy and consistency to interpretation. This review aims to summarize practical use of artificial intelligence in echocardiography and discusses potential limitations and challenges in the future for anesthesiologists.

TI  - A Combinatorial Deep Learning Structure for Precise Depth of Anesthesia Estimation From From EEG Signals
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used to measure the depth of anesthesia (DOA) because EEG reflects surgical pain and state of the brain. However, precise and real-time estimation of DOA index for painful surgical operations is challenging due to problems such as postoperative complications and accidental awareness. To tackle these problems, we propose a new combinatorial deep learning structure involving convolutional neural networks (inspired by the inception module), bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention layer. The proposed model uses the EEG signal to continuously predicts the bispectral index (BIS). It is trained over a large dataset, mostly from those under general anesthesia with few cases receiving sedation/analgesia and spinal anesthesia. Despite the imbalance distribution of BIS values in different levels of anesthesia, our proposed structure achieves convincing root mean square error of 5.59 +/- 1.04 and mean absolute error of 4.3 +/- 0.87, as well as improvement in area under the curve of 15% on average, which surpasses state-of-the-art DOA estimation methods. The DOA values are also discretized into four levels of anesthesia and the results demonstrate strong inter-subject classification accuracy of 88.7% that outperforms the conventional methods.

TI  - From Patient-Controlled Analgesia to Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Patient-Controlled Analgesia: Practices and Perspectives
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pain relief is a major concern for patients who have undergone surgery, and it is an eternal pursuit for anesthesiologists. However, postoperative pain management is far from satisfactory, though the past decades have witnessed great progress in the development of novel analgesics and analgesic techniques. A Cochrane systematic review showed that patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) achieved better pain relief and greater patient satisfaction than traditional "on-demand" parenteral analgesia, suggesting that it might be the manner of analgesia implementation that matters for effective postoperative pain management. A wireless intelligent PCA (Wi-PCA) system that incorporated remote monitoring, an intelligent alarm, intelligent analysis and assessment of the PCA equipment, as well as automatically recording and reserving key information functions under a wireless environment was introduced in our department in 2018. The practice showed that the Wi-PCA system significantly reduced the incidence of moderate to severe postoperative pain and relevant adverse effects, shortened hospital stays, and improved patient satisfaction with postoperative pain relief. Nevertheless, for both traditional and Wi-PCA, analgesics are only administered when pain occurs, leaving behind a realm of possibilities for better postoperative pain management. With the rapid development of machinery and deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the mode of clinical decision making. Integrating the big data collected by state-of-the-art monitoring sensors, the Internet of Things and AI algorithms, an AI-assisted PCA (Ai-PCA) may be a promising future direction for postoperative pain management.

TI  - Framing Machine Learning Opportunities for Hypotension Prediction in Perioperative Care: A Socio-technical Perspective
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypotension during perioperative care, if undetected or uncontrolled, can lead to serious clinical complications. Predictive machine learning models, based on routinely collected EHR data, offer potential for early warning of hypotension to enable proactive clinical intervention. However, while research has demonstrated the feasibility of such machine learning models, little effort is made to ground their formulation and development in socio-technical context of perioperative care work. To address this, we present a study of collaborative work practices of clinical teams during and after surgery with specific emphasis on the organisation of hypotension management. The findings highlight where predictive insights could be usefully deployed to reconfigure care and facilitate more proactive management of hypotension. We further explore how the socio-technical insights help define key parameters of machine learning prediction tasks to align with the demands of collaborative clinical practice. We discuss more general implications for the design of predictive machine learning in hospital care.

TI  - Comparative Analysis on Machine Learning and Deep Learning to Predict Post-Induction Hypotension
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypotensive events in the initial stage of anesthesia can cause serious complications in the patients after surgery, which could be fatal. In this study, we intended to predict hypotension after tracheal intubation using machine learning and deep learning techniques after intubation one minute in advance. Meta learning models, such as random forest, extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and deep learning models, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN) model and the deep neural network (DNN), were trained to predict hypotension occurring between tracheal intubation and incision, using data from four minutes to one minute before tracheal intubation. Vital records and electronic health records (EHR) for 282 of 319 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy from October 2018 to July 2019 were collected. Among the 282 patients, 151 developed post-induction hypotension. Our experiments had two scenarios: using raw vital records and feature engineering on vital records. The experiments on raw data showed that CNN had the best accuracy of 72.63%, followed by random forest (70.32%) and Xgboost (64.6%). The experiments on feature engineering showed that random forest combined with feature selection had the best accuracy of 74.89%, while CNN had a lower accuracy of 68.95% than that of the experiment on raw data. Our study is an extension of previous studies to detect hypotension before intubation with a one-minute advance. To improve accuracy, we built a model using state-of-art algorithms. We found that CNN had a good performance, but that random forest had a better performance when combined with feature selection. In addition, we found that the examination period (data period) is also important.

TI  - Postoperative Pain Management in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: Where Are We Heading?
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objectives: Adequate postoperative pain management is crucial in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery because pain can lead to devastating short- and long-term consequences. This review discusses the limitations of current postoperative pain assessment and management in children after cardiac surgery, the obstacles to providing optimal treatment, and concepts to consider that may overcome these barriers. Data Source: MEDLINE and PubMed. Conclusions: Effective pain management in infants and young children undergoing cardiac surgery continues to evolve with innovative methods of both assessment and therapy using newer drugs or novel routes of administration. Artificial intelligence- and machine learning-based pain assessment and patient-tailored management in both pain measurement and prevention are already being integrated into the routine of current practice.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning-aided drug discovery in central nervous system diseases: State-of-the-arts and future directions
T2  - MEDICINAL RESEARCH REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Neurological disorders significantly outnumber diseases in other therapeutic areas. However, developing drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains the most challenging area in drug discovery, accompanied with the long timelines and high attrition rates. With the rapid growth of biomedical data enabled by advanced experimental technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as an indispensable tool to draw meaningful insights and improve decision making in drug discovery. Thanks to the advancements in AI and ML algorithms, now the AI/ML-driven solutions have an unprecedented potential to accelerate the process of CNS drug discovery with better success rate. In this review, we comprehensively summarize AI/ML-powered pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementations in the CNS area. After introducing the AI/ML models as well as the conceptualization and data preparation, we outline the applications of AI/ML technologies to several key procedures in drug discovery, including target identification, compound screening, hit/lead generation and optimization, drug response and synergy prediction, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. We review the current state-of-the-art of AI/ML-guided CNS drug discovery, focusing on blood-brain barrier permeability prediction and implementation into therapeutic discovery for neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss the major challenges and limitations of current approaches and possible future directions that may provide resolutions to these difficulties.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Anesthesiology
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Commercial applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have made remarkable progress recently, particularly in areas such as image recognition, natural speech processing, language translation, textual analysis, and self-learning. Progress had historically languished in these areas, such that these skills had come to seem ineffably bound to intelligence. However, these commercial advances have performed best at single-task applications in which imperfect outputs and occasional frank errors can be tolerated. The practice of anesthesiology is different. It embodies a requirement for high reliability, and a pressured cycle of interpretation, physical action, and response rather than any single cognitive act. This review covers the basics of what is meant by artificial intelligence and machine learning for the practicing anesthesiologist, describing how decision-making behaviors can emerge from simple equations. Relevant clinical questions are introduced to illustrate how machine learning might help solve them-perhaps bringing anesthesiology into an era of machine-assisted discovery.

TI  - A Comprehensive Analysis and Review of Artificial Intelligence in Anaesthesia
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - In the field of anaesthesia, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a game-changing technology. Applications of AI include keeping records, monitoring patients, calculating and administering drugs, and carrying out mechanical procedures. This article explores the current uses, challenges, and prospective applications of AI in anaesthesia practices. This review discusses AI-supported systems like anaesthesia information management systems (AIMS), mechanical robots for carrying out procedures, and pharmacological models for drug delivery. AIMS has helped in automated record-keeping, predicting bad events, and monitoring the vital signs of the patient. Their application has a vital role in improving the efficacy of anaesthesia management and patient safety. The application of AI in anaesthesia comes with its own unique difficulties. Noteworthy obstacles include issues with data quantity and quality, technical limitations, and moral and legal dilemmas. The key to overcoming these barriers is to set guidelines for the ethical use of AI in healthcare, improve the reliability and comprehension of AI systems, and certify the health data precision and security. AI has very bright potential. Exciting future directions include developments in AI and machine learning thus development of new applications, and the possible enhancement in training and education. Potential research areas include the application of AI to chronic disease management, pain management, and the reinforcement of anaesthesiologists' education. AI could be used to design authentic lifelike training simulations and individualized student feedback systems, hence transforming anaesthesia education and training methodology. For this review, we conducted a PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Database search in 2022-2023 and retrieved articles on AI and its uses in anaesthesia. Recommendations for future research and development include strengthening the safety and reliability of health data, building a better understanding of AI systems, and looking into new areas of use. The power of AI can be used to innovate anaesthesia practices by concentrating on these areas.

TI  - Perioperative Handoff Enhancement Opportunities Through Technology and Artificial Intelligence: A Narrative Review
T2  - JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Perioperative handoffs occur as patients progress through preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of care. These may occur between clinicians from the same or different role groups, between different care units, for brief breaks during the course of a surgery, or at shift or service changes. Perioperative handoffs occur during a period of increased vulnerability, as teams must convey critical information at a time of high cognitive load, with many potential distractions.Methods: A search of MEDLINE was conducted for biomedical literature pertaining to perioperative handoffs and technology, electronic tools, and artificial intelligence. The reference lists of identified articles were reviewed, and additional citations were included if relevant. These articles were abstracted to summarize the current literature, and to frame the opportunity for enhanced opportunities to improve perioperative handoffs through technology and artificial intelligence.Results: Several efforts to date have incorporated electronic tools to improve perioperative handoffs but have been limited by imprecision in selecting handoff elements, increased task burden for clinicians, interrupted workflows, physical barriers, and lack of institutional support for their implementation. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being applied across healthcare, but their use in and integration into handoff workflows have not yet been studied. Use of existing technology including mobile applications, barcode scanners, and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags to advance perioperative safety has only begun and similarly has not been applied to handoffs.Conclusion: In this narrative review, we synthesize prior research on electronic tools for perioperative handoffs, limitations of current tools and barriers to their implementation, and the use of AI and ML in perioperative care. We then discuss potential opportunities to further integrate healthcare technologies and apply AI-derived solutions in the concept of a "smart handoff" with the aim of reducing harm from handoffs and improving patient safety.

AB  - In recent years how the engineer plays a vital role in the biomedical field for medical diagnosis is conferred in this article related to Anesthesia drug. The amount of anesthesia given to the patient depends upon the physiological parameters (i.e. electromyography, electrocardiography, electroencephalography) and evaluated by bispectrality index scale, entropy is scrutinized to achieve the goal of anesthesia. It describes the basic terminologies of anesthesia used in a different type of surgery and treatments. It briefly explains the role and classification of anesthesia drugs and their side effect. At last, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) modeling and control of anesthesia are thoroughly reviewed. The use of variables such as electroencephalogram, Bi Spectral Index due to automated monitoring tools controlled by using treatment helps the anesthesiologist. The discussion for practical anesthesiologist are implied with AI classifications with their limitations in clinical care usage. It focuses on a keen overview of the topic based on the research of anesthesia in various types, functions, models, stages, approaches, applications, and performances.

CP  - 3rd International Conference on Imaging, Signal Processing and Communication (ICISPC)

AB  - Results of deep learning methods applied to semantic segmentation of ultrasound images in order to detect brachial plexus nerve sites are presented in this paper. Ultrasound Guided Regional Anesthesia (UGRA) can be used in pain management to reduce the risk of block failure and nerve trauma complications. Many years of experience is required on the part of the anesthesiologist to manually identify a particular nerve structure from an ultrasound image which is often contaminated with speckle noise and motion artifacts. Automating the process of identifying the nerve site using image segmentation would benefit the development of UGRA practices and reduce the risks associated with regional anesthesia treatments. In this paper edge filtering methods and two variations of the convolutional neural network, U-Net and M-Net architectures are used to segment ultrasound images automatically. Modified M-Net with average pooling is observed to produce the best results.

TI  - Pharmacologically informed machine learning approach for identifying pathological states of unconsciousness via resting-state fMRI
T2  - NEUROIMAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the level of consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) remains challenging. To address this challenge, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been widely used for detecting the local, regional, and network activity differences between DOC patients and healthy controls. Although substantial progress has been made towards this endeavor, the identification of robust rs-fMRI-based biomarkers for level of consciousness is still lacking. Recent developments in machine learning show promise as a tool to augment the discrimination between different states of consciousness in clinical practice. Here, we investigated whether machine learning models trained to make a binary distinction between conscious wakefulness and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness would then be capable of reliably identifying pathologically induced unconsciousness. We did so by extracting rs-fMRI-based features associated with local activity, regional homogeneity, and interregional functional activity in 44 subjects during wakefulness, light sedation, and unresponsiveness (deep sedation and general anesthesia), and subsequently using those features to train three distinct candidate machine learning classifiers: support vector machine, Extra Trees, artificial neural network. First, we show that all three classifiers achieve reliable performance within-dataset (via nested cross-validation), with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95, 0.92, and 0.94, respectively. Additionally, we observed comparable cross-dataset performance (making predictions on the DOC data) as the anesthesia-trained classifiers demonstrated a consistent ability to discriminate between unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS/VS) patients and healthy controls with mean AUC's of 0.99, 0.94, 0.98, respectively. Lastly, we explored the potential of applying the aforementioned classifiers towards discriminating intermediate states of consciousness, specifically, subjects under light anesthetic sedation and patients diagnosed as having a minimally conscious state (MCS). Our findings demonstrate that machine learning classifiers trained on rs-fMRI features derived from participants under anesthesia have potential to aid the discrimination between degrees of pathological unconsciousness in clinical patients.

TI  - Comparison of Feature Extraction Methods for Physiological Signals for Heat-Based Pain Recognition
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - While even the most common definition of pain is under debate, pain assessment has remained the same for decades. But the paramount importance of precise pain management for successful healthcare has encouraged initiatives to improve the way pain is assessed. Recent approaches have proposed automatic pain evaluation systems using machine learning models trained with data coming from behavioural or physiological sensors. Although yielding promising results, machine learning studies for sensor-based pain recognition remain scattered and not necessarily easy to compare to each other. In particular, the important process of extracting features is usually optimised towards specific datasets. We thus introduce a comparison of feature extraction methods for pain recognition based on physiological sensors in this paper. In addition, the PainMonit Database (PMDB), a new dataset including both objective and subjective annotations for heat-induced pain in 52 subjects, is introduced. In total, five different approaches including techniques based on feature engineering and feature learning with deep learning are evaluated on the BioVid and PMDB datasets. Our studies highlight the following insights: (1) Simple feature engineering approaches can still compete with deep learning approaches in terms of performance. (2) More complex deep learning architectures do not yield better performance compared to simpler ones. (3) Subjective self-reports by subjects can be used instead of objective temperature-based annotations to build a robust pain recognition system.

M3  - Review
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) already influences almost every sector of our daily life, including the rapidly evolving technologies and datasets of healthcare delivery. The applications in medicine have significantly evolved over the past few decades and have shown promising results. Despite constant efforts to incorporate AI into the field of anesthesiology since its inception, it is still not commonplace. Neuroanesthesiology and neurocritical care is a discipline of medicine that deals with patients having disorders of the nervous system comprising a complex combination of both medical and surgical disease conditions. AI can be used for better monitoring, treatment, and outcome prediction, thereby reducing healthcare costs, minimizing delays in patient management, and avoiding medical errors. In this review, we have discussed the applications of AI and its potential in aiding the clinician's judgment in several aspects of neuroanesthesiology and neurocritical care, some of the barriers to its implementation, and the future trends in improving education in this field, all of which will require further work to understand its exact scope.

TI  - Machine learning methods for perioperative anesthetic management in cardiac surgery patients: a scoping review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Machine learning (ML) is developing fast with promising prospects within medicine and already has several applications in perioperative care. We conducted a scoping review to examine the extent and potential limitations of ML implementation in perioperative anesthetic care, specifically in cardiac surgery patients. Methods: We mapped the current literature by searching three databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and Cochrane Library. Articles were eligible if they reported on perioperative ML use in the field of cardiac surgery with relevance to anesthetic practices. Data on the applicability of ML and comparability to conventional statistical methods were extracted. Results: Forty-six articles on ML relevant to the work of the anesthesiologist in cardiac surgery were identified. Three main categories emerged: (I) event and risk prediction, (II) hemodynamic monitoring, and (III) automation of echocardiography. Prediction models based on ML tend to behave similarly to conventional statistical methods. Using dynamic hemodynamic or ultrasound data in ML models, however, shifts the potential to promising results. Conclusions: ML in cardiac surgery is increasingly used in perioperative anesthetic management. The majority is used for prediction purposes similar to conventional clinical scores. Remarkable ML model performances are achieved when using real-time dynamic parameters. However, beneficial clinical outcomes of ML integration have yet to be determined. Nonetheless, the first steps introducing ML in perioperative anesthetic care for cardiac surgery have been taken.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and "the Art of Kintsugi" in Anesthesiology: ten influential papers for clinical users
T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. In the present review we chose ten influential papers from the last five years and through Kintsugi, shed the light on recent evolution of artificial intelligence in anesthesiology. A comprehensive search in in Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus databases was conducted. Each author searched the databases independently and created a list of six articles that influenced their clinical practice during this period, with a focus on their area of competence. During a subsequent step, each researcher presented his own list and most cited papers were selected to create the final collection of ten articles. In recent years purely methodological works with a cryptic technology (blackbox) represented by the intact and static vessel, translated to a "modern artificial intelligence" in clinical practice and comprehensibility (glass-box). The purposes of this review are to explore the ten most cited papers about artificial intelligence in anesthesiology and to understand how and when it should be integrated in clinical practice. and "the Art of Kintsugi" in Anesthesiology: ten influential papers for clinical users.

TI  - Artificial intelligence for renal cancer: From imaging to histology and beyond
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has made considerable progress within the last decade and is the subject of contemporary literature. This trend is driven by improved computational abilities and increasing amounts of complex data that allow for new approaches in analysis and interpretation. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has a rising incidence since most tumors are now detected at an earlier stage due to improved imaging. This creates considerable challenges as approximately 10%-17% of kidney tumors are designated as benign in histopathological evaluation; however, certain co-morbid populations (the obese and elderly) have an increased peri-interventional risk. AI offers an alternative solution by helping to optimize precision and guidance for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The narrative review introduced basic principles and provide a comprehensive overview of current AI techniques for RCC. Currently, AI applications can be found in any aspect of RCC management including diagnostics, perioperative care, pathology, and follow-up. Most commonly applied models include neural networks, random forest, support vector machines, and regression. However, for implementation in daily practice, health care providers need to develop a basic understanding and establish interdisciplinary collaborations in order to standardize datasets, define meaningful endpoints, and unify interpretation.

AB  - Ultrasound guided nerve blocks are increasingly being used in perioperative care as a means of safely delivering analgesia. Unfortunately, identifying nerves in ultrasound images presents a challenging task for novice anesthesiologists. Drawing from online resources, here we attempted to address this issue by developing a deep learning algorithm capable of automatically identifying the transversus abdominis plane region in ultrasound images. Training of our dataset was done using the U-Net architecture and artificial augmentation was done to optimize our training dataset. The Dice score coefficient was used to evaluate our model, with further evaluation against a test set composed of manually drawn labels from a pool of (n=10) expert anesthesiologists.Across all labelers the model achieved a global Dice score of 73.31% over the entire test set. These preliminary results highlight the potential effectiveness of this model as a future ultrasound decision support system in the field of anesthesia.

TI  - Machine Learning Predicts Patient Tangible Outcomes After Dental Implant Surgery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dental implants have become increasingly important in daily dental offices. The degree of pain and discomfort experienced during a surgical procedure varies from one patient to another. Using advanced machine learning algorithms to predict pain, the dentist and the patient would make more informed decisions about the treatment. This study aims at Predicting postoperative discomfort using an AI-based multi-linear regression model. The functional parametric association between the eight parameters (age, sex, and operating technique) and the patient's postoperative pain was established following implant surgery. The output was normalized information regarding both incidence and severity of immediate discomfort post-implant surgery. To enhance the generalization ability of the multiple linear regression (MLR) model and avoid overfitting, 825 cases were provided as the training set, while 207 cases were given for data authentication. In addition, 45 samples were used as controls to determine the model's prediction accuracy. Evaluation of the given model reveals a Root Mean Squared Error of 0.1085. This prototype predicted AI model postoperative pain following implant surgery with 89.6 % accuracy. Finally, this AI model exhibited clinical viability and utility in predicting postoperative pain after surgery.

TI  - The Ethics of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in Perioperative Medicine: Is Unregulated AI Already at the Bedside?
T2  - CURRENT ANESTHESIOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of ReviewArtificial Intelligence is permeating perioperative medicine and has real implication for patient outcomes. We discuss the ethics of artificial intelligence and big data in perioperative medicine to bring awareness of how the tools can be harnessed to improve patient outcomes, while being cognizant of ethical considerations as AI tools are changing the practice of perioperative healthcare providers across the world.Recent FindingsThere are concerns of scientific integrity with the increasing availability of language learning models and other AI tools that can fabricate data and images. Unregulated AI is likely already at the bedside aiding novices, while healthcare-focused AI tools such as decision support systems undergo regulatory scrutiny.SummaryIn the perioperative setting, training for the healthcare provider will need to catch up with the technological tools available to discern between appropriate uses of the technology.

TI  - Machine Learning Approach to Optimize Sedation Use in Endoscopic Procedures
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH AND INFORMATICS, PROCEEDINGS OF MIE 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 31st Medical Informatics in Europe Conference (MIE)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Endoscopy procedures are often performed with either moderate or deep sedation. While deep sedation is costly, procedures with moderate sedation are not always well tolerated resulting in patient discomfort, and are often aborted. Due to lack of clear guidelines, the decision to utilize moderate sedation or anesthesia for a procedure is made by the providers, leading to high variability in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to build a Machine Learning (ML) model that predicts if a colonoscopy can be successfully completed with moderate sedation based on patients' demographics, comorbidities, and prescribed medications. XGBoost model was trained and tested on 10,025 colonoscopies (70% - 30%) performed at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). XGBoost achieved average area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.762, F1-score to predict procedures that need moderate sedation was 0.85, and precision and recall were 0.81 and 0.89 respectively. The proposed model can be employed as a decision support tool for physicians to bolster their confidence while choosing between moderate sedation and anesthesia for a colonoscopy procedure.

TI  - Detection of difficult airway using deep learning
T2  - MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Whenever a patient needs to enter the operating room, in case the surgery requires general anesthesia, he/she must be intubated, and an anesthesiologist has to make a previous check to the patient in order to evaluate his/her airway. This process should be done to the patient to anticipate any problem, such as a difficult airway at the time of being anesthetized. In fact, the inadequate detection of a difficult airway can cause serious complications, even death. This research work proposes a mobile app that uses a convolutional neural network to detect a difficult airway. This model classifies two classes of the Mallampati score, namely Mallampati 1-2 (with low risk of difficult airway) and Mallampati 3-4 (with higher risk of difficult airway). The average accuracy of the predictive model is 88.5% for classifying pictures. A total of 240 pictures were used for training the model. The results of sensitivity and specificity were 90% in average.

M3  - Review
AB  - Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing anesthesiology research. Unlike classical research methods that are largely inference-based, ML is geared more towards making accurate predictions. ML is a field of artificial intelligence concerned with developing algorithms and models to perform prediction tasks in the absence of explicit instructions. Most ML applications, despite being highly variable in the topics that they deal with, generally follow a common workflow. For classification tasks, a researcher typically tests various ML models and compares the predictive performance with the reference logistic regression model. The main advantage of ML lies in its ability to deal with many features with complex interactions and its specific focus on maximizing predictive performance. However, emphasis on data-driven prediction can sometimes neglect mechanistic understanding. This article mainly focuses on the application of supervised ML to electronic health record (EHR) data. The main limitation of EHR-based studies is in the difficulty of establishing causal relationships. However, the associated low cost and rich information content provide great potential to uncover hitherto unknown correlations. In this review, the basic concepts of ML are introduced along with important terms that any ML researcher should know. Practical tips regarding the choice of software and computing devices are also provided. Towards the end, several examples of successful ML applications in anesthesiology are discussed. The goal of this article is to provide a basic roadmap to novice ML researchers working in the field of anesthesiology.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Anesthesia Recovery Time by Machine Learning Prediction Models
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is significant for anesthesiologists to have a precise grasp of the recovery time of the patient after anesthesia. Accurate prediction of anesthesia recovery time can support anesthesiologist decision-making during surgery to help reduce the risk of surgery in patients. However, effective models are not proposed to solve this problem for anesthesiologists. In this paper, we seek to find effective forecasting methods. First, we collect 1824 patient anesthesia data from the eye center and then performed data preprocessing. We extracted 85 variables to predict recovery time from anesthesia. Second, we extract anesthesia information between variables for prediction using machine learning methods, including Bayesian ridge, lightGBM, random forest, support vector regression, and extreme gradient boosting. We also design simple deep learning models as prediction models, including linear residual neural networks and jumping knowledge linear neural networks. Lastly, we perform a comparative experiment of the above methods on the dataset. The experiment demonstrates that the machine learning method performs better than the deep learning model mentioned above on a small number of samples. We find random forest and XGBoost are more efficient than other methods to extract information between variables on postoperative anesthesia recovery time.

TI  - Future roles of artificial intelligence in early pain management of newborns.
T2  - Paediatric & neonatal pain
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - The advent of increasingly sophisticated medical technology, surgical interventions, and supportive healthcare measures is raising survival probabilities for babies born premature and/or with life-threatening health conditions. In the United States, this trend is associated with greater numbers of neonatal surgeries and higher admission rates into neonatal intensive care units (NICU) for newborns at all birth weights. Following surgery, current pain management in NICU relies primarily on narcotics (opioids) such as morphine and fentanyl (about 100 times more potent than morphine) that lead to a number of complications, including prolonged stays in NICU for opioid withdrawal. In this paper, we review current practices and challenges for pain assessment and treatment in NICU and outline ongoing efforts using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support pain- and opioid-sparing approaches for newborns in the future. A major focus for these next-generation approaches to NICU-based pain management is proactive pain mitigation (avoidance) aimed at preventing harm to neonates from both postsurgical pain and opioid withdrawal. AI-based frameworks can use single or multiple combinations of continuous objective variables, that is, facial and body movements, crying frequencies, and physiological data (vital signs), to make high-confidence predictions about time-to-pain onset following postsurgical sedation. Such predictions would create a therapeutic window prior to pain onset for mitigation with non-narcotic pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions. These emerging AI-based strategies have the potential to minimize or avoid damage to the neonate's body and psyche from postsurgical pain and opioid withdrawal.

AB  - Despite the increasing use of machine learning (ML) in the early diagnosis and determination of risk factors of various infections, studies evaluating the use of ML in central nervous system infections (CNSI) are limited. The Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were searched via Ovid using the keywords "Artificial intelligence" OR "Machine learning" OR "Deep learning" AND "Central nervous system infection" OR "Encephalitis" OR "Meningitis". The last search was performed on July 20, 2022. Studies were selected based on the population, intervention, comparator, outcome(s) of interest, and study design (PICOS). The Joanna Briggs Institute Cohort Studies and Case Control Research Checklist were used to determine the study quality. Studies that included adolescent and adult patients diagnosed with CNSI via cerebrospinal fluid testing or other laboratory examination and imaging methods were reviewed. Five of the 731 identified articles were included. The studies have focused on the role of ML in the following issues: risk factors for developing healthcare-associated ventriculitis/meningitis, assessing treatment failure in patients with spinal epidural abscess (SEA) who were treated non-operatively, prediction of mortality in patients with SEA, differential diagnosis of meningitis, and comparison of differential diagnoses determined using ML methods and that determined by clinicians. Although more studies are needed in this area, ML may soon be used effectively in the diagnosis of CNSI. It is essential to determine the best ML model for each issue. Artificial intelligence applications could potentially contribute to the rapid diagnosis and effective early treatment of diseases.

AB  - Application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical field during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era is being explored further due to its beneficial aspects such as self-reported data analysis, X-ray interpretation, computed tomography (CT) image recognition, and patient management. This narrative review article included published articles from MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar and National Informatics Center egov mobile apps. The database was searched for "Artificial intelligence" and "COVID-19" and "respiratory care unit" written in the English language during a period of one year 2019-2020. The relevance of AI for patients is in hands of people with digital health tools, Aarogya setu app and Smartphone technology. AI shows about 95% accuracy in detecting COVID-19-specific chest findings. Robots with AI are being used for patient assessment and drug delivery to patients to avoid the spread of infection. The pandemic outbreak has replaced the classroom method of teaching with the online execution of teaching practices and simulators. AI algorithms have been used to develop major organ tissue characterization and intelligent pain management techniques for patients. The Blue-dot AI-based algorithm helps in providing early warning signs. The AI model automatically identifies a patient in respiratory distress based on face detection, face recognition, facial action unit detection, expression recognition, posture, extremity movement analysis, visitation frequency detection sound pressure, and light level detection. There is now no looking back as AI and machine learning are to stay in the field of training, teaching, patient care, and research in the future.

TI  - Inference of Brain States Under Anesthesia With Meta Learning Based Deep Learning Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the depth of unconsciousness during anesthesia is beneficial in both clinical settings and neuroscience investigations to understand brain mechanisms. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as an objective means of characterizing brain altered arousal and/or cognition states induced by anesthetics in real-time. Different general anesthetics affect cerebral electrical activities in different ways. However, the performance of conventional machine learning models on EEG data is unsatisfactory due to the low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in the EEG signals, especially in the office-based anesthesia EEG setting. Deep learning models have been used widely in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to perform classification and pattern recognition tasks due to their capability of good generalization and handling noises. Compared to other BCI applications, where deep learning has demonstrated encouraging results, the deep learning approach for classifying different brain consciousness states under anesthesia has been much less investigated. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on meta-learning using deep neural networks, named Anes-MetaNet, to classify brain states under anesthetics. The Anes-MetaNet is composed of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract power spectrum features, and a time consequence model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture the temporal dependencies, and a meta-learning framework to handle large cross-subject variability. We use a multi-stage training paradigm to improve the performance, which is justified by visualizing the high-level feature mapping. Experiments on the office-based anesthesia EEG dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Anes-MetaNet by comparison of existing methods.

TI  - Using artificial intelligence to improve pain assessment and pain management: a scoping review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Context Over 20% of US adults report they experience pain on most days or every day. Uncontrolled pain has led to increased healthcare utilization, hospitalization, emergency visits, and financial burden. Recognizing, assessing, understanding, and treating pain using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches may improve patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. A comprehensive synthesis of the current use and outcomes of AI-based interventions focused on pain assessment and management will guide the development of future research. Objectives This review aims to investigate the state of the research on AI-based interventions designed to improve pain assessment and management for adult patients. We also ascertain the actual outcomes of Al-based interventions for adult patients. Methods The electronic databases searched include Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. The search initially identified 6946 studies. After screening, 30 studies met the inclusion criteria. The Critical Appraisals Skills Programme was used to assess study quality. Results This review provides evidence that machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing were used to improve efficient pain recognition and pain assessment, analyze self-reported pain data, predict pain, and help clinicians and patients to manage chronic pain more effectively. Conclusions Findings from this review suggest that using AI-based interventions has a positive effect on pain recognition, pain prediction, and pain self-management; however, most reports are only pilot studies. More pilot studies with physiological pain measures are required before these approaches are ready for large clinical trial.

TI  - Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Neurocritical Care: a Specialty-Wide Disruptive Transformation or a Strategy for Success
T2  - CURRENT NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review Neurocritical care combines the complexity of both medical and surgical disease states with the inherent limitations of assessing patients with neurologic injury. Artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered interest in the basic management of these complicated patients as data collection becomes increasingly automated. Recent Findings In this opinion article, we highlight the potential AI has in aiding the clinician in several aspects of neurocritical care, particularly in monitoring and managing intracranial pressure, seizures, hemodynamics, and ventilation. The model-based method and data-driven method are currently the two major AI methods for analyzing critical care data. Both are able to analyze the vast quantities of patient data that are accumulated in the neurocritical care unit. AI has the potential to reduce healthcare costs, minimize delays in patient management, and reduce medical errors. However, these systems are an aid to, not a replacement for, the clinician's judgment.

TI  - Analgesia quality index improves the quality of postoperative pain management: a retrospective observational study of 14,747 patients between 2014 and 2021
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe application of artificial intelligence patient-controlled analgesia (AI-PCA) facilitates the remote monitoring of analgesia management, the implementation of mobile ward rounds, and the automatic recording of all types of key data in the clinical setting. However, it cannot quantify the quality of postoperative analgesia management. This study aimed to establish an index (analgesia quality index (AQI)) to re-monitor and re-evaluate the system, equipment, medical staff and degree of patient matching to quantify the quality of postoperative pain management through machine learning.MethodsUtilizing the wireless analgesic pump system database of the Cancer Hospital Affiliated with Nantong University, this retrospective observational study recruited consecutive patients who underwent postoperative analgesia using AI-PCA from June 1, 2014, to August 31, 2021. All patients were grouped according to whether or not the AQI was used to guide the management of postoperative analgesia: The control group did not receive the AQI guidance for postoperative analgesia and the experimental group received the AQI guidance for postoperative analgesia. The primary outcome was the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain (numeric rating scale (NRS) score & GE; 4) and the second outcome was the incidence of total adverse reactions. Furthermore, indicators of AQI were recorded.ResultsA total of 14,747 patients were included in this current study. The incidence of moderate-to-severe pain was 26.3% in the control group and 21.7% in the experimental group. The estimated ratio difference was 4.6% between the two groups (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2% to 6.0%; P < 0.001). There were significant differences between groups. Otherwise, the differences in the incidence of total adverse reactions between the two groups were nonsignificant.ConclusionsCompared to the traditional management of postoperative analgesia, application of the AQI decreased the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain. Clinical application of the AQI contributes to improving the quality of postoperative analgesia management and may provide guidance for optimum pain management in the postoperative setting.

TI  - Deep Learning in Classifying Depth of Anesthesia (DoA)
T2  - INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS, VOL 1
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Intelligent Systems Conference (IntelliSys)
CL  - London, ENGLAND
AB  - This present study is what we think is one of the first studies to apply Deep Learning to learn depth of anesthesia (DoA) levels based solely on the raw EEG signal from a single channel (electrode) originated from many subjects under full anesthesia. The application of Deep Neural Networks to detect levels of Anesthesia from Electroencephalogram (EEG) is relatively new field and has not been addressed extensively in current researches as done with other fields. The peculiarities of the study emerges from not using any type of pre-processing at all which is usually done to the EEG signal in order to filter it or have it in better shape, but rather accept the signal in its raw nature. This could make the study a peculiar, especially with using new development tool that seldom has been used in deep learning which is the DeepLEarning4J (DL4J), the java programming environment platform made easy and tailored for deep neural network learning purposes. Results up to 97% in detecting two levels of Anesthesia have been reported successfully.

TI  - Augmented intelligence in pediatric anesthesia and pediatric critical care
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review Acute care technologies, including novel monitoring devices, big data, increased computing capabilities, machine-learning algorithms and automation, are converging. This enables the application of augmented intelligence for improved outcome predictions, clinical decision-making, and offers unprecedented opportunities to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and improve clinician workflow. This article briefly explores recent work in the areas of automation, artificial intelligence and outcome prediction models in pediatric anesthesia and pediatric critical care. Recent findings Recent years have yielded little published research into pediatric physiological closed loop control (a type of automation) beyond studies focused on glycemic control for type 1 diabetes. However, there has been a greater range of research in augmented decision-making, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques, in particular, for pediatric ICU outcome prediction. Most studies focusing on artificial intelligence demonstrate good performance on prediction or classification, whether they use traditional statistical tools or novel machine-learning approaches. Yet the challenges of implementation, user acceptance, ethics and regulation cannot be underestimated. Areas in which there is easy access to routinely labeled data and robust outcomes, such as those collected through national networks and quality improvement programs, are likely to be at the forefront of the adoption of these advances.

TI  - Technology optimization for patient safety: a blockchain-based anesthesia record system architecture
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BLOCKCHAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Patient safety is acknowledged as a primary aim of anesthesiology. Anesthesia records constitute the main document of the intraoperative course of anesthesia administration. In this paper, we postulate that anesthesia record systems should be based on an integral tamper-proof design and provide specific technology characteristics to ensure data immutability, accessibility and transparency. Issues and limitations regarding current anesthesia record technologies are reviewed. We introduce a novel anesthesia record system designed for patient safety optimization which integrates dedicated hardware, blockchain technology and decentralized storage solutions. We propose an oracle network in which anesthesiologists run independent Sybil-resistant nodes which broadcast biosensor time series to decentralized storage systems and generate proofs of existence on public blockchains. Records are biometrically signed and incorporate information on the temporo-spatial relation between the anesthetized patient and the professional in charge through a unique personal-transponder wearable device. Compatibility for data science and machine learning implementation are discussed. Finally, we evaluate future impact and technological potential.

T2  - MEDICAL IMAGING 2023
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Processing
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Gastric motility disorders are caused by abnormal muscle contractions which may impede the digestive process. Traditional approaches for evaluating human gastric motility have limitations, including discomfort, use of sedation, risk of radiation exposure, and confusion in interpretation. Magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCCE) provides a new way to evaluate human gastric with the advantages of comfort, safety, and no anesthesia. In this paper, we develop deep learning algorithms to detect human gastric waves captured by MCCE. We demonstrate promising experimental results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our methods have great potential to assist in the diagnosis of human gastric disease by evaluating gastric motility.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study conducted a comprehensive patent and bibliometric analysis to elucidate the evolving scientific landscape surrounding the development and application of pulse oximeters, including in the field of digital medicine. Utilizing data from the Lens database for the period of 2000-2023, we identified the United States, China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom as the predominant countries in patent issuance for pulse oximeter technology. Our bibliometric analysis revealed a consistent temporal trend in both the volume of publications and citations, underscoring the growing importance of pulse oximeters in digitally-enabled medical practice. Using the VOSviewer software(version 1.6.18), we discerned six primary research clusters: (1) measurement accuracy; (2) integration with the Internet of Things; (3) applicability across diverse pathologies; (4) telemedicine and mobile applications; (5) artificial intelligence and deep learning; and (6) utilization in anesthesiology, resuscitation, and intensive care departments. The findings of this study indicate the prospects for leveraging digital technologies in the use of pulse oximetry in various fields of medicine, with implications for advancing the understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cardio-respiratory pathologies. The conducted patent and bibliometric analysis allowed the identification of technical solutions to reduce the risks associated with pulse oximetry: improving precision and validity, technically improved clinical diagnostic use, and the use of machine learning.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Adequate analgesic and antinociception levels are necessary to avoid adverse events such as movement or hemodynamic reactions. Although different monitoring systems estimating antinociception effect during general anesthesia are available, the performance of these indices is limited. The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model of the probability of movement if a standardized tetanic stimulation is applied to the patient, using the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal as input. Seventy-seven female patients, scheduled for ambulatory gynecologic surgical procedures under general anesthesia, were included. EEG segments of 45s, preceding tetanic stimulation, were split into epochs of 5s with no overlapping. Features from both time and frequency domain, including continuous wavelet transform (CWT), were considered. Five different machine learning (ML) models were tested: 1D CNN model for raw EEG signal, random forest classifier, XGBoost classifier and support vector classifier for extracted features and finally 2D CNN model for CWT scalogram. The results showed that the performance of the proposed ML models to predict movement to standardized tetanic stimulation through the EEG signal was almost equal to the performance of commercially available indices (AUC=0.73). This performance was improved (AUC=0.84) with ML methods in ensemble mode with pupil diameter and remifentanil effect site concentration. Indeed, prediction of movement to noxious stimulation through the EEG signal matches state of the art and could potentially be used in combination of other variables.

AB  - Effective pain management can significantly improve quality of life and outcomes for various types of patients (e.g. elderly, adult, young) and often requires assisted living for a significant number of people worldwide. In order to improve our understanding of patients' response to pain and needs for assisted living we need to develop adequate data processing techniques that would enable us to understand underlying interdependencies. To this purpose in this paper we develop several different algorithms that can predict the need for medically assisted living outcomes using a large database obtained as a part of the national health survey. As a part of the survey the respondents provided detailed information about general health care state, acute and chronic problems as well as personal perception of pain associated with performing two simple talks: walking on the flat surface and walking upstairs. We model the correspondent responses using multinomial random variables and propose structured deep learning models based on maximum likelihood estimation and machine learning for information fusion. For comparison purposes we also implement fully connected deep learning network and use its results as benchmark measurements. We evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques using the national survey data and split them into two parts used for training and testing. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed models can potentially be useful in forecasting the need for medically assisted living.

TI  - Brachial Plexus Nerve Trunk Recognition From Ultrasound Images: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Models
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brachial plexus block is a common regional anesthesia method widely used in upper limb surgery. Nowadays, ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block has been extensively used in clinical anesthesia. However, accurate brachial plexus block is highly dependent on the physician's experience, and a physician without extensive clinical experience may cause nerve injury when performing a nerve block. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the deep learning method can automatically identify the brachial plexus in ultrasound images and assist doctors in completing the brachial plexus block accurately and quickly. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the performance of different deep learning models in identifying brachial plexus (i.e., segmentation of brachial plexus) from ultrasonic images to explore the best models and training strategies for this task. To this end, we use a new dataset containing 340 brachial plexus ultrasound images annotated by three experienced clinicians. Among the 12 deep learning models we evaluated, U-Net achieves the best segmentation accuracy, with an intersection over union (IoU) of 68.50%. However, the number of U-Net parameters is very large, and it can only process 15 images per second. Compared to U-Net, LinkNet can process 142 images per second and achieve the second-best segmentation accuracy with an IoU of 66.27%. It achieves the balance between segmentation accuracy and processing efficiency, which has a good potential for the brachial plexus's real-time segmentation task.

TI  - Deep visual nerve tracking in ultrasound images
T2  - COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) becomes a standard procedure in surgical operations and pain management, offers the advantages of nerve localization, and provides region of interest anatomical structure visualization. Nerve tracking presents a crucial step for practicing UGRA and it is useful and important to develop a tool to facilitate this step. However, nerve tracking is a very challenging task that anesthetists can encounter due to the noise, artifacts, and nerve structure variability. Deep-learning has shown outstanding performances in computer vision task including tracking. Many deep-learning trackers have been proposed, where their performance depends on the application. While no deep-learning study exists for tracking the nerves in ultrasound images, this paper explores thirteen most recent deep-learning trackers for nerve tracking and presents a comparative study for the best deep-learning trackers on different types of nerves in ultrasound images. We evaluate the performance of the trackers in terms of accuracy, consistency, time complexity, and handling different nerve situations, such as disappearance and losing shape information. Through the experimentation, certain conclusions were noted on deep learning trackers performance. Overall: deep-learning trackers provide good performance and show a comparative performance for tracking different kinds of nerves in ultrasound images. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Artificial intelligence to evaluate postoperative pain based on facial expression recognition
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Pain intensity evaluation by self-report is difficult and biased in non-communicating people, which may contribute to inappropriate pain management. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate pain intensity based on automated facial expression analysis has not been evaluated in clinical conditions. Methods We trained and externally validated a deep-learning system (ResNet-18 convolutional neural network) to identify and classify 2810 facial expressions of 1189 patients, captured before and after surgery, according to their self-reported pain intensity using numeric rating scale (NRS, 0-10). AI performances were evaluated by accuracy (concordance between AI prediction and patient-reported pain intensity), sensitivity and specificity to diagnose pain >= 4/10 and >= 7/10. We then confronted AI performances with those of 33 nurses to evaluate pain intensity from facial expression in the same situation. Results In the external testing set (120 face images), the deep learning system was able to predict exactly the pain intensity among the 11 possible scores (0-10) in 53% of the cases with a mean error of 2.4 points. Its sensitivities to detect pain >= 4/10 and >= 7/10 were 89.7% and 77.5%, respectively. Nurses estimated the right NRS pain intensity with a mean accuracy of 14.9% and identified pain >= 4/10 and >= 7/10 with sensitivities of 44.9% and 17.0%. Conclusions Subject to further improvement of AI performances through further training, these results suggest that AI using facial expression analysis could be used to assist physicians to evaluate pain and detect severe pain, especially in people not able to report appropriately their pain by themselves. Significance These original findings represent a major step in the development of a fully automated, rapid, standardized and objective method based on facial expression analysis to measure pain and detect severe pain.

TI  - The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Quality and Safety
T2  - GLOBAL SPINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - As exponential expansion of computing capacity converges with unsustainable health care spending, a hopeful opportunity has emerged: the use of artificial intelligence to enhance health care quality and safety. These computer-based algorithms can perform the intricate and extremely complex mathematical operations of classification or regression on immense amounts of data to detect intricate and potentially previously unknown patterns in that data, with the end result of creating predictive models that can be utilized in clinical practice. Such models are designed to distinguish relevant from irrelevant data regarding a particular patient; choose appropriate perioperative care, intervention or surgery; predict cost of care and reimbursement; and predict future outcomes on a variety of anchored measures. If and when one is brought to fruition, an artificial intelligence platform could serve as the first legitimate clinical decision-making tool in spine care, delivering on the value equation while serving as a source for improving physician performance and promoting appropriate, efficient care in this era of financial uncertainty in health care.

TI  - Artificial intelligence enhanced ultrasound (AI-US) in a severe obese parturient: a case report
T2  - ULTRASOUND JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neuraxial anesthesia in obese parturients can be challenging due to anatomical and physiological modifications secondary to pregnancy; this led to growing popularity of spine ultrasound in this population for easing landmark identification and procedure execution.Integration of Artificial Intelligence with ultrasound (AI-US) for image enhancement and analysis has increased clinicians' ability to localize vertebral structures in patients with challenging anatomical conformation.Case presentation: We present the case of a parturient with extremely severe obesity, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) = 64.5 kg/m(2), in which the AI-Enabled Image Recognition allowed a successful placing of an epidural catheter.Conclusions: Benefits gained from AI-US implementation are multiple: immediate recognition of anatomical structures leads to increased first-attempt success rate, making easier the process of spinal anesthesia execution compared to traditional palpation methods, reducing needle placement time for spinal anesthesia and predicting best needle direction and target structure depth in peridural anesthesia.

TI  - Ultrasound Images Guided under Deep Learning in the Anesthesia Effect of the Regional Nerve Block on Scapular Fracture Surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to discuss the clinical characteristics of patients with scapular fracture, deep learning model was adopted in ultrasound images of patients to locate the anesthesia point of patients during scapular fracture surgery treated with the regional nerve block. 100 patients with scapular fracture who were hospitalized for emergency treatment in the hospital were recruited. Patients in the algorithm group used ultrasound-guided regional nerve block puncture, and patients in the control group used traditional body surface anatomy for anesthesia positioning. The ultrasound images of the scapula of the contrast group were used for the identification of the deep learning model and analysis of anesthesia acupuncture sites. The ultrasound images of the scapula anatomy of the patients in the contrast group were extracted, and the convolutional neural network model was employed for training and test. Moreover, the model performance was evaluated. It was found that the adoption of deep learning greatly improved the accuracy of the image. It took an average of 7.5 +/- 2.07 minutes from the time the puncture needle touched the skin to the completion of the injection in the algorithm group (treated with artificial intelligence ultrasound positioning). The operation time of the control group (anatomical positioning) averaged 10.2 +/- 2.62min. Moreover, there was a significant difference between the two groups (p<0.05). The method adopted in the contrast group had high positioning accuracy and good anesthesia effect, and the patients had reduced postoperative complications of patients (all P<0.005). The deep learning model can effectively improve the accuracy of ultrasound images and measure and assist the treatment of future clinical cases of scapular fractures. While improving medical efficiency, it can also accurately identify patient fractures, which has great adoption potential in improving the effect of surgical anesthesia.

M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - The rapid development of intelligent computer technology has promoted the improvement of people's living standards and the application of the entire intelligent system. In modern medicine, doctors use their accumulated experience and medical knowledge to diagnose diseases and draw conclusions. In order to effectively inherit the diagnosis experience accumulated by doctors, R&D personnel put forward the idea of using artificial intelligence technology to develop an intelligent auxiliary medical diagnosis system. Aiming at the abovementioned machine-learning problems in the medical field, this article mainly introduces the application research of propofol in oral and maxillofacial surgery anesthesia based on smart medical blockchain technology. This paper proposes a research method based on smart medical blockchain technology to assist propofol in oral and maxillofacial surgery anesthesia, including support vector machine data classification algorithm, decision tree data classification algorithm, and machine-learning-based LSTM neural network. Research experiments on the application of intelligent medical aid propofol in oral and maxillofacial surgery anesthesia are conducted. The experimental results in this paper show that the response time of the general business logic interface of the application system of propofol in oral and maxillofacial surgery anesthesia based on smart medical blockchain technology is about 41 milliseconds, which can better help doctors in anesthesia and related treatments.

TI  - A real-time anatomy identification via tool based on artificial intelligence for ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block procedures: an accuracy study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to assess the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based real-time anatomy identification software specifically developed to ease image interpretation intended for ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block (UGPNB). Forty healthy participants (20 women, 20 men) were enrolled to perform interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks under ultrasound guidance using AI software by anesthesiology trainees. During block practice by a trainee, once the software indicates 100% scan success of each block associated anatomic landmarks, both raw and labeled ultrasound images were saved, assessed, and validated using a 5-point scale by expert validators. When trainees reached 100% scan success, accuracy scores of the validators were noted. Correlation analysis was used whether the relationship (r) according to demographics (gender, age, and body mass index: BMI) and block type exist. The BMI (kg/m(2)) and age (year) of participants were 22.2 +/- 3 and 32.2 +/- 5.25, respectively. Assessment scores of validators for all blocks were similar in male and female individuals. Mean assessment scores of validators were not significantly different according to age and BMI except for TAP block, which was inversely correlated with age and BMI (p = 0.01). AI technology can successfully interpret anatomical structures in real-time sonography while assisting young anesthesiologists during UGPNB practice.

TI  - Techniques for minimizing sedation in pediatric MRI
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - MRI is used widely in infants and young children. However, in these young cases deep sedation or general anesthesia is often required to minimize motion artifacts during MRI examinations. Although the benefits of MR typically outweigh the potential risks of sedation when delivered by an experienced team, there are increasing concerns regarding the affect of sedation on young children. There continues to be a push to develop various strategies that can minimize the need for sedation. The present review summarizes several technical and clinical approaches that can help decrease the need for sedation in the pediatric patient. Optimization of the MRI environment, the role of child life specialists, feed-and-bundle and distraction techniques, noise-reduction methods, artificial intelligence, and MRI advances to decrease both scan times and motion artifacts will be discussed.

TI  - Revolutionizing Patient Care: A Comprehensive Review of Artificial Intelligence Applications in Anesthesia
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - This review explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and anesthesia, examining its transformative impact on patient care across various phases. Beginning with a historical overview of anesthesia, we highlight the critical role of technological advancements in ensuring optimal patient outcomes. The emergence of AI in healthcare sets the stage for a comprehensive analysis of its applications in anesthesia. In the preoperative phase, AI facilitates personalized risk assessments and decision support, optimizing anesthesia planning and drug dosage predictions. Moving to the intraoperative phase, we delve into AI's role in monitoring and control through sophisticated anesthesia monitoring and closed-loop systems. Additionally, we discuss the integration of robotics and AI-guided procedures, revolutionizing surgical assistance. Transitioning to the postoperative phase, we explore AI-driven postoperative monitoring, predictive analysis for complications, and the integration of AI into rehabilitation programs and long-term follow-up.These new applications redefine patient recovery, emphasizing personalized care and proactive interventions. However, the integration of AI in anesthesia poses challenges and ethical considerations. Data security, interpretability, and bias in AI algorithms demand scrutiny. Moreover, the evolving patient doctor relationship in an AI-driven care landscape requires a delicate balance between efficiency and human touch. Looking forward, we discuss the future directions of AI in anesthesia, anticipating advances in technology and AI algorithms. The integration of AI into routine clinical practice and its potential impact on anesthesia education and training are explored, emphasizing the need for collaboration, education, and ethical guidelines. This review provides a comprehensive overview of AI applications in anesthesia, offering insights into the present landscape, challenges, and future directions. The synthesis of historical perspectives, current applications, and future possibilities underscores the transformative potential of AI in revolutionizing patient care within the dynamic field of anesthesia.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods allow for automatic assessment of pain intensity based on continuous monitoring and processing of subtle changes in sensory signals, including facial expression, body movements, and crying frequency. Currently, there is a large and growing need for expanding current AI-based approaches to the assessment of postoperative pain in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). In contrast to acute procedural pain in the clinic, the NICU has neonates emerging from postoperative sedation, usually intubated, and with variable energy reserves for manifesting forceful pain responses. Here, we present a novel multi-modal approach designed, developed, and validated for assessment of neonatal postoperative pain in the challenging NICU setting. Our approach includes a robust network capable of efficient reconstruction of missing modalities (e.g., obscured facial expression due to intubation) using an unsupervised spatio-temporal feature learning with a generative model for learning the joint features. Our approach generates the final pain score along with the intensity using an attentional cross-modal feature fusion. Using experimental dataset from postoperative neonates in the NICU, our pain assessment approach achieves superior performance (AUC 0.906, accuracy 0.820) as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Creation of an artificial intelligence model for intubation difficulty classification by deep learning (convolutional neural network) using face images: an observational study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Tracheal intubation is the gold standard for securing the airway, and it is not uncommon to encounter intubation difficulties in intensive care units and emergency rooms. Currently, there is a need for an objective measure to assess intubation difficulties in emergency situations by physicians, residents, and paramedics who are unfamiliar with tracheal intubation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently used in medical imaging owing to advanced performance. We aimed to create an AI model to classify intubation difficulties from the patient's facial image using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which links the facial image with the actual difficulty of intubation. Methods Patients scheduled for surgery at Yamagata University Hospital between April and August 2020 were enrolled. Patients who underwent surgery with altered facial appearance, surgery with altered range of motion in the neck, or intubation performed by a physician with less than 3 years of anesthesia experience were excluded. Sixteen different facial images were obtained from the patients since the day after surgery. All images were judged as "Easy"/"Difficult" by an anesthesiologist, and an AI classification model was created using deep learning by linking the patient's facial image and the intubation difficulty. Receiver operating characteristic curves of actual intubation difficulty and AI model were developed, and sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated; median AUC was used as the result. Class activation heat maps were used to visualize how the AI model classifies intubation difficulties. Results The best AI model for classifying intubation difficulties from 16 different images was generated in the supine-side-closed mouth-base position. The accuracy was 80.5%; sensitivity, 81.8%; specificity, 83.3%; AUC, 0.864; and 95% confidence interval, [0.731-0.969], indicating that the class activation heat map was concentrated around the neck regardless of the background; the AI model recognized facial contours and identified intubation difficulties. Conclusion This is the first study to apply deep learning (CNN) to classify intubation difficulties using an AI model. We could create an AI model with an AUC of 0.864. Our AI model may be useful for tracheal intubation performed by inexperienced medical staff in emergency situations or under general anesthesia.

TI  - A Transformer-Based Prediction Method for Depth of Anesthesia During Target-Controlled Infusion of Propofol and Remifentanil
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately predicting anesthetic effects is essential for target-controlled infusion systems. The traditional (PK-PD) models for Bispectral index (BIS) prediction require manual selection of model parameters, which can be challenging in clinical settings. Recently proposed deep learning methods can only capture general trends and may not predict abrupt changes in BIS. To address these issues, we propose a transformer-based method for predicting the depth of anesthesia (DOA) using drug infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Our method employs long short-term memory (LSTM) and gate residual network (GRN) networks to improve the efficiency of feature fusion and applies an attention mechanism to discover the interactions between the drugs. We also use label distribution smoothing and reweighting losses to address data imbalance. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms traditional PK-PD models and previous deep learning methods, effectively predicting anesthetic depth under sudden and deep anesthesia conditions.

TI  - Automated tracking of level of consciousness and delirium in critical illness using deep learning
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over- and under-sedation are common in the ICU, and contribute to poor ICU outcomes including delirium. Behavioral assessments, such as Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) for monitoring levels of sedation and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for detecting signs of delirium, are often used. As an alternative, brain monitoring with electroencephalography (EEG) has been proposed in the operating room, but is challenging to implement in ICU due to the differences between critical illness and elective surgery, as well as the duration of sedation. Here we present a deep learning model based on a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks that automatically tracks both the level of consciousness and delirium using frontal EEG signals in the ICU. For level of consciousness, the system achieves a median accuracy of 70% when allowing prediction to be within one RASS level difference across all patients, which is comparable or higher than the median technician-nurse agreement at 59%. For delirium, the system achieves an AUC of 0.80 with 69% sensitivity and 83% specificity at the optimal operating point. The results show it is feasible to continuously track level of consciousness and delirium in the ICU.

TI  - Snakebite Advice and Counseling From Artificial Intelligence: An Acute Venomous Snakebite Consultation With ChatGPT
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Snakebites, particularly from venomous species, present a significant global public health challenge. Access to accurate and timely information regarding snakebite prevention, recognition, and management is crucial for minimizing morbidity and mortality. Artificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer), have the potential to revolutionize the dissemination of medical information and improve patient education and satisfaction.Methods: This study aimed to explore the utility of ChatGPT, an advanced language model, in simulating acute venomous snakebite consultations. Nine hypothetical questions based on comprehensive snakebite management guidelines were posed to ChatGPT, and the responses were evaluated by clinical toxicologists and emergency medicine physicians.Results: ChatGPT provided accurate and informative responses related to the immediate management of snakebites, the urgency of seeking medical attention, symptoms, and health issues following venomous snakebites, the role of antivenom, misconceptions about snakebites, recovery, pain management, and prevention strategies. The model highlighted the importance of seeking professional medical care and adhering to healthcare practitioners' advice. However, some limitations were identified, including outdated knowledge, lack of personalization, and inability to consider regional variations and individual characteristics.Conclusion: ChatGPT demonstrated proficiency in generating intelligible and well-informed responses related to venomous snakebites. It offers accessible and real-time advice, making it a valuable resource for preliminary information, education, and triage support in remote or underserved areas. While acknowledging its limitations, such as the need for up-to-date information and personalized advice, ChatGPT can serve as a supplementary source of information to complement professional medical consultation and enhance patient education. Future research should focus on addressing the identified limitations and establishing region-specific guidelines for snakebite management.

TI  - Deep Learning on Ultrasound Images Visualizes the Femoral Nerve with Good Precision
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of hip fractures per year worldwide is estimated to reach 6 million by the year 2050. Despite the many advantages of regional blockades when managing pain from such a fracture, these are used to a lesser extent than general analgesia. One reason is that the opportunities for training and obtaining clinical experience in applying nerve blocks can be a challenge in many clinical settings. Ultrasound image guidance based on artificial intelligence may be one way to increase nerve block success rate. We propose an approach using a deep learning semantic segmentation model with U-net architecture to identify the femoral nerve in ultrasound images. The dataset consisted of 1410 ultrasound images that were collected from 48 patients. The images were manually annotated by a clinical professional and a segmentation model was trained. After training the model for 350 epochs, the results were validated with a 10-fold cross-validation. This showed a mean Intersection over Union of 74%, with an interquartile range of 0.66-0.81.

M3  - Review
AB  - The practice of anesthesiology is inextricably dependent upon technology. Anesthetics were first made possible, then increasingly safe, and now more scalable and efficient in part due to advances in monitoring and delivery technology. Herein, we discuss salient advances of the last three years in the technology of anesthesiology. Consumer technology and telemedicine have exploded onto the scene of outpatient medicine, and perioperative management is no exception. Preoperative evaluations have been done via teleconference, and copious consumer-generated health data is available. Regulators have acknowledged the vast potential found in the transfer of consumer technology to medical practice, but issues of privacy, data ownership/security, and validity remain. Inside the operating suite, monitoring has become less invasive, and clinical decision support systems are common. These technologies are susceptible to the "garbage in, garbage out" conundrum plaguing artificial intelligence, but they will improve as network latency decreases. Automation looms large in the future of anesthesiology as closed-loop anesthesia delivery systems are being tested in combination (moving toward a comprehensive system). Moving forward, consumer health companies will search for applications of their technology, and loosely regulated health markets will see earlier adoption of next-generation technology. Innovations coming to anesthesia will need to account for human factors as the anesthesia provider is increasingly considered a component of the patient care apparatus.

TI  - Ensemble Deep Learning Model using Random Forest for Patient Shock Detection
T2  - KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital healthcare combined with telemedicine services in the form of convergence with digital technology and AI is developing rapidly. Digital healthcare research is being conducted on many conditions including shock. However, the causes of shock are diverse, and the treatment is very complicated, requiring a high level of medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose a shock detection method based on the correlation between shock and data extracted from hemodynamic monitoring equipment. From the various parameters expressed by this equipment, four parameters closely related to patient shock were used as the input data for a machine learning model in order to detect the shock. Using the four parameters as input data, that is, feature values, a random forest-based ensemble machine learning model was constructed. The value of the mean arterial pressure was used as the correct answer value, the so called label value, to detect the patient's shock state. The performance was then compared with the decision tree and logistic regression model using a confusion matrix. The average accuracy of the random forest model was 92.80%, which shows superior performance compared to other models. We look forward to our work playing a role in helping medical staff by making recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of complex and difficult cases of shock.

T2  - Anesthesia and analgesia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study explored physician anesthesiologists' knowledge, exposure, and perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) and their associations with attitudes and expectations regarding its use in clinical practice. The findings highlight the importance of understanding anesthesiologists' perspectives for the successful integration of AI into anesthesiology, as AI has the potential to revolutionize the field.METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 27,056 US physician anesthesiologists was conducted to assess their knowledge, perceptions, and expectations regarding the use of AI in clinical practice. The primary outcome measured was attitude toward the use of AI in clinical practice, with scores of 4 or 5 on a 5-point Likert scale indicating positive attitudes. The anticipated impact of AI on various aspects of professional work was measured using a 3-point Likert scale. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between participant responses and attitudes toward the use of AI in clinical practice.RESULTS: A 2021 survey of 27,056 US physician anesthesiologists received 1086 responses (4% response rate). Most respondents were male (71%), active clinicians (93%) under 45 (34%). A majority of anesthesiologists (61%) had some knowledge of AI and 48% had a positive attitude toward using AI in clinical practice. While most respondents believed that AI can improve health care efficiency (79%), timeliness (75%), and effectiveness (69%), they are concerned that its integration in anesthesiology could lead to a decreased demand for anesthesiologists (45%) and decreased earnings (45%). Within a decade, respondents expected AI would outperform them in predicting adverse perioperative events (83%), formulating pain management plans (67%), and conducting airway exams (45%). The absence of algorithmic transparency (60%), an ambiguous environment regarding malpractice (47%), and the possibility of medical errors (47%) were cited as significant barriers to the use of AI in clinical practice. Respondents indicated that their motivation to use AI in clinical practice stemmed from its potential to enhance patient outcomes (81%), lower health care expenditures (54%), reduce bias (55%), and boost productivity (53%). Variables associated with positive attitudes toward AI use in clinical practice included male gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; P < .001), 20+ years of experience (OR, 1.8; P < .01), higher AI knowledge (OR, 2.3; P = .01), and greater AI openness (OR, 10.6; P < .01). Anxiety about future earnings was associated with negative attitudes toward AI use in clinical practice (OR, 0.54; P < .01).CONCLUSIONS: Understanding anesthesiologists' perspectives on AI is essential for the effective integration of AI into anesthesiology, as AI has the potential to revolutionize the field.

Regional social inequities, as measuredby spatial indices such as area deprivation and social vulnerability indices, independently contribute todifferences in perioperative and neurodegenerative outcomes. Data also support a significant associationbetween neighborhood-level area deprivation indices with Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology. Despiteemerging evidence linking social determinants of health with disparities in postoperative outcomes in olderadults, investigations in these areas increasingly require expertise with disparate subject matters, includingclinical perioperative practice, geriatrics, neuropsychology, social determinants of health, geospatial analyses,and even artificial intelligence.

AB  - This article aims to provide a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL)-based solution to the automated drug infusion field. The learning policy is divided into the tasks of: 1) learning trajectory generative model and 2) planning policy model. The proposed deep infusion assistant policy gradient (DIAPG) model draws inspiration from adversarial autoencoders (AAEs) and learns latent representations of hypnotic depth trajectories. Given the trajectories drawn from the generative model, the planning policy infers a dose of propofol for stable sedation of a patient under total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using propofol and remifentanil. Through extensive evaluation, the DIAPG model can effectively stabilize bispectral index (BIS) and effect site concentration given a potentially time-varying target sequence. The proposed DIAPG shows an increased performance of 530% and 15% when a human expert and a standard reinforcement algorithm are used to infuse drugs, respectively.

TI  - What we can learn from Big Data about factors influencing perioperative outcome
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review This narrative review will discuss what value Big Data has to offer anesthesiology and aims to highlight recently published articles of large databases exploring factors influencing perioperative outcome. Additionally, the future perspectives of Big Data and its major pitfalls will be discussed. Recent findings The potential of Big Data has given an incentive to create nationwide and anesthesia-initiated registries like the MPOG and NACOR. These large databases have contributed in elucidating some of the rare perioperative complications, such as declined cognition after exposure to general anesthesia and epidural hematomas in parturients. Additionally, they are useful in finding patterns such as similar outcome in subtypes of beta-blockers and lower incidence of pneumonia in preoperative influenza vaccinations in the elderly. Big Data is becoming increasingly popular with the collaborative collection of registries offering anesthesia a way to explore rare perioperative complications and outcome to encourage further hypotheses testing. Although Big Data has its flaws in security, lack of expertise and methodological concerns, the future potential of analytics combined with genomics, machine learning and real-time decision support looks promising.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The role of artificial intelligence in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia is explored in a recent study by Bowness and colleagues, published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. The investigators showed that non-expert ability to identify key sono-anatomical structures was improved with the assistance of proprietary artificial intelligence software. Whether such software could increase learning efficiency, and thereby patient access, to regional anaesthesia, will require further study.

TI  - Evaluating the effect of an artificial intelligence system on the anesthesia quality control during gastrointestinal endoscopy with sedation: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sedative gastrointestinal endoscopy is extensively used worldwide. An appropriate degree of sedation leads to more acceptability and satisfaction. Artificial intelligence has rapidly developed in the field of digestive endoscopy in recent years and we have constructed a mature computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. This system can identify the remaining parts to be examined in real-time endoscopic procedures, which may help anesthetists use anesthetics properly to keep patients in an appropriate degree of sedation. Aims This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the CAD system on anesthesia quality control during gastrointestinal endoscopy. Methods We recruited 154 consecutive patients at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, including 76 patients in the CAD group and 78 in the control group. Anesthetists in the CAD group were able to see the CAD system's indications, while anesthetists in the control group could not. The primary outcomes included emergence time (from examination completion to spontaneous eye opening when doctors called the patients' names), recovery time (from examination completion to achievement of the primary recovery endpoints) and patient satisfaction scores. The secondary outcomes included anesthesia induction time (from sedative administration to successful sedation), procedure time (from scope insertion to scope withdrawal), total dose of propofol, vital signs, etc. This trial was registered in the Primary Registries of the WHO Registry Network, with registration number ChiCTR2100042621. Results Emergence time in the CAD group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (p < 0.01). The recovery time was also significantly shorter in the CAD group (p < 0.01). Patients in the CAD group were significantly more satisfied with their sedation than those in control group (p < 0.01). Vital signs were stable during the examinations in both groups. Propofol doses during the examinations were comparable between the two groups. Conclusion This CAD system possesses great potential for anesthesia quality control. It can improve patient satisfaction during endoscopic examinations with sedation.

TI  - Prediction of Blood Pressure after Induction of Anesthesia Using Deep Learning: A Feasibility Study
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Anesthesia induction is associated with frequent blood pressure fluctuation such as hypotension and hypertension. If it is possible to precisely predict blood pressure a few minutes ahead, anesthesiologists can proactively give anesthetic management before patients develop hemodynamic problem. The objective of this study is to develop a real-time model for predicting 3 -min-ahead blood pressure from the start of anesthesia induction to surgical incision. We used only vital signs and anesthesia-related data obtained during anesthesia-induction phase and designed a bidirectional recurrent neural network followed by fully connected layers. We conducted experiments on our collected data of 102 patients, and obtained mean absolute errors between 8.2 mmHg and 11.1 mmHg and standard deviation between 8.7 mmHg and 12.7 mmHg. The average elapsed time for prediction of a batch of 100 unseen data was about 26.56 milliseconds. We believe that this study shows feasibility of real-time prediction of future blood pressures, and the performance will be improved by collecting more data and finding better model structures.

TI  - [Development of a deep learning based prototype artificial intelligence system for the detection of dental caries in children].
T2  - Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To develop a prototype artificial intelligence image recognition system for detecting dental caries, especially those without cavities, in children. Methods: Seven hundred and twelve intraoral photos, which were taken by dental professionals using a digital camera from October 2013 to June 2020 in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, were collected from the children who received dental treatment under general anesthesia. The well-documented post-treatment electronic dental record of each child was identified as label standard to determine whether the teeth were carious and the type of caries types such as caries that had become cavities (caries with cavities), pit and fissure caries that had not become cavities (pit and fissure caries) and proximal caries which the marginal ridge enamel had not been destroyed (proximal caries). The various teeth and caries types were labeled by pediatric dentists using VoTT software (Windows 2.1.0, Microsoft, U S A). There were five labeled groups: pit and fissure caries, approximal caries, non-carious approximal surfaces, caries with cavities and teeth without caries (including intact fillings). Each group was randomly divided into training dataset, validation dataset and test dataset at a ratio of 6.4∶1.6∶2.0 by using random number table. After using the labeled training dataset for deep learning training, a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) image recognition system for detecting dental caries was established, with the caries probability greater than 50.0% as the criterion for determining caries. Sensitivity and accuracy were used as indicators of recognition specificity. Results: Seven hundred and twelve single-jaw intraoral photographs were segmented and annotated into 953 pit and fissure caries, 1 002 approximal caries, 3 008 caries with cavities, 3 189 teeth without caries and 862 non-carious approximal surfaces, totaly 9 014 labels. The sensitivities and specificities of the test set were 96.0% and 97.0% for caries with cavities, 95.8% and 99.0% for pit and fissure caries and 88.1% and 97.1% for approximal caries. Conclusions: The current AI system developed based on deep learning of the intra-oral photos in the present study showed the ability to detect dental caries. Furthermore, the AI system could accurately verify different types of dental caries such as caries with cavities, pit and fissure caries and proximal caries.

TI  - A descriptive appraisal of quality of reporting in a cohort of machine learning studies in anesthesiology
T2  - ANAESTHESIA CRITICAL CARE & PAIN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The field of machine learning is being employed more and more in medicine. However, studies have shown that the quality of published studies frequently lacks completeness and adherence to published reporting guidelines. This assessment has not been done in the subspecialty of anesthesiology. Methods: We appraised the quality of reporting of a convenience sample of 67 peer-reviewed publications sourced from the scoping review by Hashimoto et al. Each publication was appraised on the presence of reporting elements (reporting compliance) selected from 4 peer-reviewed guidelines for reporting on machine learning studies. Results are described in several cross sections, including by section of manuscript (e.g. abstract, introduction, etc.), year of publication, impact factor of journal, and impact of publication. Results: On average, reporting compliance was 64% +/- 13%. There was marked heterogeneity of reporting based on section of manuscript. There was a mild trend towards increased quality of reporting with increasing impact factor of journal of publication and increasing average number of citations per year since publication, and no trend regarding recency of publication. Conclusion: The quality of reporting of machine learning studies in anesthesiology is on par with other fields, but can benefit from improvement, especially in presenting methodology, results, and discussion points, including interpretation of models and pitfalls therein. Clinicians in today's learning health systems will benefit from skills in appraisal of evidence. Several reporting guidelines have been released, and updates to mainstream guidelines are under development, which we hope will usher in improvement in reporting quality.

AB  - A third of all patients are at risk for a serious adverse event, including death, in the first month after undergoing a major surgery. Most of these events will occur within 24hours of the operation but are unlikely to occur in the operating room or postanesthesia care unit. Most opioid-induced respiratory depression events in the postoperative period resulted in death (55%) or anoxic brain injury (22%). A future state of mature artificial intelligence and machine learning will improve situational awareness of acute clinical deterioration, minimize alert fatigue, and facilitate early intervention to minimize poor outcomes.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and opioid use: a narrative review
T2  - BMJ INNOVATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Opioids are strong pain medications that can be essential for acute pain. However, opioids are also commonly used for chronic conditions and illicitly where there are well-recognised concerns about the balance of their benefits and harms. Technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) are being developed to examine and optimise the use of opioids. Yet, this research has not been synthesised to determine the types of AI models being developed and the application of these models.Methods We aimed to synthesise studies exploring the use of AI in people taking opioids. We searched three databases: the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase and Medline on 4 January 2021. Studies were included if they were published after 2010, conducted in a real-life community setting involving humans and used AI to understand opioid use. Data on the types and applications of AI models were extracted and descriptively analysed.Results Eighty-one articles were included in our review, representing over 5.3 million participants and 14.6 million social media posts. Most (93%) studies were conducted in the USA. The types of AI technologies included natural language processing (46%) and a range of machine learning algorithms, the most common being random forest algorithms (36%). AI was predominately applied for the surveillance and monitoring of opioids (46%), followed by risk prediction (42%), pain management (10%) and patient support (2%). Few of the AI models were ready for adoption, with most (62%) being in preliminary stages.Conclusions Many AI models are being developed and applied to understand opioid use. However, there is a need for these AI technologies to be externally validated and robustly evaluated to determine whether they can improve the use and safety of opioids.

TI  - Monitoring of conscious sedation in endoscopy with artificial intelligence
T2  - GASTROENTEROLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Propofol sedation during endoscopic interventions is a well-established and generally safe procedure. However, the risk for adverse events increases considerably in long interventions, emergencies and patients with certain comorbidities. To this day, there is no objective device to monitor sedation depth. Brain monitors have been developed for general anesthesia. These devices are based on an automatic analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Studies to utilize brain monitors from anesthesia in conscious sedation during endoscopy did not show any benefit. This article provides a review of EEG-based monitoring of sedation depth in conscious sedation with classic methods and neural networks. Special characteristics of time series analysis and corresponding network architectures are discussed.

T2  - Procedia computer science
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the criticality of timely intervention in a situation exacerbated by a shortage in medical staff and equipment. Pain-level screening is the initial step toward identifying the severity of patient conditions. Automatic recognition of state and feelings help in identifying patient symptoms to take immediate adequate action and providing a patient-centric medical plan tailored to a patient's state. In this paper, we propose a framework for pain-level detection for deployment in the United Arab Emirates and assess its performance using the most used approaches in the literature. Our results show that a deployment of a pain-level deep learning detection framework is promising in identifying the pain level accurately.

TI  - Optimizing Motor Intention Detection With Deep Learning: Towards Management of Intraoperative Awareness
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This article shows the interest in deep learning techniques to detect motor imagery (MI) from raw electroencephalographic (EEG) signals when a functional electrical stimulation is added or not. Impacts of electrode montages and bandwidth are also reported. The perspective of this work is to improve the detection of intraoperative awareness during general anesthesia. Methods: Various architectures of EEGNet were investigated to optimize MI detection. They have been compared to the state-of-the-art classifiers in Brain-Computer Interfaces (based on Riemannian geometry, linear discriminant analysis), and other deep learning architectures (deep convolution network, shallow convolutional network). EEG data were measured from 22 participants performing motor imagery with and without median nerve stimulation. Results: The proposed architecture of EEGNet reaches the best classification accuracy (83.2%) and false-positive rate (FPR 19.0%) for a setup with only six electrodes over the motor cortex and frontal lobe and for an extended 4-38 Hz EEG frequency range while the subject is being stimulated via a median nerve. Configurations with a larger number of electrodes result in higher accuracy (94.5%) and FPR (6.1%) for 128 electrodes (and respectively 88.0% and 12.9% for 13 electrodes). Conclusion: The present work demonstrates that using an extended EEG frequency band and a modified EEGNet deep neural network increases the accuracy of MI detection when used with as few as 6 electrodes which include frontal channels. Significance: The proposed method contributes to the development of Brain-Computer Interface systems based on MI detection from EEG.

TI  - Examining the impact perceptual learning artificial-intelligence-based on the incidence of paresthesia when performing the ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic block: simulation-based randomized study
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the impact of artificial-intelligence perceptual learning when performing the ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic block.Methods: This simulation-based randomized study enrolled residents who underwent ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block training at the Department of Anesthesiology of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital between January 2022 and February 2022. Residents were randomly divided into a traditional teaching group and an AI teaching group. All residents attended the same nerve block theory courses, while those in the AI teaching group participated in training course using an AI-assisted nerve identification system based on a convolutional neural network instead of traditional training.Results: A total of 40 residents were included. The complication rates of paresthesia during puncture in the first month of clinical sciatic nerve block practice after training were significantly lower in the AI teaching group than in the traditional teaching group [11 (4.12%) vs. 36 (14.06%), P = 0.000093]. The rates of paresthesia/pain during injection were significantly lower in the AI teaching group than in the traditional teaching group [6 (2.25%) vs. 17 (6.64%), P = 0.025]. The Assessment Checklist for Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia (32 +/- 3.8 vs. 29.4 +/- 3.9, P = 0.001) and nerve block self-rating scores (7.53 +/- 1.62 vs. 6.49 +/- 1.85, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the AI teaching group than in the traditional teaching group. There were no significant differences in the remaining indicators.Conclusion: The inclusion of an AI-assisted nerve identification system based on convolutional neural network as part of the training program for ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block via the popliteal approach may reduce the incidence of nerve paresthesia and this might be related to improved perceptual learning.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To analyze the research hotspots and development trend of the application of artificial intelligence to the field of anesthesia using bibliometrics, and to provide reference for further research. Methods Based on the results of the literature search on artificial intelligence and anesthesia in the Web of Science database, Citespace5.5. R2 and VOSviewer1.6.16 softwares were used to draw the knowledge map of scientific research cooperation networks, keywords and citations and implement bibliometric analysis. Results A total of 298 studies were included, and the number of publications and citation frequency in the early period were maintained at a very low level for a long time, and both showed an increasing trend year by year after 2017. These studies came from 45 countries∕regions, among which the United States had the highest publications. Harvard University was the institution with the highest number of papers. The author with the highest publications was Matava Clyde, who worked at the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children. Research on the application of artificial intelligence to the field of anesthesia had mainly focused on artificial intelligence algorithms, event prediction, anesthesia control and pain management. Conclusions The application of artificial intelligence to the field of anesthesia has gradually attracted the attention of the academic community in the past five years, and the number of publications and citation frequency have increased drastically. The academic achievements in this field in China still have a gap compared with the world advanced level, and more in-depth researches can be conducted in the future for the hot directions.

TI  - A fully-automatic semi-supervised deep learning model for difficult airway assessment
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Difficult airway conditions represent a substantial challenge for clinicians. Predicting such conditions is essential for subsequent treatment planning, but the reported diagnostic accuracies are still quite low. To overcome these challenges, we developed a rapid, non-invasive, cost-effective, and highly-accurate deep-learning approach to identify difficult airway conditions through photographic image analysis.Methods: For each of 1000 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia, images were captured from 9 specific and different viewpoints. The collected image set was divided into training and testing subsets in the ratio of 8:2. We used a semi-supervised deep-learning method to train and test an AI model for difficult airway prediction.Results: We trained our semi-supervised deep-learning model using only 30% of the labeled training samples (with the remaining 70% used without labels). We evaluated the model performance using metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The numerical values of these four metrics were found to be 90.00%, 89.58%, 90.13%, 81.13%, and 0.9435, respectively. For a fully-supervised learning scheme (with 100% of the labeled training samples used for model training), the corresponding values were 90.50%, 91.67%, 90.13%, 82.25%, and 0.9457, respectively. When three professional anesthesiologists conducted comprehensive evaluation, the corresponding results were 91.00%, 91.67%, 90.79%, 83.26%, and 0.9497, respectively. It can be seen that the semi-supervised deep learning model trained by us with only 30% labeled samples can achieve a comparable effect with the fully supervised learning model, but the sample labeling cost is smaller. Our method can achieve a good balance between performance and cost. At the same time, the results of the semi-supervised model trained with only 30% labeled samples were very close to the performance of human experts.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one to apply a semi-supervised deep-learning method in order to identify the difficulties of both mask ventilation and intubation. Our AI-based image analysis system can be used as an effective tool to identify patients with difficult airway conditions.Clinical trial registration: ChiCTR2100049879 (URL: http://www.chictr.org.cn).

TI  - Applying machine learning to continuously monitored physiological data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Review
AB  - The use of machine learning (ML) in healthcare has enormous potential for improving disease detection, clinical decision support, and workflow efficiencies. In this commentary, we review published and potential applications for the use of ML for monitoring within the hospital environment. We present use cases as well as several questions regarding the application of ML to the analysis of the vast amount of complex data that clinicians must interpret in the realm of continuous physiological monitoring. ML, especially employed in bidirectional conjunction with electronic health record data, has the potential to extract much more useful information out of this currently under-analyzed data source from a population level. As a data driven entity, ML is dependent on copious, high quality input data so that error can be introduced by low quality data sources. At present, while ML is being studied in hybrid formulations along with static expert systems for monitoring applications, it is not yet actively incorporated in the formal artificial learning sense of an algorithm constantly learning and updating its rules without external intervention. Finally, innovations in monitoring, including those supported by ML, will pose regulatory and medico-legal challenges, as well as questions regarding precisely how to incorporate these features into clinical care and medical education. Rigorous evaluation of ML techniques compared to traditional methods or other AI methods will be required to validate the algorithms developed with consideration of database limitations and potential learning errors. Demonstration of value on processes and outcomes will be necessary to support the use of ML as a feature in monitoring system development: Future research is needed to evaluate all AI based programs before clinical implementation in non-research settings.

TI  - MRI Techniques to Decrease Imaging Times in Children
T2  - RADIOGRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long acquisition times can limit the use of MRI in pediatric patients, and the use of sedation or general anesthesia is frequently necessary to facilitate diagnostic examinations. The use of sedation or anesthesia has disadvantages including increased cost and imaging time and potential risks to the patient. Reductions in imaging time may decrease or eliminate the need for sedation or general anesthesia. Over the past decade, a number of imaging techniques that can decrease imaging time have become commercially available. These products have been used increasingly in clinical practice and include parallel imaging, simultaneous multisection imaging, radial k-space acquisition, compressed sensing MRI reconstruction, and automated protocol selection software. The underlying concepts, supporting data, current clinical applications, and available products for each of these strategies are reviewed in this article. In addition, emerging techniques that are still under investigation may provide further reductions in imaging time, including artificial intelligence based reconstruction, gradient-controlled aliasing sampling and reconstruction, three-dimensional MR spectroscopy, and prospective motion correction. The preliminary results for these techniques are also discussed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Brain monitors which track quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures to monitor sedation levels are drug and patient specific. There is a need for robust sedation level monitoring systems to accurately track sedation levels across all drug classes, sex and age groups. Forty-four quantitative features estimated from a pooled dataset of 204 EEG recordings from 66 healthy adult volunteers who received either propofol, dexmedetomidine, or sevoflurane (all with and without remifentanil) were used in a machine learning based automated system to estimate the depth of sedation. Model training and evaluation were performed using leave-one-out cross validation methodology. We trained four machine learning models to predict sedation levels and evaluated the influence of remifentanil, age, and sex on the prediction performance. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the prediction model. The ensemble tree with bagging outperformed other machine learning models and predicted sedation levels with an AUC = 0.88 (0.81-0.90). There were significant differences in the prediction probability of the automated systems when trained and tested across different age groups and sex. The performance of the EEG based sedation level prediction system is drug, sex, and age specific. Nonlinear machine-learning models using quantitative EEG features can accurately predict sedation levels. The results obtained in this study may provide a useful reference for developing next generation EEG based sedation level prediction systems using advanced machine learning algorithms.

M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced into medicine and an AI-assisted medicine will be the future that we should help to shape. In particular, supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning will be the main methods to play a role in the implementation of AI. Severely ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are closely monitored in order to be able to quickly respond to any changes. These monitoring data can be used to train AI models to predict critical phases in advance, making an earlier reaction possible. To achieve this a large amount of clinical data are needed in order to train models and an external validation on independent cohorts should take place. Prospective studies with treatment of patients admitted to the ICU with AI assistance should show that they provide a benefit for patients. We present the most important resources from de-identified (anonymized) patient data on open-source use for AI research in intensive care medicine. The focus is on neurological diseases in the ICU, therefore, we provide an overview of existing models for prediction of outcome, vasospasms, intracranial pressure and levels of consciousness. To introduce the advantages of AI in the clinical routine, more AI-based models with larger datasets will be needed. To achieve this international cooperation is absolutely necessary. Clinical centers associated with universities are needed to provide a constant validation of applied models as these models can change during use or a bias can develop during the training. A strong commitment to AI research is important for Germany, not only with respect to academic achievements but also in the light of a rapidly growing influence of AI on the economy.

TI  - Automatic Localization of the Needle Target for Ultrasound-Guided Epidural Injections
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification of the needle target is crucial for effective epidural anesthesia. Currently, epidural needle placement is administered by a manual technique, relying on the sense of feel, which has a significant failure rate. Moreover, misleading the needle may lead to inadequate anesthesia, post dural puncture headaches, and other potential complications. Ultrasound offers guidance to the physician for identification of the needle target, but accurate interpretation and localization remain challenges. A hybrid machine learning system is proposed to automatically localize the needle target for epidural needle placement in ultrasound images of the spine. In particular, a deep network architecture along with a feature augmentation technique is proposed for automatic identification of the anatomical landmarks of the epidural space in ultrasound images. Experimental results of the target localization on planes of 3-D as well as 2-D images have been compared against an expert sonographer. When compared with the expert annotations, the average lateral and vertical errors on the planes of 3-D test data were 1 and 0.4 mm, respectively. On 2-D test data set, an average lateral error of 1.7 mm and vertical error of 0.8 mm were acquired.

TI  - New onset delirium prediction using machine learning and long short-term memory (LSTM) in electronic health record
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To develop and test an accurate deep learning model for predicting new onset delirium in hospitalized adult patients. Methods Using electronic health record (EHR) data extracted from a large academic medical center, we developed a model combining long short-term memory (LSTM) and machine learning to predict new onset delirium and compared its performance with machine-learning-only models (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, neural network, and LightGBM). The labels of models were confusion assessment method (CAM) assessments. We evaluated models on a hold-out dataset. We calculated Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) measures to gauge the feature impact on the model. Results A total of 331 489 CAM assessments with 896 features from 34 035 patients were included. The LightGBM model achieved the best performance (AUC 0.927 [0.924, 0.929] and F1 0.626 [0.618, 0.634]) among the machine learning models. When combined with the LSTM model, the final model's performance improved significantly (P = .001) with AUC 0.952 [0.950, 0.955] and F1 0.759 [0.755, 0.765]. The precision value of the combined model improved from 0.497 to 0.751 with a fixed recall of 0.8. Using the mean absolute SHAP values, we identified the top 20 features, including age, heart rate, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score, Morse fall risk score, pulse, respiratory rate, and level of care. Conclusion Leveraging LSTM to capture temporal trends and combining it with the LightGBM model can significantly improve the prediction of new onset delirium, providing an algorithmic basis for the subsequent development of clinical decision support tools for proactive delirium interventions.

TI  - Machine Learning for Postoperative Continuous Recovery Scores of Oncology Patients in Perioperative Care with Data from Wearables
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing post-operative recovery is a significant component of perioperative care, since this assessment might facilitate detecting complications and determining an appropriate discharge date. However, recovery is difficult to assess and challenging to predict, as no universally accepted definition exists. Current solutions often contain a high level of subjectivity, measure recovery only at one moment in time, and only investigate recovery until the discharge moment. For these reasons, this research aims to create a model that predicts continuous recovery scores in perioperative care in the hospital and at home for objective decision making. This regression model utilized vital signs and activity metrics measured using wearable sensors and the XGBoost algorithm for training. The proposed model described continuous recovery profiles, obtained a high predictive performance, and provided outcomes that are interpretable due to the low number of features in the final model. Moreover, activity features, the circadian rhythm of the heart, and heart rate recovery showed the highest feature importance in the recovery model. Patients could be identified with fast and slow recovery trajectories by comparing patient-specific predicted profiles to the average fast- and slow-recovering populations. This identification may facilitate determining appropriate discharge dates, detecting complications, preventing readmission, and planning physical therapy. Hence, the model can provide an automatic and objective decision support tool.

TI  - Visualizing Opioid-Use Variation in a Pediatric Perioperative Dashboard
T2  - APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Anesthesiologists integrate numerous variables to determine an opioid dose that manages patient nociception and pain while minimizing adverse effects. Clinical dashboards that enable physicians to compare themselves to their peers can reduce unnecessary variation in patient care and improve outcomes. However, due to the complexity of anesthetic dosing decisions, comparative visualizations of opioid-use patterns are complicated by case-mix differences between providers. Objectives This single-institution case study describes the development of a pediatric anesthesia dashboard and demonstrates how advanced computational techniques can facilitate nuanced normalization techniques, enabling meaningful comparisons of complex clinical data. Methods We engaged perioperative-care stakeholders at a tertiary care pediatric hospital to determine patient and surgical variables relevant to anesthesia decision-making and to identify end-user requirements for an opioid-use visualization tool. Case data were extracted, aggregated, and standardized. We performed multivariable machine learning to identify and understand key variables. We integrated interview findings and computational algorithms into an interactive dashboard with normalized comparisons, followed by an iterative process of improvement and implementation. Results The dashboard design process identified two mechanisms-interactive data filtration and machine-learning-based normalization-that enable rigorous monitoring of opioid utilization with meaningful case-mix adjustment. When deployed with real data encompassing 24,332 surgical cases, our dashboard identified both high and low opioid-use outliers with associated clinical outcomes data. Conclusion A tool that gives anesthesiologists timely data on their practice patterns while adjusting for case-mix differences empowers physicians to track changes and variation in opioid administration over time. Such a tool can successfully trigger conversation amongst stakeholders in support of continuous improvement efforts. Clinical analytics dashboards can enable physicians to better understand their practice and provide motivation to change behavior, ultimately addressing unnecessary variation in high impact medication use and minimizing adverse effects.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence: A New Tool in Operating Room Management. Role of Machine Learning Models in Operating Room Optimization
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a systematic review of literature to better understand the role of new technologies in the perioperative period; in particular we focus on the administrative and managerial Operating Room (OR) perspective. Studies conducted on adult (>= 18 years) patients between 2015 and February 2019 were deemed eligible. A total of 19 papers were included. Our review suggests that the use of Machine Learning (ML) in the field of OR organization has many potentials. Predictions of the surgical case duration were obtain with a good performance; their use could therefore allow a more precise scheduling, limiting waste of resources. ML is able to support even more complex models, which can coordinate multiple spaces simultaneously, as in the case of the post-anesthesia care unit and operating rooms. Types of Artificial Intelligence could also be used to limit another organizational problem, which has important economic repercussions: cancellation. Random Forest has proven effective in identifing surgeries with high risks of cancellation, allowing to plan preventive measures to reduce the cancellation rate accordingly. In conclusion, although data in literature are still limited, we believe that ML has great potential in the field of OR organization; however, further studies are needed to assess the effective role of these new technologies in the perioperative medicine.

CP  - 17th Ibero-American Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IBERAMIA)
CL  - Cartagena de Indias, COLOMBIA
AB  - Regional neuraxial analgesia is a safe method for pain relief during labor, but its effectiveness must be assessed carefully. As a non-invasive technique, thermal imaging is gaining increasing acclaim as an objective way to quantify blood flow redistribution-related warm modifications. Hence, thermal measurements are acquired under controlled conditions at different timestamps to determine the anesthesia depth by characterizing earlier thermal changes. However, the procedures during labor are limited by two main factors: a relatively small sample size is possible and thermal images cannot be acquired with both feet in the same position. This work implements an automatic semantic segmentation approach using five state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and an artifact removal algorithm based on morphological operators to deal with this problem. The obtained results are evaluated on two databases (acquired at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia sede Manizales and the SES Hospital Universitario de Caldas): controlled and uncontrolled environments for thermal data acquisition. Obtained results indicate that U-Mobilenetv2 approach outperforms the rest of the compared models.

TI  - Clinical Knowledge and Reasoning Abilities of AI Large Language Models in Anesthesiology: A Comparative Study on the ABA Exam.
T2  - medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Over the past decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has expanded significantly with increased adoption across various industries, including medicine. Recently, AI's large language models such as GPT-3, Bard, and GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable language capabilities. While previous studies have explored their potential in general medical knowledge tasks, here we assess their clinical knowledge and reasoning abilities in a specialized medical context. We study and compare their performances on both the written and oral portions of the comprehensive and challenging American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) exam, which evaluates candidates' knowledge and competence in anesthesia practice. In addition, we invited two board examiners to evaluate AI's answers without disclosing to them the origin of those responses. Our results reveal that only GPT-4 successfully passed the written exam, achieving an accuracy of 78% on the basic section and 80% on the advanced section. In comparison, the less recent or smaller GPT-3 and Bard models scored 58% and 47% on the basic exam, and 50% and 46% on the advanced exam, respectively. Consequently, only GPT-4 was evaluated in the oral exam, with examiners concluding that it had a high likelihood of passing the actual ABA exam. Additionally, we observe that these models exhibit varying degrees of proficiency across distinct topics, which could serve as an indicator of the relative quality of information contained in the corresponding training datasets. This may also act as a predictor for determining which anesthesiology subspecialty is most likely to witness the earliest integration with AI.

TI  - Assistive artificial intelligence for ultrasound image interpretation in regional anaesthesia: an external validation study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Ultrasonound is used to identify anatomical structures during regional anaesthesia and to guide needle insertion and injection of local anaesthetic. ScanNav Anatomy Peripheral Nerve Block (Intelligent Ultrasound, Cardiff, UK) is an artificial intelligence-based device that produces a colour overlay on real-time B-mode ultrasound to highlight anatomical structures of interest. We evaluated the accuracy of the artificial-intelligence colour overlay and its perceived influence on risk of adverse events or block failure. Methods: Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia experts acquired 720 videos from 40 volunteers (across nine anatomical regions) without using the device. The artificial-intelligence colour overlay was subsequently applied. Three more experts independently reviewed each video (with the original unmodified video) to assess accuracy of the colour overlay in relation to key anatomical structures (true positive/negative and false positive/negative) and the potential for highlighting to modify perceived risk of adverse events (needle trauma to nerves, arteries, pleura, and peritoneum) or block failure.Results: The artificial-intelligence models identified the structure of interest in 93.5% of cases (1519/1624), with a false-negative rate of 3.0% (48/1624) and a false-positive rate of 3.5% (57/1624). Highlighting was judged to reduce the risk of unwanted needle trauma to nerves, arteries, pleura, and peritoneum in 62.9-86.4% of cases (302/480 to 345/400), and to increase the risk in 0.0-1.7% (0/160 to 8/480). Risk of block failure was reported to be reduced in 81.3% of scans (585/720) and to be increased in 1.8% (13/720).Conclusions: Artificial intelligence-based devices can potentially aid image acquisition and interpretation in ultrasound -guided regional anaesthesia. Further studies are necessary to demonstrate their effectiveness in supporting training and clinical practice.Clinical trial registration: NCT04906018.

CL  - Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Hyderabad, INDONESIA
AB  - Model predictive control (MPC) has emerged as an excellent control strategy owing to its ability to include constraints in the control optimization and robustness to linear as well as highly non-linear systems. There are many challenges in real-time implementation of MPC on embedded devices, including computational complexity, numerical instability, and memory constraints. Advances in machine learning-based approaches have widened the scope to replace the traditional and intractable optimization algorithms with advanced algorithms. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based model predictive control (DNN-MPC) is presented. The proposed MPC uses recurrent neural network (RNN) to accurately predict the future output states based on the previous training data. Using deep neural networks for the real-time embedded implementation of MPC, on-line optimization is completely eliminated leaving only the evaluation of some linear equations. Closed-loop performance evaluation of the DNN-MPC is verified through hardware-in-loop (HIL) co-simulation on ARM microcontroller and a 4x speed-up in computational time for a single iteration is achieved over the conventional MPC. Detailed analysis of DNNMPC complexity (speed and memory requirement) is presented and compared with traditional MPC. Results show that the proposed DNN-MPC performs faster and with less memory footprints while retaining the controller performance.

TI  - Explainable, Fair, Reproducible and Collaborative Surgical Artificial Intelligence: Integrating data, algorithms and clinical reasoning for surgical risk assessment (XAI-IDEALIST)
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project SummaryIn the United States, the average American can expect to undergo seven surgical operations during a lifetime.Each year 150,000 surgical patients die, and 1.5 million develop a complication after surgery. Progress inmedical Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains halted by limited datasets and models with insufficient interpretability,transparency, fairness, and reproducibility that are difficult to implement and share across institutions. In theprevious funding period, in addition to 98 publications and 3 patents, a real-time intelligent surgical riskassessment system was successfully implemented at University of Florida. The overall objective of thisrenewal application is to develop a new conceptual framework for “Explainable, Fair, Reproducible, andCollaborative Medical AI” to provide a foundation for clinical implementation at scale. It will leverage theOneFlorida, a large clinical consortium of 22 hospitals serving 10 million patients in Florida, the nation’s thirdlargest state. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims.(1) External and prospective validation of novel interpretable, dynamic, actionable, fair and reproduciblealgorithmic toolkit for real-time surgical risk surveillance. (2) Developing and evaluating explainable AI platform(XAI-IDEALIST) for real-time surgical risk surveillance using human-grounded benchmarks. (3) Implementingand evaluating a federated learning approach with advanced privacy features for collaborative surgical riskmodel training. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) build the first surgicalFAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) AI-ready, large multicenter multimodal dataset, (2)Novel computational approaches accompanied by assessing fairness and reproducibility, (3) a multifacetedand full-stack explainable AI framework, and (4) federated learning capacity for privacy-preserving modeltrainingacross institutions. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems andcritical barriers, including (1) lack of AI-ready large surgical datasets, (2) lack of interpretable, dynamic,actionable, fair and reproducible surgical risk algorithms, (2) lack of a medical AI explainability platform, and (4)lack of a systematic approach for collaborative model training and sharing across institutions. Ultimately, theresults are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelongcomplications.

TI  - Identifying anatomical structures on ultrasound: assistive artificial intelligence in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia
T2  - CLINICAL ANATOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia involves visualizing sono-anatomy to guide needle insertion and the perineural injection of local anesthetic. Anatomical knowledge and recognition of anatomical structures on ultrasound are known to be imperfect amongst anesthesiologists. This investigation evaluates the performance of an assistive artificial intelligence (AI) system in aiding the identification of anatomical structures on ultrasound. Three independent experts in regional anesthesia reviewed 40 ultrasound scans of seven body regions. Unmodified ultrasound videos were presented side-by-side with AI-highlighted ultrasound videos. Experts rated the overall system performance, ascertained whether highlighting helped identify specific anatomical structures, and provided opinion on whether it would help confirm the correct ultrasound view to a less experienced practitioner. Two hundred and seventy-five assessments were performed (five videos contained inadequate views); mean highlighting scores ranged from 7.87 to 8.69 (out of 10). The Kruskal-Wallis H-test showed a statistically significant difference in the overall performance rating (chi(2)[6] = 36.719, asymptotic p < 0.001); regions containing a prominent vascular landmark ranked most highly. AI-highlighting was helpful in identifying specific anatomical structures in 1330/1334 cases (99.7%) and for confirming the correct ultrasound view in 273/275 scans (99.3%). These data demonstrate the clinical utility of an assistive AI system in aiding the identification of anatomical structures on ultrasound during ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia. Whilst further evaluation must follow, such technology may present an opportunity to enhance clinical practice and energize the important field of clinical anatomy amongst clinicians.

AB  - Effective post-operative pain management requires an accurate and frequent assessment of the pain experienced by the patients. The current gold-standard of pain assessment is through patient self-evaluation (e.g., numeric rating scale, NRS) which is subjective, prone to recall-bias, and does not provide comprehensive information of the pain intensity and its trends. We conducted a study to explore the potential of wearable biosensors and machine learning-based analysis of physiological parameters to estimate the pain intensity. The results from our study of post-operative knee surgery patients monitored over a period of 30 days demonstrate the feasibility of the system in ambulatory setting, with a substantial agreement (Cohen's Kappa = 0.70, 95% CI 0.68-0.72) between the pain intensity estimation and the patient reported numerical rating scale. Therefore, the wearable biosensors coupled with the machine learning-derived pain estimation are capable of remotely assessing the pain intensity.

TI  - Role of Artificial Intelligence in Colonoscopy: A Literature Review of the Past, Present, and Future Directions
T2  - TECHNIQUES AND INNOVATIONS IN GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Colonoscopy remains one of the most common procedures performed by gastroenterologists and is critical for early detection and management of precursors to colorectal cancer (CRC). Although CRC remains one of the deadliest malignancies, earlier detection of precancerous polyps is directly associated with increased patient survival. As such, quality metrics for colonoscopy, such as polyp detection and mucosal visualization, are key parameters that are directly tied to patient outcomes. Over the past 2 decades, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools have been tested and developed to augment colonoscopy performance and in 2021 resulted in the first-ever FDA-approved computeraided detection (CADe) tool. This narrative review begins by reviewing the evidence behind the use of CADe that led to FDA approval. Next, the review discusses the current evidence and technological approaches for computer-aided diagnosis for optical in situ histopathological differentiation of colorectal polyps, including narrow-band imaging, blue light imaging, and endocytoscopy. Studies are ongoing to develop systems to predict the depth of submucosal invasion and to assess endoscopic disease activity among patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The applications of AI/ML to quality improvement are explored, including real-time assessment of bowel preparation, detection of cecal intubation, and automated polyp reporting and surveillance recommendations using natural language processing. Despite initial cost concerns, models have suggested that CADe systems could result in long-term cost savings and are generally accepted by patients and gastroenterologists. There is some reservation in adopting computer-aided diagnosis systems among gastroenterologists due to medico-legal concerns. Future directions for AI/ML in colonoscopy include health system improvements, such as automating note writing, optimizing procedural scheduling, and predicting sedation needs.

AB  - Purpose of Review To critically appraise the literature on the application, methods, and advances in emergency electroencephalography (EEG).Recent Findings The development of rapid EEG (rEEG) technologies and other reduced montage approaches, along with advances in machine learning over the past decade, has increased the rate and access to EEG acquisition. These achievements have made EEG in the emergency setting a practical diagnostic technique for detecting seizures, suspected nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), altered mental status, stroke, and in the setting of sedation.Summary Growing evidence supports using EEG to expedite medical decision-making in the setting of suspected acute neurological injury. This review covers approaches to acquiring EEG in the emergency setting in the adult and pediatric populations. We also cover the clinical impact of this data, the time associated with emergency EEG, and the costs of acquiring EEG in these settings. Finally, we discuss the advances in artificial intelligence for rapid electrophysiological interpretation.

TI  - One of the first validations of an artificial intelligence algorithm for clinical use: The impact on intraoperative hypotension prediction and clinical decision-making
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - This review describes the steps and conclusions from the development and validation of an artificial intelligence algorithm (the Hypotension Prediction Index), one of the first machine learning predictive algorithms used in the operating room environment. The algorithm has been demonstrated to reduce intraoperative hypotension in two randomized controlled trials via real-time prediction of upcoming hypotensive events prompting anesthesiologists to act earlier, more often, and differently in managing impending hypotension. However, the algorithm entails no dynamic learning process that evolves from use in clinical patient care, meaning the algorithm is fixed, and furthermore provides no insight into the decisional process that leads to an early warning for intraoperative hypotension, which makes the algorithm a "black box." Many other artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms have these same disadvantages. Clinical validation of such algorithms is relatively new and requires more standardization, as guidelines are lacking or only now start to be drafted. Before adaptation in clinical practice, impact of artificial intelligence algorithms on clinical behavior, outcomes and economic advantages should be studied too.(c) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Non-Human Primate Model for Developing Closed-Loop Anesthesia Delivery Systems
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARYContinuous monitoring of physiological state (oxygenation, breathing, circulation) is a standard practice for allpatients receiving general anesthesia and sedation. Anesthetics produce their primary effects ofunconsciousness and antinociception by acting on molecular targets and neural circuits in the brain and centralnervous system. Nevertheless, continuous monitoring of brain function is not a practice requirement. It is nosurprise that brain dysfunction following general anesthesia is highly prevalent, particularly among the elderly.Similarly, COVID 19 patients who can be anesthetized for weeks in the intensive care unit, are often left withprofound brain dysfunction following termination of ventilatory support. Many years of research have shown thatthe level of unconsciousness of a patient receiving general anesthesia can be reliably tracked using real-timeprocessing of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. In recent years, dramatic advances have been made insensors, actuators, artificial intelligence and control theory algorithms. A highly plausible solution is thedevelopment of closed loop anesthesia delivery (CLAD) systems that determine in real time from the EEG thepatient’s level of unconsciousness and precisely control an anesthetic infusion to maintain the level at anappropriate target. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) readily acknowledges the significant enhancementto patient care that CLAD systems can provide. To date, no system has been approved for human use due to alack of appropriate animal models to test adequately the reliability and robustness of these systems. Thereforethe research design of this project will be to conduct in non-human primates neurophysiological recordings (EEG,local field potentials and neural spiking activity) while simultaneously administering anesthetics using acomputer-controlled syringe pump as the animals execute a behavior task to characterize level ofunconsciousness. The data will be analyzed by combining pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic modeling,modern control theory and statistical signal processing approaches to develop and test real-time CLAD systems.The specific aims of this research project are to develop and test in a non-human primate model, CLAD systemsfor real-time control of unconsciousness using the anesthetics: propofol, dexmedetomidine, and propofol anddexmedetomidine administered simultaneously. The broad long-term objectives are to: establish a non-humanprimate model paradigm for development and testing of CLAD systems; and make the use of CLAD systems astandard for intelligent brain state monitoring and precise second-to-second drug dosing in anesthesiology. Thehealth relatedness impact of the research will be a new paradigm for computer-assisted vigilance of brain stateand computer-assisted dosing of anesthetic agents. Such systems should enhance patient safety by reducingprovider errors and by fostering significant decreases in anesthesia-associate brain dysfunction as well as otheranesthesia-related morbidities (inadequate pain control, hypotension, nausea) commonly experienced by themillions of patients who each year receive anesthesia care in operating rooms and intensive care units.

TI  - Artificial intelligence software can generate residency application personal statements that program directors find acceptable and difficult to distinguish from applicant compositions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Study objective: Create personal statements using an artificial intelligence program for anesthesiology residency applications that residency program directors rate as acceptable.Study design: Generate two personal statements and survey program directors.Setting: Anesthesiology residency training programs. Interventions: We instructed ChatGPT, a new artificial-intelligence software program, to generate two 400-word personal statements using the common applicant experiences of involvement in athletics or gourmet cooking. Methods: We sent the generated personal statements to anesthesia program directors and asked them if the statements were acceptable for application to their individual programs, to rate them as poor, good, or excellent, and determine if they could detect anything in the statements that indicated they were not written by an applicant.Measurements: Ninety-four program directors received and opened the survey, and 31 responded. Twenty-eight (90%) responding directors found the personal statement with athletic experience acceptable, with 22 (74%) rating it as good or excellent. Nineteen (61%) program directors did not detect anything in the statement to distinguish it from an applicant-written composition. Twenty-nine (97%) program directors found the personal statement with cooking experience acceptable, with 19 (63%) finding it good or excellent. Twenty-four (80%) directors did not detect anything in the statement to distinguish it from an applicant-written composition.Conclusions: ChatGPT can create personal statements for residency applications that program directors find acceptable and difficult to differentiate from personally crafted statements. Applicants may stop using expensive contractor application services and start using artificial intelligence software to create their personal statements because of its quickness, low cost, and high quality.

TI  - Deep learning via ECG and PPG signals for prediction of depth of anesthesia
T2  - BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - During surgeries, the amount of used anesthetic depends on the physical conditions of the patient and is immensely critical. The conventionally used BIS Quantro machine which measures the Bispectral Index (BIS) level in order to help doctors administer anesthesia, is quite expensive. In this paper, an economic, accurate and state-of-the-art technique is presented to predict the depth of anesthesia (DoA) via advanced deep learning models using 512 Hz Electrocardiogram (ECG) and 128 Hz Photoplethysmography (PPG). The study is conducted based on signal collected from 50 patients acquired during surgery at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). First, heatmaps of the ECG and PPG signals (individual and combined subplots) are generated using MATLAB by filtering 5 s windows to match the frequency of the BIS Quantro Machine which is 0.2 Hz. Then, various deep learning models comprising 5, 6, 8, 10 and 19 layered CNNs are trained using data of 40 patients and tested using the remaining 10 patients. The heatmap images of ECG and PPG are fed as inputs to the CNN models separately and using two input channels. The best accuracy achieved is 86 % which is attained using 10 layered CNN with Tensorflow backend, with combined ECG and PPG heatmaps as inputs. This study uses inexpensive signals, minimum data reconstruction, minimum memory and timing constrains to achieve a decent accuracy, and so it can be used by even small hospitals.

TI  - Relationship between Artificial Intelligence-Based General Anesthetics and Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (Retracted Article)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) refers to the complications of the central nervous system before and after surgery in patients without mental disorders. Many studies have shown that surgical anesthesia may cause POCD, especially in elderly patients. This article aims to study the relationship between artificial intelligence-based general anesthetics and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This article first describes and classifies artificial intelligence, introduces its realization method, machine learning algorithms, and briefly introduces the basic principles of regression and classification methods in machine learning; then, the principles and techniques of general anesthetics are proposed. The pathogenesis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is explained in detail. Finally, the effect of anesthetics on postoperative cognitive dysfunction is obtained from both inhaled anesthetics and intravenous anesthetics. The impact on postoperative cognitive function is explained. The experimental results in this article show that there is no statistically significant difference in the two groups of patients' age, gender ratio, body mass index, education level, preoperative comorbidities, and other general indicators. Through the use of EEG bispectral index monitors to monitor the depth of anesthesia and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, first, there was no obvious relationship between the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction at 1, 5, 10, and 50 days and discharge time. The comprehensive monitoring group can reduce the clinical dose of preventive medication and cis-atracurium and shorten the patient's recovery time, extubation time, and recovery time. In addition, it can also reduce the increase of serum protein S100 beta in elderly patients and reduce the incidence of early postoperative cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - The management of anesthesia is one of the most critical challenges since millions of subjects undergo surgeries every day. For instance, providing an inaccurate drug dose to the patient may entail adverse effects and postoperative complications. In this context, the use of computer-controlled drug dosing systems nowadays available provides significant advantages to effectively regulate anesthesia. This paper presents the control of the depth of hypnosis in anesthesia through a Machine Learning approach, i.e. a Q-learning, that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences. The design and performance evaluation of the proposed solution are done in silico by exploiting an Open-source Patient Simulator, that can describe the main relevant system characteristics.

TI  - Enhanced deep learning algorithm development to detect pain intensity from facial expression images
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated detection of pain intensity from facial expressions, especially from face images that show a patient's health, remains a significant challenge in the medical diagnostics and health informatics area. Expert systems that prudently analyse facial expression images, utilising an automated machine learning algorithm, can be a promising approach for pain intensity analysis in health domain. Deep neural networks and emerging machine learning techniques have made significant progress in both the feature identification, mapping and the modelling of pain intensity from facial images, with great potential to aid health practitioners in the diagnosis of certain medical conditions. Consequently, there has been significant research within the pain recognition and management area that aim to adopt facial expression datasets into deep learning algorithms to detect the pain intensity in binary classes, and also to identify pain and non-pain faces. However, the volume of research in identifying pain intensity levels in multi-classes remains rather limited. This paper reports on a new enhanced deep neural network framework designed for the effective detection of pain intensity, in four-level thresholds using a facial expression image. To explore the robustness of the proposed algorithms, the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Archive Database, comprised of human facial images, was first balanced, then used for the training and testing of the classification model, coupled with the fine-tuned VGG-Face pre-trainer as a feature extraction tool. To reduce the dimensionality of the classification model input data and extract most relevant features, Principal Component Analysis was applied, improving its computational efficiency. The pre-screened features, used as model inputs, are then transferred to produce a new enhanced joint hybrid CNN-BiLSTM (EJH-CNN-BiLSTM) deep learning algorithm comprised of convolutional neural networks, that were then linked to the joint bidirectional LSTM, for multi-classification of pain. The resulting EJH-CNN-BiLSTM classification model, tested to estimate four different levels of pain, revealed a good degree of accuracy in terms of different performance evaluation techniques. The results indicated that the enhanced EJH-CNN-BiLSTM classification algorithm was explored as a potential tool for the detection of pain intensity in multi-classes from facial expression images, and therefore, can be adopted as an artificial intelligence tool in the medical diagnostics for automatic pain detection and subsequent pain management of patients.

TI  - Multiobjective optimization challenges in perioperative anesthesia: A review
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Physicians use perioperative decision-support tools to mitigate risks and maximize benefits to achieve the most successful outcome for patients. Contemporary risk-assessment practices augment surgeons' judgement and experience with decision-support algorithms driven by big data and machine learning. These algorithms accurately assess risk for a wide range of postoperative complications by parsing large datasets and performing complex calculations that would be cumbersome for busy clinicians. Even with these advancements, large gaps in perioperative risk assessment remain; decision-support algorithms often cannot account for risk-reduction therapies applied during a patient's perioperative course and do not quantify tradeoffs between competing goals of care (eg, balancing postoperative pain control with the risk of respiratory depression or balancing intraoperative volume resuscitation with the risk for complications from pulmonary edema). Multiobjective optimization solutions have been applied to similar problems successfully but have not yet been applied to perioperative decision support. Given the large volume of data available via electronic medical records, including intraoperative data, it is now feasible to successfully apply multiobjective optimization in perioperative care. Clinical application of multiobjective optimization would require semiautomated pipelines for analytics and reporting model outputs and a careful development and validation process. Under these circumstances, multiobjective optimization has the potential to support personalized, patient-centered, shared decision-making with precision and balance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - New acoustic monitoring system quantifying aspiration risk during monitored anaesthesia care
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Respiratory monitoring is crucial during monitored anaesthesia care (MAC) to ensure patient safety. Patients undergoing procedures like gastrointestinal endoscopy and dental interventions under MAC have a heightened risk of aspiration. Despite the risks, no current system or device can evaluate aspiration risk. This study presents a novel acoustic monitoring system designed to detect fluid retention in the upper airway during MAC. We conducted a prospective observational study with 60 participants undergoing dental treatment under MAC. We utilized a prototype acoustic monitoring system to assess fluid retention in the upper airway by analysing inspiratory sounds. Water was introduced intraorally in participants to simulate fluid retention; artificial intelligence (AI) analysed respiratory sounds pre and post-injection. We also compared respiratory sounds pre-treatment and during coughing events. Coughing was observed in 14 patients during MAC, and 31 instances of apnoea were detected by capnography. However, 27 of these cases had breath sounds. Notably, with intraoral water injection, the Stridor Quantitative Value (STQV) significantly increased; furthermore, the STQV was substantially higher immediately post-coughing in patients who coughed during MAC. In summary, the innovative acoustic monitoring system using AI provides accurate evaluations of fluid retention in the upper airway, offering potential to mitigate aspiration risks during MAC.

TI  - Accuracy of anesthesia index for monitoring depth of sedation induced by propofol: a comparison with bispectral index
T2  - Chinese Journal of Anesthesiology
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the accuracy of anesthesia index (AI) for monitoring depth of sedation induced by propofol. Methods Thirty patients of both sexes, aged 41-64 yr,with body mass index of 20-30 kg/m~2, of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II,scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia, were enrolled in the study. Propofol was given by target-controlled infusion (TCI) with the initial target effect-site concentration (Ce) of 1.2 g/ml using Marsh pharmacokinetic model, and then the Ce of propofol was increased in 0.3 g/ml increment, and Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score was evaluated. OAA/S score was 5 before TCI of propofol. When OAA/S score reached 4,3,2 and 1 in turn during TCI of propofol, the bispectral index (BIS),AI and corresponding Ce were recorded. Results The correlation coefficients of BIS, AI and Ce levels with the OAA/S scores were r_(BIS-OAA/S)= 0.962,r_(AI-OAA/S) = 0.960 and r_(Ce-OAA/S) = -0.795,respectively (P<0.05). The correlation coefficients of BIS and Al with the Ce of propofol were r_(BIS-Ce) = -0.736 and r_(AI-Ce) = -0.737,respectively (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between r_(BIS-OAA/S) and r_(AI-OAA/S), and between r_(BIS-Ce) and r_(AI-Ce) (P>0.05). Conclusion AI can accurately monitor the depth of sedation induced by propofol in adult patients without noxious stimuli and there is no significant change in the accuracy in comparison with BIS.

AB  - Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder of red blood cells in humans. Complications such as pain, stroke, and organ failure occur in SCD as malformed, sickled red blood cells passing through small blood vessels get trapped. Particularly, acute pain is known to be the primary symptom of SCD. The insidious and subjective nature of SCD pain leads to challenges in pain assessment among Medical Practitioners (MPs). Thus, accurate identification of markers of pain in patients with SCD is crucial for pain management. Classifying clinical notes of patients with SCD based on their pain level enables MPs to give appropriate treatment. We propose a binary classification model to predict pain relevance of clinical notes and a multiclass classification model to predict pain level. While our four binary machine learning (ML) classifiers are comparable in their performance, Decision Trees had the best performance for the multiclass classification task achieving 0.70 in F-measure. Our results show the potential clinical text analysis and machine learning offer to pain management in sickle cell patients.

TI  - Usefulness of new acoustic respiratory sound monitoring with artificial intelligence for upper airway assessment in obese patients during monitored anesthesia care
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) often causes airway complications, particularly posing an elevated risk of aspiration and airway obstruction in obese patients. This study aimed to quantify the levels of aspiration and airway obstruction using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based acoustic analysis algorithm, assessing its utility in identifying airway complications in obese patients. To verify the correlation between the stridor quantitative value (STQV) calculated by acoustic analysis and body weight, and to further evaluate fluid retention and airway obstruction, STQV calculated exhaled breath sounds collected at the neck region, was compared before and after injection of 3 ml of water in the oral cavity and at the start and end of the MAC procedures. STQV measured immediately following the initiation of MAC exhibited a weak correlation with body mass index. Furhtermore, STQV values before and after water injection increased predominantly after injection, further increased at the end of MAC. AI-based analysis of cervical respiratory sounds can enhance the safety of airway management during MAC by quantifying airway obstruction and fluid retention in obese patients.

TI  - Evaluation of the effectiveness of artificial intelligence for ultrasound guided peripheral nerve and plane blocks in recognizing anatomical structures
T2  - ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We aimed to assess the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) based real-time anatomy identification for ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve and plane block in eight regions in this prospective observational study.Methods: After obtaining ethics committee approval and written informed consent from 40 healthy volunteers (20 men and 20 women, between 18 and 72 years old), an ultrasound device installed with AI software (Nerveblox, SmartAlfa, Turkey) were used to scan regions of the cervical plexus, brachial plexus, pectoralis (PECS), rectus sheet, femoralis, canalis adductorius, popliteal, and ESP by three anesthesiology trainees. During scanning by a trainee, once software indicates 100 % scan success of associated anatomic landmarks, both raw and labeled ultrasound images were saved, assessed, and validated using a 6-point scale between 0 and 5 by two expert validators. Evaluation scores of the validators for each block were compared according to demographics (gender, age, and BMI) and block type exists.Results: The scores were not different except ESP, femoralis, and cervical plexus regions between the experts. The mean scores of the experts for the PECS, popliteal and rectus sheath were significant between males and females (p < 0.05). In terms of BMI, significant differences in the scores were observed only in the canalis adductorius, brachial plexus, and ESP regions (p < 0.05).Conclusions: Ultrasound guided AI-based anatomy identification was performed in commonly used eight block regions by the trainees where AI technology can successfully interpret the anatomical structures in real-time sonography which would be valuable in assisting anesthesiologists.

TI  - Opal: an implementation science tool for machine learning clinical decision support in anesthesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Opal is the first published example of a full-stack platform infrastructure for an implementation science designed for ML in anesthesia that solves the problem of leveraging ML for clinical decision support. Users interact with a secure online Opal web application to select a desired operating room (OR) case cohort for data extraction, visualize datasets with built-in graphing techniques, and run in-client ML or extract data for external use. Opal was used to obtain data from 29,004 unique OR cases from a single academic institution for pre-operative prediction of post-operative acute kidney injury (AKI) based on creatinine KDIGO criteria using predictors which included pre-operative demographic, past medical history, medications, and flowsheet information. To demonstrate utility with unsupervised learning, Opal was also used to extract intra-operative flowsheet data from 2995 unique OR cases and patients were clustered using PCA analysis and k-means clustering. A gradient boosting machine model was developed using an 80/20 train to test ratio and yielded an area under the receiver operating curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.85 with 95% CI [0.80-0.90]. At the default probability decision threshold of 0.5, the model sensitivity was 0.9 and the specificity was 0.8. K-means clustering was performed to partition the cases into two clusters and for hypothesis generation of potential groups of outcomes related to intraoperative vitals. Opal's design has created streamlined ML functionality for researchers and clinicians in the perioperative setting and opens the door for many future clinical applications, including data mining, clinical simulation, high-frequency prediction, and quality improvement.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Based Pain Assessment Technology in Clinical Application of Real-World Neonatal Blood Sampling
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Accurate neonatal pain assessment (NPA) is the key to neonatal pain management, yet it is a challenging task for medical staff. This study aimed to analyze the clinical practicability of the artificial intelligence based NPA (AI-NPA) tool for real-world blood sampling. Method: We performed a prospective study to analyze the consistency of the NPA results given by a self-developed automated NPA system and nurses' on-site NPAs (OS-NPAs) for 232 newborns during blood sampling in neonatal wards, where the neonatal infant pain scale (NIPS) was used for evaluation. Spearman correlation analysis and the degree of agreement of the pain score and pain grade derived by the NIPS were applied for statistical analysis. Results: Taking the OS-NPA results as the gold standard, the accuracies of the NIPS pain score and pain grade given by the automated NPA system were 88.79% and 95.25%, with kappa values of 0.92 and 0.90 (p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The results of the automated NPA system for real-world neonatal blood sampling are highly consistent with the results of the OS-NPA. Considering the great advantages of automated NPA systems in repeatability, efficiency, and cost, it is worth popularizing the AI technique in NPA for precise and efficient neonatal pain management.

TI  - Emergency Airway Management Outside the Operating Room: Current Evidence and Management Strategies
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Emergency airway management outside the operating room (OR) is often associated with an increased risk of airway related, as well as cardiopulmonary, complications which can impact morbidity and mortality. These emergent airways may take place in the intensive care unit (ICU), where patients are critically ill with minimal physiological reserve, or other areas of the hospital where advanced equipment and personnel are often unavailable. As such, emergency airway management outside the OR requires expertise at manipulation of not only the anatomically difficult airway but also the physiologically and situationally difficult airway. Adequate preparation and appropriate use of airway management techniques are important to prevent complications. Judicious utilization of pre- and apneic oxygenation is important as is the choice of medications to facilitate intubation in this at-risk population. Recent study in critically ill patients has shown that postintubation hemodynamic and respiratory compromise is common, independently associated with poor outcomes and can be impacted by the choice of drugs and techniques used. In addition to adequately preparing for a physiologically difficult airway, enhancing the ability to predict an anatomically difficult airway is essential in reducing complication rates. The use of artificial intelligence in the identification of difficult airways has shown promising results and could be of significant advantage in uncooperative patients as well as those with a questionable airway examination. Incorporating this technology and understanding the physiological, anatomical, and logistical challenges may help providers better prepare for managing such precarious airways and lead to successful outcomes. This review discusses the various challenges associated with airway management outside the OR, provides guidance on appropriate preparation, airway management skills, medication use, and highlights the role of a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to out-of-OR airway management.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Cambridge, ENGLAND
AB  - Physical rehabilitation is an important part of chronic pain (CP) management. Physiotherapists provide guidance and intervention on the exercises based on the CP patient's affective states. One important clue the physiotherapist uses to understand their patient's affective state is the presence and type of protective movement behavior. As rehabilitation is transferring from clinical settings to home-based environments, technology should provide similar service by automatically detecting the protective behavior exhibited by patients and use it as a cue to inform and adapt the support. Our research focuses on the detection of protective behavior from a deep learning (DL) perspective and using MoCap and EMG data. Based on the knowledge learned from a wider-relevant literature and the specific characteristic of protective behavior, we aim to automatically detect protective behavior with deep learning approaches and further learn its configuration pattern with explainable models. Our initial studies have demonstrated interesting accuracy improvements and also provided important knowledges about the temporal and configurational characteristics of protective behavior.

AB  - Given the risks and cost of hospitalization, there has been significant interest in exploiting machine learning models to improve perioperative care. However, due to the high dimensionality and noisiness of perioperative data, it remains a challenge to develop accurate and robust encoding for surgical predictions. Furthermore, it is important for the encoding to be interpretable by perioperative care practitioners to facilitate their decision making process. We propose clinical variational autoencoder (cVAE), a deep latent variable model that addresses the challenges of surgical applications through two salient features. (1) To overcome performance limitations of traditional VAE, it is prediction-guided with explicit expression of predicted outcome in the latent representation. (2) It disentangles the latent space so that it can be interpreted in a clinically meaningful fashion. We apply cVAE to two real-world perioperative datasets to evaluate its efficacy and performance in predicting outcomes that are important to perioperative care, including postoperative complication and surgery duration. To demonstrate the generality and facilitate reproducibility, we also apply cVAE to the open MIMIC-III dataset for predicting ICU duration and mortality. Our results show that the latent representation provided by cVAE leads to superior performance in classification, regression and multi-task predictions. The two features of cVAE are mutually beneficial and eliminate the need of a predictor. We further demonstrate the interpretability of the disentangled representation and its capability to capture intrinsic characteristics of hospitalized patients. While this work is motivated by and evaluated in the context of clinical applications, the proposed approach may be generalized for other fields using high-dimensional and noisy data and valuing interpretable representations.

M3  - Review
AB  - Chat generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI that answers questions in a human-like manner. ChatGPT is a GPT language model that understands and responds to natural language created using a transformer, which is a new artificial neural network algorithm first introduced by Google in 2017. ChatGPT can be used to identify research topics and proofread English writing and R scripts to improve work efficiency and optimize time. Attempts to actively utilize generative artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to continue in clinical settings. However, ChatGPT still has many limitations for widespread use in clinical research, owing to AI hallucination symptoms and its training data constraints. Researchers recommend avoiding scientific writing using ChatGPT in many traditional journals because of the current lack of originality guidelines and plagiarism of content generated by ChatGPT. Further regulations and discussions on these topics are expected in the future.

TI  - Development of a Super-Resolution Scheme for Pediatric Magnetic Resonance Brain Imaging Through Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pediatric medical imaging represents a real challenge for physicians, as children who are patients often move during the examination, and it causes the appearance of different artifacts in the images. Thus, it is not possible to obtain good quality images for this target population limiting the possibility of evaluation and diagnosis in certain pathological conditions. Specifically, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique that requires long acquisition times and, therefore, demands the use of sedation or general anesthesia to avoid the movement of the patient, which is really damaging in this specific population. Because ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principles should be considered for all imaging studies, one of the most important reasons for establishing novel MRI imaging protocols is to avoid the harmful effects of anesthesia/sedation. In this context, ground-breaking concepts and novel technologies, such as artificial intelligence, can help to find a solution to these challenges while helping in the search for underlying disease mechanisms. The use of new MRI protocols and new image acquisition and/or pre-processing techniques can aid in the development of neuroimaging studies for children evaluation, and their translation to pediatric populations. In this paper, a novel super-resolution method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) in two and three dimensions to automatically increase the resolution of pediatric brain MRI acquired in a reduced time scheme is proposed. Low resolution images have been generated from an original high resolution dataset and used as the input of the CNN, while several scaling factors have been assessed separately. Apart from a healthy dataset, we also tested our model with pathological pediatric MRI, and it successfully recovers the original image quality in both visual and quantitative ways, even for available examples of dysplasia lesions. We hope then to establish the basis for developing an innovative free-sedation protocol in pediatric anatomical MRI acquisition.

TI  - Feasibility of intelligent drug control in the maintenance phase of general anesthesia based on convolutional neural network
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The growth and aging process of the human population has accelerated the increase in surgical procedures. Yet, the demand for increasing operations can be hardly met since the training of anesthesiologists is usually a long-term process. Closed-loop artificial intelligence (AI) model provides the possibility to solve intelligent decision-making for anesthesia auxiliary control and, as such, has allowed breakthroughs in closed-loop control of clinical practices in intensive care units (ICUs). However, applying an open-loop artificial intelligence algorithm to build up personalized medication for anesthesia still needs to be further explored. Currently, anesthesi-ologists have selected doses of intravenously pumped anesthetic drugs mainly based on the blood pressure and bispectral index (BIS), which can express the depth of anesthesia. Unfortunately, BIS cannot be monitored at some medical centers or operational procedures and only be regulated by blood pressure. As a result, here we aim to inaugurally explore the feasibility of a basic intelligent control system applied to drug delivery in the maintenance phase of general anesthesia, based on a convolutional neural network model with open-loop design, according to AI learning of existing anesthesia protocols.Methods: A convolutional neural network, combined with both sliding window sampling method and residual learning module, was utilized to establish an "AI anesthesiologist" model for intra-operative dosing of personalized anesthetic drugs (propofol and remifentanil). The fitting degree and difference in pumping dose decision, between the AI anesthesiologist and the clinical anes-thesiologist, for these personalized anesthetic drugs were examined during the maintenance phase of anesthesia.Results: The medication level established by the "AI anesthesiologist" was comparable to that obtained by the clinical anesthesiologist during the maintenance phase of anesthesia.Conclusion: The application of an open-loop decision-making plan by convolutional neural network showed that intelligent anesthesia control is consistent with the actual anesthesia con-trol, thus providing possibility for further evolution and optimization of auxiliary intelligent control of depth of anesthesia.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning tools have demonstrated viability in visualizing pain accurately using vital sign data; however, it remains uncertain whether incorporating individual patient baselines could enhance accuracy. This study aimed to investigate improving the accuracy by incorporating deviations from baseline patient vital signs and the concurrence of the predicted artificial intelligence values with the probability of critical care pain observation tool (CPOT) >= 3 after fentanyl administration. The study included adult patients in intensive care who underwent multiple pain-related assessments. We employed a random forest model, utilizing arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, gender, age, and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score as explanatory variables. Pain was measured as the probability of CPOT scores of >= 3, and subsequently adjusted based on each patient's baseline. The study included 10,299 patients with 117,190 CPOT assessments. Of these, 3.3% had CPOT scores of >= 3. The random forest model demonstrated strong accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.903. Patients treated with fentanyl were grouped based on CPOT score improvement. Those with >= 1-h of improvement after fentanyl administration had a significantly lower pain index (P = 0.020). Therefore, incorporating deviations from baseline patient vital signs improved the accuracy of pain visualization using machine learning techniques.

TI  - Improving Pain Management in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease from Physiological Measures Using Machine Learning Techniques.
T2  - Smart health (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Pain management is a crucial part in Sickle Cell Disease treatment. Accurate pain assessment is the first stage in pain management. However, pain is a subjective response and hard to assess via objective approaches. In this paper, we proposed a system to map objective physiological measures to subjective self-reported pain scores using machine learning techniques. Using Multinomial Logistic Regression and data from 40 patients, we were able to predict patients' pain scores on an 11-point rating scale with an average accuracy of 0.578 at the intra-individual level, and an accuracy of 0.429 at the inter-individual level. With a condensed 4-point rating scale, the accuracy at the inter-individual level was further improved to 0.681. Overall, we presented a preliminary machine learning model that can predict pain scores in SCD patients with promising results. To our knowledge, such a system has not been proposed earlier within the SCD or pain domains by exploiting machine learning concepts within the clinical framework.

TI  - Intelligent monitoring of noxious stimulation during anaesthesia based on heart rate variability analysis
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Research based on medical signals has received significant attention in recent years. If the patients' states can be accurately monitored based on medical signals, it greatly benefits both doctors and patients. This paper proposes a method to extract signal features from heart rate variability signals and classify patients' states using the long short-term memory network and enable effective monitoring of noxious stimulation. For data processing, the heart rate variability signal is decomposed and recombined by the empirical mode decomposition method, and the signal features of the noxious stimulation are extracted by the sliding time window method. Compared with the average accuracy of direct classifications, the classification accuracy based on the proposed method is proved more accurate. The model based on the extracted features proposed can realize the classification of consciousness and general anaesthesia with an accuracy rate of more than 90% and accurately estimate the occurrence of tracheal intubation stimulation. Furthermore, this study shows that combining the deep learning neural network with the extracted more effective signal features under different states and stresses can classify the states with high accuracy. Therefore, it is promising to apply the deep learning method in researching the autonomic nervous system.

TI  - Machine Learning in Chronic Pain Research: A Scoping Review
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Given the high prevalence and associated cost of chronic pain, it has a significant impact on individuals and society. Improvements in the treatment and management of chronic pain may increase patients' quality of life and reduce societal costs. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in chronic pain research. A literature search was conducted using the PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library databases. Relevant studies were identified by screening titles and abstracts for keywords related to chronic pain and machine learning, followed by analysing full texts. Two hundred and eighty-seven publications were identified in the literature search. In total, fifty-three papers on chronic pain research and machine learning were reviewed. The review showed that while many studies have emphasised machine learning-based classification for the diagnosis of chronic pain, far less attention has been paid to the treatment and management of chronic pain. More research is needed on machine learning approaches to the treatment, rehabilitation, and self-management of chronic pain. As with other chronic conditions, patient involvement and self-management are crucial. In order to achieve this, patients with chronic pain need digital tools that can help them make decisions about their own treatment and care.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation mimics non-rapid eye movement stage 3 sleep: large-scale validation using machine learning
T2  - SLEEP
M3  - Article
AB  - Study objectives: Dexmedetomidine-induced electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns during deep sedation are comparable with natural sleep patterns. Using large-scale EEG recordings and machine learning techniques, we investigated whether dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation indeed mimics natural sleep patterns.Methods: We used EEG recordings from three sources in this study: 8,707 overnight sleep EEG and 30 dexmedetomidine clinical trial EEG. Dexmedetomidine-induced sedation levels were assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score. We extracted 22 spectral features from each EEG recording using a multitaper spectral estimation method. Elastic-net regularization method was used for feature selection. We compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest), trained on individual sleep stages, to predict different levels of the MOAA/S sedation state.Results: The random forest algorithm trained on non-rapid eye movement stage 3 (N3) predicted dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation (MOAA/S = 0) with area under the receiver operator characteristics curve >0.8 outperforming other machine learning models. Power in the delta band (0-4 Hz) was selected as an important feature for prediction in addition to power in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (16-30 Hz) bands.Conclusions: Using a large-scale EEG data-driven approach and machine learning framework, we show that dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation state mimics N3 sleep EEG patterns.

TI  - Envisioning gamification in anesthesia, pain management, and critical care: basic principles, integration of artificial intelligence, and simulation strategies.
T2  - Journal of anesthesia, analgesia and critical care
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Unlike traditional video games developed solely for entertainment purposes, game-based learning employs intentionally crafted approaches that seamlessly merge entertainment and educational content, resulting in captivating and effective learning encounters. These pedagogical methods include serious video games and gamification. Serious games are video games utilized as tools for acquiring crucial (serious) knowledge and skills. On the other hand, gamification requires integrating gaming elements (game mechanics) such as points, leaderboards, missions, levels, rewards, and more, into a context that may not be associated with video gaming activities. They can be dynamically (game dynamics) combined developing various strategic approaches. Operatively, gamification adopts simulation elements and leverages the interactive nature of gaming to teach players specific skills, convey knowledge, or address real-world issues. External incentives stimulate internal motivation. Therefore, these techniques place the learners in the central role, allowing them to actively construct knowledge through firsthand experiences.Anesthesia, pain medicine, and critical care demand a delicate interplay of technical competence and non-technical proficiencies. Gamification techniques can offer advantages to both domains. Game-based modalities provide a dynamic, interactive, and highly effective opportunity to learn, practice, and improve both technical and non-technical skills, enriching the overall proficiency of anesthesia professionals. These properties are crucial in a discipline where personal skills, human factors, and the influence of stressors significantly impact daily work activities. Furthermore, gamification can also be embraced for patient education to enhance comfort and compliance, particularly within pediatric settings (game-based distraction), and in pain medicine through stress management techniques. On these bases, the creation of effective gamification tools for anesthesiologists can present a formidable opportunity for users and developers.This narrative review comprehensively examines the intricate aspects of gamification and its potentially transformative influence on the fields of anesthesiology. It delves into theoretical frameworks, potential advantages in education and training, integration with artificial intelligence systems and immersive techniques, and also addresses the challenges that could arise within these contexts.

TI  - Objectively measuring pain using facial expression: is the technology finally ready?
T2  - Pain management
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Currently, clinicians observe pain-related behaviors and use patient self-report measures in order to determine pain severity. This paper reviews the evidence when facial expression is used as a measure of pain. We review the literature reporting the relevance of facial expression as a diagnostic measure, which facial movements are indicative of pain, and whether such movements can be reliably used to measure pain. We conclude that although the technology for objective pain measurement is not yet ready for use in clinical settings, the potential benefits to patients in improved pain management, combined with the advances being made in sensor technology and artificial intelligence, provide opportunities for research and innovation.

T2  - COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objective: The automatic assessment of pain is vital in designing optimal pain manage-ment interventions focused on reducing suffering and preventing the functional decline of patients. In recent years, there has been a surge in the adoption of deep learning algorithms by researchers attempt-ing to encode the multidimensional nature of pain into meaningful features. This systematic review aims to discuss the models, the methods, and the types of data employed in establishing the foundation of a deep learning-based automatic pain assessment system.Methods: The systematic review was conducted by identifying original studies searching digital libraries, namely Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to retrieve and select those of interest, published until December 2021.Results: A total of one hundred and ten publications were identified and categorized by the number of in-formation channels used (unimodal versus multimodal approaches) and whether the temporal dimension was also used.Conclusions: This review demonstrates the importance of multimodal approaches for automatic pain esti-mation, especially in clinical settings, and also reveals that significant improvements are observed when the temporal exploitation of modalities is included. It provides suggestions regarding better-performing deep architectures and learning methods. Also, it provides suggestions for adopting robust evaluation protocols and interpretation methods to provide objective and comprehensible results. Furthermore, the review presents the limitations of the available pain databases for optimally supporting deep learning modet development, validation, and application as decision-support tools in real-life scenarioa.(R) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - The Clinical Researcher Journey in the Artificial Intelligence Era: The PAC-MAN's Challenge
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that can assist researchers and clinicians in various settings. However, like any technology, it must be used with caution and awareness as there are numerous potential pitfalls. To provide a creative analogy, we have likened research to the PAC-MAN classic arcade video game. Just as the protagonist of the game is constantly seeking data, researchers are constantly seeking information that must be acquired and managed within the constraints of the research rules. In our analogy, the obstacles that researchers face are represented by "ghosts", which symbolize major ethical concerns, low-quality data, legal issues, and educational challenges. In short, clinical researchers need to meticulously collect and analyze data from various sources, often navigating through intricate and nuanced challenges to ensure that the data they obtain are both precise and pertinent to their research inquiry. Reflecting on this analogy can foster a deeper comprehension of the significance of employing AI and other powerful technologies with heightened awareness and attentiveness.

TI  - Virtual Reality meets Artificial Intelligence: The Emergence of Advanced Digital Therapeutics and Digital Biomarkers
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF CYBERTHERAPY AND TELEMEDICINE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - In the past 25 years, researchers have discovered that Virtual Reality (VR) is an effective tool for mental health treatment and assessment in anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. Moreover, VR is also an effective assessment tool with practical applications that range from social and cognitive deficits to addiction. Nevertheless, despite progress, evidence-based psychological treatments still need improvement. In this paper we suggest that the integration of VR with another emerging technology - Artificial Intelligence (AI) - will provide clinicians with two new powerful tools for improving evidence-based psychological treatments: advanced digital therapeutics and digital biomarkers. The term "Digital Therapeutics" indicates the use of digital/online health technologies to treat a medical or psychological condition. Following this definition, any VR clinical application can be defined as a form of digital therapeutics. However, the integration between VR al AI allows a critical feature for any digital therapeutic: personalization. On one side, VR allows the collection of "Digital Biomarkers" - physiological, and behavioral data that are collected by means of digital technologies and used as an indicator of biologic processes or biological responses to therapeutic interventions - that are directly connected to the brain functioning and can be altered to correct the specific dysfunctions of the predictive coding mechanisms in the individual's brain. On the other side AI, by applying machine learning techniques to the individual's digital biomarkers, allows the optimization the individual treatment strategy facilitating the transition to a personalized, effective and engaging medicine.Y

AB  - General anesthesia is now an important part of surgery, it can ensure that patients undergo surgery in a painless and unconscious state. The traditional anesthesia depth assessment mainly relies on the subjective judgment of the anesthesiologist, lacks a unified standard, and is prone to misjudgment. Since general anesthesia is essentially anesthesia of the central nervous system, the state of anesthesia can be monitored based on EEG analysis. Based on this, this paper proposes a method to reasonably construct a brain connection network system based on the characteristic parameters of EEG signals and combine machine learning to evaluate the state of anesthesia. This method extracts the EEG signals related to the depth of anesthesia, The knowledge of graph theory introduces the three functional indicators of Pearson correlation coefficient, phase-lock value and phase lag index to construct a complex brain network, and then perform feature selection based on the constructed brain network to generate a dataset, and use machine learning methods for classification. To evaluate the anesthesia state, the experimental results show that the accuracy of the method for evaluating the anesthesia state can reach 93.88%.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose We aimed to improve OR efficiency using machine learning (ML) to find relevant metrics influencing surgery time success and team performance on efficiency to create a model which incorporated team, patient, and surgery-related factors. Methods From 2012 to 2020, five surgeons, 44 nurses, and 152 anesthesiologists participated in 1199 four joint days (4796 cases): 1461 THA, 1496 TKA, 652 HR, 242 UKA, and 945 others. Patients were 2461f:2335 m; age, 64.1; BMI, 29.93; and ASA, 2.45. Surgical Success was defined as completing four joints within an eight hour shift using one OR. Time data was recorded prospectively using Surgical Information Management Systems. Hospital records provided team, patient demographics, adverse events, and anesthetic. Data mining identified patterns and relationships in higher dimensions. Predictive analytics used ML ranking algorithm to identify important metrics and created decision tree models for benchmarks and success probability. Results Five variables predicted success: anaesthesia preparation time, surgical preparation time, time of procedure, anesthesia finish time, and type of joint replacement. The model determined success rate with accuracy of 72% and AUC = 0.72. Probability of success based on mean performance was 77-89% (mean-median) if APT 14-15 minutes, PT 68-70 minutes, AFT four to five minutes, and turnover 25-27 minutes. With the above benchmarks maintained, success rate was 59% if surgeon exceeded 71.5-minutes PT or 89% if 64-minutes procedure time or 66% when anesthesiologist spent 17-19.5 minutes on APT. Conclusion AI-ML predicted OR success without increasing resources. Benchmarks track OR performance, demonstrate effects of strategic changes, guide decisions, and provide teamwork improvement opportunities.

TI  - Semi-automated tracking of pain in critical care patients using artificial intelligence: a retrospective observational study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the pain intensity in critically ill patients is crucial because intense pain can cause adverse events, including poor survival rates; however, continuous pain evaluation is difficult. Vital signs have traditionally been considered ineffective in pain assessment; nevertheless, the use of machine learning may automate pain assessment using vital signs. This retrospective observational study was performed at a university hospital in Sendai, Japan. Objective pain assessments were performed in eligible patients using the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT). Three machine-learning methods-random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR)-were employed to predict pain using parameters, such as vital signs, age group, and sedation levels. Prediction accuracy was calculated as the harmonic mean of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Furthermore, 117,190 CPOT assessments were performed in 11,507 eligible patients (median age: 65 years; 58.0% males). We found that pain prediction was possible with all three machine-learning methods. RF demonstrated the highest AUROC for the test data (RF: 0.853, SVM: 0.823, and LR: 0.787). With this method, pain can be objectively, continuously, and semi-automatically evaluated in critically ill patients.

AB  - Introduction: Perioperative morbidity is a public health priority, and surgical volume is increasing rapidly. With advances in technology, there is an opportunity to research the utility of a telemedicine-based control center for anesthesia clinicians that assess risk, diagnoses negative patient trajectories, and implements evidence-based practices. Objectives: The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether an anesthesiology control tower (ACT) prevents clinically relevant adverse postoperative outcomes including 30-day mortality, delirium, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. Secondary objectives are to determine whether the ACT improves perioperative quality of care metrics including management of temperature, mean arterial pressure, mean airway pressure with mechanical ventilation, blood glucose, anesthetic concentration, antibiotic redosing, and efficient fresh gas flow. Methods and analysis: We are conducting a single center, randomized, controlled, phase 3 pragmatic clinical trial. A total of 58 operating rooms are randomized daily to receive support from the ACT or not. All adults (eighteen years and older) undergoing surgical procedures in these operating rooms are included and followed until 30 days after their surgery. Clinicians in operating rooms randomized to ACT support receive decision support from clinicians in the ACT. In operating rooms randomized to no intervention, the current standard of anesthesia care is delivered. The intention-to-treat principle will be followed for all analyses. Differences between groups will be presented with 99% confidence intervals; p-values <0.005 will be reported as providing compelling evidence, and p-values between 0.05 and 0.005 will be reported as providing suggestive evidence. Registration: TECTONICS is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03923699; registered on 23 April 2019.

TI  - Medical Informatics Operating Room Vitals and Events Repository (MOVER): a public-access operating room database
T2  - JAMIA OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming the healthcare industry. However, despite its potential, AI is yet to see widespread deployment in clinical settings in significant part due to the lack of publicly available clinical data and the lack of transparency in the published AI algorithms. There are few clinical data repositories publicly accessible to researchers to train and test AI algorithms, and even fewer that contain specialized data from the perioperative setting. To address this gap, we present and release the Medical Informatics Operating Room Vitals and Events Repository (MOVER).Materials and Methods This first release of MOVER includes adult patients who underwent surgery at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center from 2015 to 2022. Data for patients who underwent surgery were captured from 2 different sources: High-fidelity physiological waveforms from all of the operating rooms were captured in real time and matched with electronic medical record data.Results MOVER includes data from 58 799 unique patients and 83 468 surgeries. MOVER is available for download at https://doi.org/10.24432/C5VS5G, it can be downloaded by anyone who signs a data usage agreement (DUA), to restrict traffic to legitimate researchers.Discussion To the best of our knowledge MOVER is the only freely available public data repository that contains electronic health record and high-fidelity physiological waveforms data for patients undergoing surgery.Conclusion MOVER is freely available to all researchers who sign a DUA, and we hope that it will accelerate the integration of AI into healthcare settings, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.Despite many publications showing artificial intelligence algorithms to be successful in retrospective healthcare studies, there is a very limited amount of freely and publicly available medical data for researchers to work with, to develop and benchmark predictive and other methods in a reproducible manner. This is even more significant in the perioperative setting for patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia. In this article, we present and release a new repository we have constructed called MOVER: Medical Informatics Operating Room Vitals and Events Repository. This repository contains data (electronic medical record data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms data obtained from the bedside physiological monitors) associated with hospital visits for patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia. MOVER is freely available for download for all researchers who sign a data usage agreement: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5VS5G. MOVER is intended to advance a wide variety of healthcare research and serve as a resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms.

TI  - Potential EEG biomarkers of sedation doses in intensive care patients unveiled by using a machine learning approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Sedation of neurocritically ill patients is one of the most challenging situation in ICUs. Quantitative knowledge on the sedation effect on brain activity in that complex scenario could help to uncover new markers for sedation assessment. Hence, we aim to evaluate the existence of changes of diverse EEG-derived measures in deeply-sedated (BASS-Richmond agitation-sedation scale -4 and -5) neurocritically ill patients, and also whether sedation doses are related with those eventual changes. Approach. We performed an observational prospective cohort study in the intensive care unit of the Hospital de la Princesa. Twenty-six adult patients suffered from traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage were included in the present study. Long-term continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings (2141h) and hourly annotated information were used to determine the relationship between intravenous sedation infusion doses and network and spectral EEG measures. To do that, two different strategies were followed: assessment of the statistical dependence between both variables using the Spearman correlation rank and by performing an automatic classification method based on a machine learning algorithm. Main results. More than 60% of patients presented a correlation greater than 0.5 in at least one of the calculated EEG measures with the sedation dose. The automatic classification method presented an accuracy of 84.3% in discriminating between different sedation doses. In both cases the nodes' degree was the most relevant measurement. Significance. The results presented here provide evidences of brain activity changes during deep sedation linked to sedation doses. Particularly, the capability of network EEG-derived measures in discriminating between different sedation doses could be the framework for the development of accurate methods for sedation levels assessment.

AB  - Measuring pain objectively, namely, based on physiological signals instead of self-reported measures, would be highly valuable for better treating people with chronic pain. The subjectivity of the gold standard to quantify pain, which is based upon subjects' self-reported assessment using numerical or visual scales, makes pain management extremely complicated and, in many cases, has led to abuse of pain medication. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a highly sensitive measure of sympathetic activity and has been increasingly used to objectively assess pain. In this study, we evaluated convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures for the task of detecting pain continuously. Additionally, we tested the use of the time-frequency spectrum of the phasic component of the electrodermal activity, as feature for this task. We used a merged database composed of thirty-six healthy subjects that underwent heat pain stimuli by means of a thermal grill. The LSTM models obtained better performance than the CNN ones by more of 3% in the F1-Score. Moreover, the best performance was achieved by a stacked bi- and uni-directional LSTM architecture, with 75.3% F1-Score, being able to accurately detect the onset and end of the pain response on EDA. Continuous objective pain detection using deep learning can contribute to continuous monitoring pain sensation and to reduce the consequences of subjectiveness of current pain assessment methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - Classifying the patient's depth of anesthesia (LoH) level into a few distinct states may lead to inappropriate drug administration. To tackle the problem, this paper presents a robust and computationally efficient framework that predicts a continuous LoH index scale from 0-100 in addition to the LoH state. This paper proposes a novel approach for accurate LoH estimation based on Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and fractal features. The deep learning model adopts an optimized temporal, fractal, and spectral feature set to identify the patient sedation level irrespective of age and the type of anesthetic agent. This feature set is then fed into a multilayer perceptron network (MLP), a class of feed-forward neural networks. A comparative analysis of regression and classification is made to measure the performance of the chosen features on the neural network architecture. The proposed LoH classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art LoH prediction algorithms with the highest accuracy of 97.1% while utilizing minimized feature set and MLP classifier. Moreover, for the first time, the LoH regressor achieves the highest performance metrics (R-2 = 0.9, MAE = 1.5) as compared to previous work. This study is very helpful for developing highly accurate monitoring for LoH which is important for intraoperative and postoperative patients' health.

TI  - The use of a machine-learning algorithm that predicts hypotension during surgery in combination with personalized treatment guidance: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial
T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Intraoperative hypotension is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Current treatment is mostly reactive. The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) algorithm is able to predict hypotension minutes before the blood pressure actually decreases. Internal and external validation of this algorithm has shown good sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that the use of this algorithm in combination with a personalized treatment protocol will reduce the time weighted average (TWA) in hypotension during surgery spent in hypotension intraoperatively.Methods/design: We aim to include 100 adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery with an anticipated duration of more than 2 h, necessitating the use of an arterial line, and an intraoperatively targeted mean arterial pressure (MAP) of > 65 mmHg. This study is divided into two parts; in phase A baseline TWA data from 40 patients will be collected prospectively. A device (HemoSphere) with HPI software will be connected but fully covered. Phase B is designed as a single-center, randomized controlled trial were 60 patients will be randomized with computer-generated blocks of four, six or eight, with an allocation ratio of 1:1. In the intervention arm the HemoSphere with HPI will be used to guide treatment; in the control arm the HemoSphere with HPI software will be connected but fully covered. The primary outcome is the TWA in hypotension during surgery.Discussion: The aim of this trial is to explore whether the use of a machine-learning algorithm intraoperatively can result in less hypotension. To test this, the treating anesthesiologist will need to change treatment behavior from reactive to proactive.

TI  - Machine learning in perioperative medicine: a systematic review.
T2  - Journal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care (Online)
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk stratification plays a central role in anesthetic evaluation. The use of Big Data and machine learning (ML) offers considerable advantages for collection and evaluation of large amounts of complex health-care data. We conducted a systematic review to understand the role of ML in the development of predictive post-surgical outcome models and risk stratification.METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we selected the period of the research for studies from 1 January 2015 up to 30 March 2021. A systematic search in Scopus, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and MeSH databases was performed; the strings of research included different combinations of keywords: "risk prediction," "surgery," "machine learning," "intensive care unit (ICU)," and "anesthesia" "perioperative." We identified 36 eligible studies. This study evaluates the quality of reporting of prediction models using the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist.RESULTS: The most considered outcomes were mortality risk, systemic complications (pulmonary, cardiovascular, acute kidney injury (AKI), etc.), ICU admission, anesthesiologic risk and prolonged length of hospital stay. Not all the study completely followed the TRIPOD checklist, but the quality was overall acceptable with 75% of studies (Rev #2, comm #minor issue) showing an adherence rate to TRIPOD more than 60%. The most frequently used algorithms were gradient boosting (n = 13), random forest (n = 10), logistic regression (LR; n = 7), artificial neural networks (ANNs; n = 6), and support vector machines (SVM; n = 6). Models with best performance were random forest and gradient boosting, with AUC > 0.90.CONCLUSIONS: The application of ML in medicine appears to have a great potential. From our analysis, depending on the input features considered and on the specific prediction task, ML algorithms seem effective in outcomes prediction more accurately than validated prognostic scores and traditional statistics. Thus, our review encourages the healthcare domain and artificial intelligence (AI) developers to adopt an interdisciplinary and systemic approach to evaluate the overall impact of AI on perioperative risk assessment and on further health care settings as well.

TI  - Is a Fundamental Design Change for Gastrointestinal Endoscopes Required?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Since the first fiberoptic instruments, gastrointestinal endoscopy has shaped the field of gastroenterology and is now a key diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Compared with the initial fiberoptic endoscopes state-of-the-art optical chips (or charge-coupled device technology) allowed a quantum leap in image quality. Despite these advances, gastrointestinal endoscopy is far from being perfect. The diagnostic yield (eg, for adenoma detection rates) is highly operator dependent and there is still the need for sedation or even anesthesia to address discomfort during the procedure. Despite highly standardized cleaning and high-level disinfection the reuse of contemporary (and difficult to clean) endoscopes with multiple channels exposes patients to the risk of transmission of infections. Artificial intelligence and pattern recognition should eliminate interindividual variability including polyp detection rates, self-propelled, and (potentially remotely controlled) scopes with a soft shaft could reduce the discomfort during procedures and abolish the need for sedation and anesthesia altogether and single-use designs should eliminate the risk of patient-to-patient transmission of infections. While these innovations are feasible and could be implemented rapidly utilizing available technology, they require a paradigm shift affecting all levels of the value chain from the supplier of the instruments to the end-users. Some may negate the need for a paradigm shift, but it is evident that a major redesign of the endoscopic equipment is overdue to fully utilize novel technologies and most importantly ensure the best possible outcomes for patients.

TI  - Multi-Phases and Various Feature Extraction and Selection Methodology for Ensemble Gradient Boosting in Estimating Respiratory Rate
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the correct respiratory rate (RR) is an essential technique for intensive care units, hospitals, geriatric hospital facilities, and home care services. Capnography is a standard methodology used to monitor carbon dioxide concentrations or partial pressures of respiratory gases to provide the most accurate RR measurements. However, it is inconvenient to use and has been primarily used while administering anesthesia and during intensive care. Many researchers now use electrocardiogram signals to estimate RR. Despite the recent developments, the current hospital environments suffer from inaccurate respiratory monitoring. While various machine learning techniques, including deep learning, have recently been applied to the medical processing sector, only a few studies have been conducted in the field of RR estimation. Therefore, using photoplethysmography, machine-learning techniques such as the ensemble gradient boosting algorithm are being employed in RR estimation. Multi-phases are used based on various feature extraction and selection methodology to improve the performance for RR estimation. In this study, the number of ensembles is increased, and the proposed ensemble methodology is effectively learned to estimate the RR. The proposed ensemble-based gradient boosting algorithm are compared with those of ensemble-based long-short memory network, and ensemble-based supported vector regression techniques, 3.30 breaths per min (bpm), 4.82 bpm and 5.83 bpm based on mean absolute errors. The proposed method shows a more accurate estimate of the respiration rate.

TI  - eXplainable Artificial intelligence and VIrtual reality for Enhanced Radiology
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) technologies have made great strides in equalling and even surpassing human performance in many tasks, particularly in healthcare. Although DL cannot replace clinicians in medical diagnosis, it can support expert radiologists in performing time-consuming tasks, such as examining chest X-rays for signs of pneumonia. Despite this success, the internal mechanisms of these technologies are an enigma because humans cannot scrutinize how these systems do what they do. This uncertainty poses a significant concern in adopting AI-based technologies in healthcare because they are highly susceptible to biases due to the computation of spurious correlations during the prediction process which can put human lives in danger. Alternative technologies are needed to promote user trust. This research project aims to make DL models understandable to radiologists by promoting Virtual Reality (VR) as a disruptive technology for clinical practice in assessing chest X-ray images. Indeed, present-day virtual reality techniques allow healthcare professionals and patients to interact with a simulated environment for medical education (including simulated surgical training), pain management, or rehabilitation. The global healthcare VR market will reach $ 2.2 billion by 2024. Indeed, according to Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, health care is among the top three significant adopters of VR technology until 2025 (https://www.scnsoft.com/virtual-reality/healthcare).XAVIER will combine VR technologies with existing chest X-ray databases to create, collect, and validate the first COVID-19 dataset in the scientific literature consisting of eye-tracking data and pupil dilations together with radiologists' manual image annotations and audio readings. This dataset will be the foundation to create a novel human-centered multimodal DL architecture that can learn from human classification patterns using radiologists' eye-tracking data and pupil dilations. Ultimately, this project will contribute (1) with a novel public multimodal and annotated chest Xray dataset that can provide novel research advancements on COVID-19 and related diseases; (2) to promote VR technologies for clinical practice in assessing chest X-ray medical images by proposing a certification to the European Medicament Agency; and (3)  to teach machines how radiologists diagnose X-ray images and to use that knowledge to generate explanations and promote trust in the adoption of AI-based systems, leading to a more accurate, augmented, and enhanced decision-making process in clinical practice. One important byproduct of this project will be (4) novel computer-assisted training for young radiologist and imagiology students, thanks to enhanced dialogues.

T2  - 35TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION NETWORKING (ICOIN 2021)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 35th International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Total intravenous anesthesia using propofol and remifentanil is widely used. However, a rapid elimination property of the control of the drug infusion rate leads to problems. Recently, it has been shown that machine learning algorithms are able to more accurately predict drug effects than traditional prediction models. Based on this trend, this paper proposes a machine learning method that can simulate the transition dynamics of patient data during anesthesia to configure the interactive environment. In addition, we propose deep reinforcement learning with behavior cloning-based initialization to train the propofol and remifentanil control policies. As shown in the data-intensive performance evaluation, the proposed method achieves a desirable performance in terms of average bispectral index and blood pressure during the surgery simulation.

TI  - A Pilot Study Implementing a Machine Learning Algorithm to Use Artificial Intelligence to Diagnose Spinal Conditions
T2  - PAIN PHYSICIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chronic spinal pain is the most prevalent chronic disease, with chronic persistent spinal pain lasting longer than one-year reported in 25% to 60% of the patients. Health care expenditures have been escalating and the financial impact on the US economy is growing. Among multiple modalities of treatments available, facet joint interventions and epidural interventions are the most common ones, in addition to surgical interventions and numerous other conservative modalities of treatments. Despite these increasing costs in the diagnosis and management, disability continues to increase.Consequently, algorithmic approaches have been described as providing a disciplined approach to the use of spinal interventional techniques in managing spinal pain. This approach includes evaluative, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches, which avoids unnecessary care, as well as poorly documented practices.Recently, techniques involving artificial intelligence and machine learning have been demonstrated to contribute to the improved understanding, diagnosis, and management of both acute and chronic disease in line with well-designed algorithmic approach. The use of artificial intelligence and machinelearning techniques for the diagnosis of spinal pain has not been widely investigated or adopted.Objectives: To evaluate whether it is possible to use artificial intelligence via machine learning algorithms to analyze specific data points and to predict the most likely diagnosis related to spinal pain.Study Design: This was a prospective, observational pilot study.Setting: A single pain management center in the United States.Methods: A total of 246 consecutive patients with spinal pain were enrolled. Patients were given an iPad to complete a Google form with 85 specific data points, including demographic information, type of pain, pain score, pain location, pain duration, and functional status scores. The data were then input into a decision tree machine learning software program that attempted to learn which data points were most likely to correspond to the practitioner-assigned diagnosis. These outcomes were then compared with the practitioner-assigned diagnosis in the chart.Results: The average age of the included patients was 57.4 years (range, 18-91 years). The majority of patients were women and the average pain history was approximately 2 years. The most common practitioner-assigned diagnoses included lumbar radiculopathy and lumbar facet disease/spondylosis. Comparison of the software-predicted diagnosis based on reported symptoms with practitioner-assigned diagnosis revealed that the software was accurate approximately 72% of the time.Limitations: Additional studies are needed to expand the data set, confirm the predictive ability of the data set, and determine whether it is broadly applicable across pain practices.Conclusions: Software-predicted diagnoses based on the data from patients with spinal pain had an accuracy rate of 72%, suggesting promise for augmented decision making using artificial intelligence in this setting.

TI  - ORIENTATE: automated machine learning classifiers for oral health prediction and research
T2  - BMC ORAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe application of data-driven methods is expected to play an increasingly important role in healthcare. However, a lack of personnel with the necessary skills to develop these models and interpret its output is preventing a wider adoption of these methods. To address this gap, we introduce and describe ORIENTATE, a software for automated application of machine learning classification algorithms by clinical practitioners lacking specific technical skills. ORIENTATE allows the selection of features and the target variable, then automatically generates a number of classification models and cross-validates them, finding the best model and evaluating it. It also implements a custom feature selection algorithm for systematic searches of the best combination of predictors for a given target variable. Finally, it outputs a comprehensive report with graphs that facilitates the explanation of the classification model results, using global interpretation methods, and an interface for the prediction of new input samples. Feature relevance and interaction plots provided by ORIENTATE allow to use it for statistical inference, which can replace and/or complement classical statistical studies.ResultsIts application to a dataset with healthy and special health care needs (SHCN) children, treated under deep sedation, was discussed as case study. On the example dataset, despite its small size, the feature selection algorithm found a set of features able to predict the need for a second sedation with a f1 score of 0.83 and a ROC (AUC) of 0.92. Eight predictive factors for both populations were found and ordered by the relevance assigned to them by the model. A discussion of how to derive inferences from the relevance and interaction plots and a comparison with a classical study is also provided.ConclusionsORIENTATE automatically finds suitable features and generates accurate classifiers which can be used in preventive tasks. In addition, researchers without specific skills on data methods can use it for the application of machine learning classification and as a complement to classical studies for inferential analysis of features. In the case study, a high prediction accuracy for a second sedation in SHCN children was achieved. The analysis of the relevance of the features showed that the number of teeth with pulpar treatments at the first sedation is a predictive factor for a second sedation.

TI  - Study on miR-384-5p activates TGF-β signaling pathway to promote neuronal damage in abutment nucleus of rats based on deep learning
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Any ailment in our organs can be visualized by using different modality signals and images. Hospitals are encountering a massive influx of large multimodality patient data to be analysed accurately and with context understanding. The deep learning techniques, like convolution neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoencoders, deep generative models and deep belief networks have already been applied to efficiently analyse possible large collections of data. Application of these methods to medical signals and images can aid the clinicians in clinical decision making.Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore its potential application mechanism to the abalone basal ganglia neurons in rats based on deep learning.Patients and methods: Firstly, in the GEO database, we obtained data on rat anesthesia, performing differential analysis, co-expression analysis, and enrichment analysis, and then we received the relevant module genes. Besides, the potential regulation of multi-factors on the module was calculated by hypergeometric test, and a series of ncRNA and TF were identified. Finally, we screened the target genes of anesthetized rats to gain insight into the potential role of anesthesia in rat basal lateral nucleus neurons.Results: A total of 535 differentially expressed genes in rats were obtained, involving Mafb and Ryr2. These genes are clustered into 17 anesthesia-related expression disorder modules. At the same time, the biological processes favored by the module are regulation of neuron apoptotic process and transforming growth factor beta2 production. Pivot analysis found that 39 ncRNAs and 4 TFs drive anesthesia-related disorders. Finally, the mechanism of action was analyzed and predicted. The module was regulated by Acvr1. We believe that miR-384-5p in anesthetized rats can activate the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Further, it promotes anesthesia and causes exposure to the basal ganglia neuron damage of the amygdala.Conclusion: In this study, the imbalance module was used to explore the multi-factor-mediated anesthesia application mechanism, which provided new methods and ideas for subsequent research. The results suggest that miR-384-5p can promote anesthesia damage to the abalone basal ganglia neurons in rats through a variety of biological processes and signaling pathways. This result lays a solid theoretical foundation for biologists to explore the application mechanism of anesthesiology further.

TI  - Classification of Current Procedural Terminology Codes from Electronic Health Record Data Using Machine Learning
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Accurate anesthesiology procedure code data are essential to quality improvement, research, and reimbursement tasks within anesthesiology practices. Advanced data science techniques, including machine learning and natural language processing, offer opportunities to develop classification tools for Current Procedural Terminology codes across anesthesia procedures.Methods:Models were created using a Train/Test dataset including 1,164,343 procedures from 16 academic and private hospitals. Five supervised machine learning models were created to classify anesthesiology Current Procedural Terminology codes, with accuracy defined as first choice classification matching the institutional-assigned code existing in the perioperative database. The two best performing models were further refined and tested on a Holdout dataset from a single institution distinct from Train/Test. A tunable confidence parameter was created to identify cases for which models were highly accurate, with the goal of at least 95% accuracy, above the reported 2018 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Baltimore, Maryland) fee-for-service accuracy. Actual submitted claim data from billing specialists were used as a reference standard.Results:Support vector machine and neural network label-embedding attentive models were the best performing models, respectively, demonstrating overall accuracies of 87.9% and 84.2% (single best code), and 96.8% and 94.0% (within top three). Classification accuracy was 96.4% in 47.0% of cases using support vector machine and 94.4% in 62.2% of cases using label-embedding attentive model within the Train/Test dataset. In the Holdout dataset, respective classification accuracies were 93.1% in 58.0% of cases and 95.0% among 62.0%. The most important feature in model training was procedure text.Conclusions:Through application of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, highly accurate real-time models were created for anesthesiology Current Procedural Terminology code classification. The increased processing speed and a priori targeted accuracy of this classification approach may provide performance optimization and cost reduction for quality improvement, research, and reimbursement tasks reliant on anesthesiology procedure codes.

T2  - PEC innovation
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: Patient comprehension of informed consent and demonstration of procedural understanding is often lacking in anesthesiology. The purpose of this study was to determine if patient communication in anesthesiology is being conducted effectively, and in a manner that ensures adequate communication between anesthesia professionals and their patients regarding procedures with associated risks and benefits.Methods: Anesthesia professionals were recorded in a simulated setting explaining anesthesia procedures of increasing complexity with one control scenario. Score means were calculated, and statistical comparisons made between discussion of anesthesia procedures and the control scenario.Results: Calculation of means for 6 readability tests demonstrated the grade level required to understand the medical practitioners' verbal communication was high and increased with complexity of the anesthesia procedure described. The control scenario required a statistically significant lower level of comprehension for the recipient of the information.Conclusion: In simulated settings, anesthesia professionals regularly communicate procedural details in a manner that is difficult for the general public to understand. Subjects could communicate in simple terms when discussing a control.Innovation: This pilot study demonstrated effective methodology, using artificial intelligence technology for transcription, to assess patient comprehension of verbal communication.

TI  - Anesthesia and monitoring techniques in respiratory interventional diagnosis and treatment
T2  - Chinese Journal of Practical Internal Medicine
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern respiratory interventional diagnosis and treatment is increasingly sophisticated and complex. The application such as cryotherapy, laser therapy and endobronchial ultrasound is becoming more and more popular. New artificial intelligence systems such as robot-assisted bronchoscopy system and transbronchoscopy navigation technology are also gradually applied in clinical practice. With the rapid development of these new materials, technologies and artificial intelligence systems, interventional pulmonary medicine has become an indispensable part of the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases. Complicated and changeable respiratory interventional operations also put forward higher requirements for sedation and anesthesia. It is a great challenge for anesthesiologists to ensure the safety and comfort of patients while sharing the airway with the operator, and to provide a safe operating environment for the operator. During respiratory intervention, complications such as asphyxia, hemoptysis, pneumothorax, and cardiovascular events may occur. It is also very important to implement perioperative monitoring and management.

TI  - Machine learning reveals interhemispheric somatosensory coherence as indicator of anesthetic depth
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study was to identify features in mouse electrocorticogram recordings that indicate the depth of anesthesia as approximated by the administered anesthetic dosage. Anesthetic depth in laboratory animals must be precisely monitored and controlled. However, for the most common lab species (mice) few indicators useful for monitoring anesthetic depth have been established. We used electrocorticogram recordings in mice, coupled with peripheral stimulation, in order to identify features of brain activity modulated by isoflurane anesthesia and explored their usefulness in monitoring anesthetic depth through machine learning techniques. Using a gradient boosting regressor framework we identified interhemispheric somatosensory coherence as the most informative and reliable electrocorticogram feature for determining anesthetic depth, yielding good generalization and performance over many subjects. Knowing that interhemispheric somatosensory coherence indicates the effectively administered isoflurane concentration is an important step for establishing better anesthetic monitoring protocols and closed-loop systems for animal surgeries.

TI  - Machine learning algorithms predict extended postoperative opioid use in primary total knee arthroplasty
T2  - KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Adequate postoperative pain control following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is required to achieve optimal patient recovery. However, the postoperative recovery may lead to an unnaturally extended opioid use, which has been associated with adverse outcomes. This study hypothesizes that machine learning models can accurately predict extended opioid use following primary TKA. Methods A total of 8873 consecutive patients that underwent primary TKA were evaluated, including 643 patients (7.2%) with extended postoperative opioid use (> 90 days). Electronic patient records were manually reviewed to identify patient demographics and surgical variables associated with prolonged postoperative opioid use. Five machine learning algorithms were developed, encompassing the breadth of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms available in the literature, to predict extended opioid use following primary TKA, and these models were assessed by discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis. Results The strongest predictors for prolonged opioid prescription following primary TKA were preoperative opioid duration (100% importance; p < 0.01), drug abuse (54% importance; p < 0.01), and depression (47% importance; p < 0.01). The five machine learning models all achieved excellent performance across discrimination (AUC > 0.83), calibration, and decision curve analysis. Higher net benefits for all machine learning models were demonstrated, when compared to the default strategies of changing management for all patients or no patients. Conclusion The study findings show excellent model performance for the prediction of extended postoperative opioid use following primary total knee arthroplasty, highlighting the potential of these models to assist in preoperatively identifying at risk patients, and allowing the implementation of individualized peri-operative counselling and pain management strategies to mitigate complications associated with prolonged opioid use.

TI  - Optimal adaptive control of drug dosing using integral reinforcement learning
T2  - MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimal adaptive control approach is proposed for the continuous infusion of a sedative drug to maintain a required level of sedation. To illustrate the proposed method, we use the common anesthetic drug propofol used in intensive care units (ICUs). The proposed online integral reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm is designed to provide optimal drug dosing for a given performance measure that iteratively updates the control solution with respect to the pharmacology of the patient while guaranteeing convergence to the optimal solution. Numerical results are presented using 10 simulated patients that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IRL-based controller.

TI  - Adaptive fuzzy modeling of the hypnotic process in anesthesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the problem of patient model synthesis in anesthesia. Recent advanced drug infusion mechanisms use a patient model to establish the proper drug dose. However, due to the inherent complexity and variability of the patient dynamics, difficulty obtaining a good model is high. In this paper, a method based on fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms is proposed as an alternative to standard compartmental models. The model uses a Mamdani type fuzzy inference system developed in a two-step procedure. First, an offline model is obtained using information from real patients. Then, an adaptive strategy that uses genetic algorithms is implemented. The validation of the modeling technique was done using real data obtained from real patients in the operating room. Results show that the proposed method based on artificial intelligence appears to be an improved alternative to existing compartmental methodologies.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Stroke Volume Estimation Outperforms Conventional Arterial Contour Method in Patients with Hemodynamic Instability
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the stroke volume (SV) estimation by arterial blood pressure has been widely used in clinical practice, its accuracy is questionable, especially during periods of hemodynamic instability. We aimed to create novel SV estimating model based on deep-learning (DL) method. A convolutional neural network was applied to estimate SV from arterial blood pressure waveform data recorded from liver transplantation (LT) surgeries. The model was trained using a gold standard referential SV measured via pulmonary artery thermodilution method. Merging a gold standard SV and corresponding 10.24 seconds of arterial blood pressure waveform as an input/output data set with 2-senconds of sliding overlap, 484,384 data sets from 34 LT surgeries were used for training and validation of DL model. The performance of DL model was evaluated by correlation and concordance analyses in another 491,353 data sets from 31 LT surgeries. We also evaluated the performance of pre-existing commercialized model (EV1000), and the performance results of DL model and EV1000 were compared. The DL model provided an acceptable performance throughout the surgery (r = 0.813, concordance rate = 74.15%). During the reperfusion phase, where the most severe hemodynamic instability occurred, DL model showed superior correlation (0.861; 95% Confidence Interval, (CI), 0.855-0.866 vs. 0.570; 95% CI, 0.556-0.584, P < 0.001) and higher concordance rate (90.6% vs. 75.8%) over EV1000. In conclusion, the DL-based model was superior for estimating intraoperative SV and thus might guide physicians to precise intraoperative hemodynamic management. Moreover, the DL model seems to be particularly promising because it outperformed EV1000 in circumstance of rapid hemodynamic changes where physicians need most help.

TI  - Closed-loop control of anesthesia and mean arterial pressure using reinforcement learning
T2  - BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - General anesthesia is required for some patients in the intensive care units (ICUs) with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Critically ill patients who are assisted by mechanical ventilators require moderate sedation for several days to ensure cooperative and safe treatment in the ICU, reduce anxiety and delirium, facilitate sleep, and increase patient tolerance to endotracheal tube insertion. However, most anesthetics affect cardiac and respiratory functions. Hence, it is important to monitor and control the infusion of anesthetics to meet sedation requirements while keeping patient vital parameters within safe limits. The critical task of anesthesia administration also necessitates that drug dosing be optimal, patient specific, and robust. In this paper, the concept of reinforcement learning (RL) is used to develop a closed-loop anesthesia controller using the bispectral index (BIS) as a control variable while concurrently accounting for mean arterial pressure (MAP). In particular, the proposed framework uses these two parameters to control propofol infusion rates to regulate the BIS and MAP within a desired range. Specifically, a weighted combination of the error of the BIS and MAP signals is considered in the proposed RL algorithm. This reduces the computational complexity of the RL algorithm and consequently the controller processing time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Prediction of cervical spine injury in young pediatric patients: an optimal trees artificial intelligence approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Cervical spine injuries (CSI) are a major concern in young pediatric trauma patients. The consequences of missed injuries and difficulties in injury clearance for non-verbal patients have led to a tendency to image young children. Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT) scans, presents risks including radiation-induced carcinogenesis. In this study we leverage machine learning methods to develop highly accurate clinical decision rules to predict pediatric CSI.Methods: The PEDSPINE I registry was used to investigate CSI in blunt trauma patients under the age of three. Predictive models were built using Optimal Classification Trees, a novel machine learning approach offering high accuracy and interpretability, as well as other widely used machine learning methods.Results: The final Optimal Classification Trees model predicts injury based on overall Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and patient age. This model has a sensitivity of 93.3% and specificity of 82.3% on the full dataset It has comparable or superior peiforrnance to other machine learning methods as well as existing clinical decision rules.Conclusions: This study developed a decision rule that achieves high injury identification while reducing unnecessary imaging. It demonstrates the value of machine learning in improving clinical decision protocols for pediatric trauma.Type of study: Retrospective Prognosis Study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The fields of pediatric gastrointestinal endoscopy and sedation are critically important to the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) disease in children. Since its inception in the 1970s, pediatric endoscopy has benefitted from tremendous technological innovation related to the design of the endoscope and its associated equipment. Not only that, but expertise among pediatric gastroenterologists has moved the field forward to include a full complement of diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic procedures in children. In this review, we discuss the remarkable history of pediatric endoscopy and highlight current limitations and future advances in the practice and technology of pediatric endoscopy and sedation.

TI  - Consistency of the anesthesia consciousness index versus the bispectral index during laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery with sevoflurane anesthesia: A prospective multi-center randomized controlled clinical study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to compare the consistency of anesthesia consciousness index (Ai) with that of bispectral index (BIS) in monitoring the depth of anesthesia (DOA) during sevoflurane anesthesia, to reveal the optimal cutoff values in different states of consciousness, and explore the stability of DOA monitoring during intraoperative injurious stimulation. MethodsWe enrolled 145 patients (97 men and 48 women) from 10 medical centers. General anesthesia was induced using intravenous anesthetics and maintained with sevoflurane. Ai and BIS values were recorded. ResultsThe mean difference between the Ai and BIS was-0.1747 (95% confidence interval, -0.6660 to 0.3166; p = 0.4857). The regression equation of Ai and BIS from the Deming regression analysis was y = 5.6387 + 0.9067x (y is BIS, x is Ai), and the slope and intercept were statistically significant. Meanwhile, the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, loss of consciousness, and recovery of consciousness revealed that the accuracy of Ai and BIS were similar. In addition, the optimal cutoff values of the different states of consciousness were not sensitive to age, and both Ai and BIS had no correlation with hemodynamics. ConclusionWe conclude that Ai and BIS show no systematic deviation in readings with high consistency, similar accuracy, and good stability; these insights provide more data for clinical application.

TI  - Patient-Centered Pain Care Using Artificial Intelligence and Mobile Health Tools: Protocol for a Randomized Study Funded by the US Department of Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development Program.
T2  - JMIR research protocols
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for chronic low back pain. However, only half of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients have access to trained CBT therapists, and program expansion is costly. CBT typically consists of 10 weekly hour-long sessions. However, some patients improve after the first few sessions while others need more extensive contact.OBJECTIVE: We are applying principles from "reinforcement learning" (a field of artificial intelligence or AI) to develop an evidence-based, personalized CBT pain management service that automatically adapts to each patient's unique and changing needs (AI-CBT). AI-CBT uses feedback from patients about their progress in pain-related functioning measured daily via pedometer step counts to automatically personalize the intensity and type of patient support. The specific aims of the study are to (1) demonstrate that AI-CBT has pain-related outcomes equivalent to standard telephone CBT, (2) document that AI-CBT achieves these outcomes with more efficient use of clinician resources, and (3) demonstrate the intervention's impact on proximal outcomes associated with treatment response, including program engagement, pain management skill acquisition, and patients' likelihood of dropout.METHODS: In total, 320 patients with chronic low back pain will be recruited from 2 VA healthcare systems and randomized to a standard 10 sessions of telephone CBT versus AI-CBT. All patients will begin with weekly hour-long telephone counseling, but for patients in the AI-CBT group, those who demonstrate a significant treatment response will be stepped down through less resource-intensive alternatives including: (1) 15-minute contacts with a therapist, and (2) CBT clinician feedback provided via interactive voice response calls (IVR). The AI engine will learn what works best in terms of patients' personally tailored treatment plans based on daily feedback via IVR about their pedometer-measured step counts, CBT skill practice, and physical functioning. Outcomes will be measured at 3 and 6 months post recruitment and will include pain-related interference, treatment satisfaction, and treatment dropout. Our primary hypothesis is that AI-CBT will result in pain-related functional outcomes that are at least as good as the standard approach, and that by scaling back the intensity of contact that is not associated with additional gains in pain control, the AI-CBT approach will be significantly less costly in terms of therapy time.RESULTS: The trial is currently in the start-up phase. Patient enrollment will begin in the fall of 2016 and results of the trial will be available in the winter of 2019.CONCLUSIONS: This study will evaluate an intervention that increases patients' access to effective CBT pain management services while allowing health systems to maximize program expansion given constrained resources.

TI  - Optimizing Operation Room Utilization-A Prediction Model
T2  - BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Operating rooms are the core of hospitals. They are a primary source of revenue and are often seen as one of the bottlenecks in the medical system. Many efforts are made to increase throughput, reduce costs, and maximize incomes, as well as optimize clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. We trained a predictive model on the length of surgeries to improve the productivity and utility of operative rooms in general hospitals. Methods: We collected clinical and administrative data for the last 10 years from two large general public hospitals in Israel. We trained a machine learning model to give the expected length of surgery using pre-operative data. These data included diagnoses, laboratory tests, risk factors, demographics, procedures, anesthesia type, and the main surgeon's level of experience. We compared our model to a naive model that represented current practice. Findings: Our prediction model achieved better performance than the naive model and explained almost 70% of the variance in surgery durations. Interpretation: A machine learning-based model can be a useful approach for increasing operating room utilization. Among the most important factors were the type of procedures and the main surgeon's level of experience. The model enables the harmonizing of hospital productivity through wise scheduling and matching suitable teams for a variety of clinical procedures for the benefit of the individual patient and the system as a whole.

AB  - Aim: To develop an automated system to monitor sedation levels in intensive care unit patients using heart rate variability (HRV).Methods: We developed an automatic sedation level prediction system using HRV as input to a support vector machine learning algorithm. Our data consisted of electrocardiogram recordings from a heterogeneous group of 50 mechanically ventilated adults receiving sedatives in an ICU setting. The target variable was the Richmond agitation-sedation scale score, grouped into four levels: "comatose" (-5), "deeply sedated" (-4 to -3), "lightly sedated" (-2 to 0), and "agitated" (+1 to +4). As input we used 14 features derived from the normalized-RR (NN) interval. We used leave-one-subject-out cross-validated accuracy to measure system performance.Results: A patient-independent version of the proposed system discriminated between the 4 sedation levels with an overall accuracy of 52%. A patient-specific version, where the training data was supplemented with the patient's labeled HRV epochs from the preceding 24 hours, improved classification accuracy to 60%.Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that the HRV varies systematically with sedation levels and has potential to supplement current clinical sedation level assessment methods. With additional variables such as disease pathology, and pharmacological data, the proposed system could lead to a fully automated system for depth of sedation monitoring

TI  - I-Corps: Developing a data analytics platform for pain management and alternative treatment
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to provide insight to support pain management with minimal intervention.   The envisioned system uses off-the-shelf mobile and wearable devices already available as consumer devices to minimize costs to the consumer, recording pain episodes, sleep patterns, and associated lifestyle factors impacting pain management.   Furthermore, it will enable communication between patients and health care providers so they can jointly identify effective treatment regimens to manage pain and reduce health care costs.  It is anticipated that this will have particular value for shoulder, back and other musculoskeletal pains.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project draws on artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning algorithms to help patients record their pain episodes, sleep and exercise patterns, and related activities. The research on which this project is based has shown that mobile and wearable devices are able to utilize sensors, including accelerometers, high-definition cameras, gyroscopes, thermometers and other environmental sensors, to collect diverse data and produce intelligent deep learning algorithms. Additional studies suggest that healthy lifestyles and alternative treatments impact reduced use of prescription drugs. The technology in this project provides an infrastructure for patients to collect their own data securely. Patients and health providers can access these data through an internet-based platform to analyze factors such as: 1) patient sleep patterns, exercises and similar activities; 2) frequency and severity of pain episodes; and 3) treatment effectiveness. The technology will serve as a technological infrastructure for patients to manage chronic pain intelligently. It also will support the development of related smart and connected health applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - With an increase in geriatric population undergoing surgical procedures, research focused on enhancing their perioperative outcomes is of paramount importance. Currently, most of the evidence-based medicine protocols are driven by studies concentrating on adults encompassing all adult age groups. Given the alterations in physiology with aging, geriatric patients respond differently to anesthetics and, therefore, require specific research initiatives to further expound on the same. Large databases and the development of sophisticated analytic tools can provide meaningful insights into this. Here, we discuss a few research opportunities and challenges that data scientists face when focusing on geriatric perioperative research.

TI  - Machine Vision and Image Analysis in Anesthesia: Narrative Review and Future Prospects
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Machine vision describes the use of artificial intelligence to interpret, analyze, and derive predictions from image or video data. Machine vision-based techniques are already in clinical use in radiology, ophthalmology, and dermatology, where some applications currently equal or exceed the performance of specialty physicians in areas of image interpretation. While machine vision in anesthesia has many potential applications, its development remains in its infancy in our specialty. Early research for machine vision in anesthesia has focused on automated recognition of anatomical structures during ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia or line insertion; recognition of the glottic opening and vocal cords during video laryngoscopy; prediction of the difficult airway using facial images; and clinical alerts for endobronchial intubation detected on chest radiograph. Current machine vision applications measuring the distance between endotracheal tube tip and carina have demonstrated noninferior performance compared to board-certified physicians. The performance and potential uses of machine vision for anesthesia will only grow with the advancement of underlying machine vision algorithm technical performance developed outside of medicine, such as convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. This article summarizes recently published works of interest, provides a brief overview of techniques used to create machine vision applications, explains frequently used terms, and discusses challenges the specialty will encounter as we embrace the advantages that this technology may bring to future clinical practice and patient care. As machine vision emerges onto the clinical stage, it is critically important that anesthesiologists are prepared to confidently assess which of these devices are safe, appropriate, and bring added value to patient care.

TI  - Automated Nociceptive Pain Assessment Using Physiological Signals and a Hybrid Deep Learning Network
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Postoperative pain management has become a major medical and nursing challenge. Nowadays, hospitals have taken initiatives to measure acute pain using self-report measures like the Visual Analogue Scale and Numeric Pain Intensity Scale. But these methods are inaccurate as it depends on patient's input. Therefore, there is a requirement for an objective, quantitative method to monitor pain continuously. In this work, an automated acute nociceptive pain recognition system was proposed to objectively measure nociceptive pain using physiological signals and a hybrid Deep Learning network. The hybrid deep learning network constitutes a shallow CNN network that extracts the essential information of the pain from the physiological signals and the extracted feature matrix is fed to the LSTM network for feature concatenation. This process realizes the mapping of nociceptive pain from input data to detection. This work utilizes the BioVid Heat Pain database. A Unimodal hybrid CNN_LSTM network (using ECG signals) has achieved 68.70 percent, 62.61 percent, 67.86 percent, and 75.21 percent of classification accuracy for classification events (BL1 Vs PA1, BL1 Vs PA2, BL1 Vs PA3, and BL1 Vs PA4). Similarly, for classification events (BL1 Vs PA1, BL1 Vs PA2, BL1 Vs PA3, and BL1 Vs PA4), the unimodal hybrid CNN_LSTM network (using EDA signals) achieved 85.65 percent, 74.47 percent, 80.80 percent, and 80.17 percent of classification accuracy. Finally, for classification events (BL1 Vs PA1, BL1 Vs PA2, BL1 Vs PA3, and BL1 Vs PA4), the CNN_LSTM multimodal hybrid network (using both ECG and EDA signals) achieved 93.91 percent, 86.97 percent, 90.75 percent, and 94.12 percent of the classification accuracy, respectively.

TI  - Physiological closed-loop control in critical care: opportunities for innovations
T2  - PROGRESS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Physiological closed-loop control (PCLC) systems are a key enabler for automation and clinician support in medicine, including, but not limited to, patient monitoring, diagnosis, clinical decision making, and therapy delivery. Existing body of work has demonstrated that PCLC systems hold the promise to advance critical care as well as a wide range of other domains in medicine bearing profound implications in quality of life, quality of care, and human wellbeing. However, the state-of-the-art PCLC technology in critical care is associated with long-standing limitations related to its development and assessment, including (a) isolated and loop-by-loop PCLC design without sufficient account for multi-faceted patient physiology, (b) suboptimal choice of therapeutic endpoints, (c) concerns related to collective safety originating from multi-PCLC interferences, and (d) premature PCLC assessment methodology. Such limitations naturally motivate research to generate new knowledge and create innovative methods. In this perspective, we propose several high-reward opportunities that can accelerate the advances in PCLC systems, which may be explored by deep fusion and collaboration among multiple disciplines including physiological systems and signals analysis, control and estimation, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and wearable sensing and embedded computing technologies.

AB  - Hybrid imaging systems, consisting of fluoroscopy and echocardiography, are increasingly selected for intra-operative support of minimally invasive cardiac interventions. Intracardiac echocardiograpy (ICE) is an emerging modality with the promise of removing sedation or general anesthesia associated with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).We introduce a novel 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) pose estimation approach for catheters (equipped with radiopaque ball markers) in single X-Ray fluoroscopy projection and investigate the method's application to a prototype ICE catheter. Machine learning based catheter detection is implemented in a Bayesian hypothesis fusion framework, followed by refinement of ball marker locations through template matching. Marker correspondence and 3D pose estimation are solved through iterative optimization.The method registers the ICE volume to the C-arm coordinate system. Experiments are performed on synthetic and porcine in-vivo data. Target registration error (TRE), defined in the echo cone, is the basis of our preliminary evaluation. The method reached 8.06 +/- 7.2 mm TRE on 703 cases.Potential uses of our hybrid system include structural heart disease interventions and electrophysiologycal mapping or catheter ablation procedures.

TI  - Critical element prediction of tracheal intubation difficulty: Automatic Mallampati classification by jointly using handcrafted and attention-based deep features
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Preoperative assessment of the difficulty of tracheal intubation is of great importance in anesthesia practice because failed intubation can lead to severe complications and even death. The Mallampati score is widely used as a critical assessment criterion in combination with other measures to assess the difficulty of tracheal intu-bation. The performance of existing methods for Mallampati classification with artificial intelligence (AI) is unreliable to the extent that the current clinical judgment of the Mallampati score relies entirely on doctors' experience. In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic Mallampati classification. Our method extracts deep features that are more favorable for the Mallampati classification task by introducing an attention mech-anism into the basic deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and then further improves the classification performance by jointly using attention-based deep features with handcrafted features. We conducted experi-ments on a dataset consisting of 321 oral images collected online. The proposed method has a classification accuracy of 97.50%, a sensitivity of 96.52%, a specificity of 98.05%, and an F1 score of 96.52% after five-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that our proposed method is superior to other methods, can assist doctors in determining Mallampati class objectively and accurately, and provide an essential reference element for assessing the difficulty of tracheal intubation.

TI  - Central Hypovolemia Detection During Environmental Stress-A Role for Artificial Intelligence?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The first step to exercise is preceded by the required assumption of the upright body position, which itself involves physical activity. The gravitational displacement of blood from the chest to the lower parts of the body elicits a fall in central blood volume (CBV), which corresponds to the fraction of thoracic blood volume directly available to the left ventricle. The reduction in CBV and stroke volume (SV) in response to postural stress, post-exercise, or to blood loss results in reduced left ventricular filling, which may manifest as orthostatic intolerance. When termination of exercise removes the leg muscle pump function, CBV is no longer maintained. The resulting imbalance between a reduced cardiac output (CO) and a still enhanced peripheral vascular conductance may provoke post-exercise hypotension (PEH). Instruments that quantify CBV are not readily available and to express which magnitude of the CBV in a healthy subject should remains difficult. In the physiological laboratory, the CBV can be modified by making use of postural stressors, such as lower body "negative" or sub-atmospheric pressure (LBNP) or passive head-up tilt (HUT), while quantifying relevant biomedical parameters of blood flow and oxygenation. Several approaches, such as wearable sensors and advanced machine-learning techniques, have been followed in an attempt to improve methodologies for better prediction of outcomes and to guide treatment in civil patients and on the battlefield. In the recent decade, efforts have been made to develop algorithms and apply artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of hemodynamic monitoring. Advances in quantifying and monitoring CBV during environmental stress from exercise to hemorrhage and understanding the analogy between postural stress and central hypovolemia during anesthesia offer great relevance for healthy subjects and clinical populations.

T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we present a deep reinforcement learning-based approach as a baseline system for autonomous propofol infusion control. Specifically, design an environment for simulating the possible conditions of a target patient based on input demographic data and design our reinforcement learning model-based system so that it effectively makes predictions on the proper level of propofol infusion to maintain stable anesthesia even under dynamic conditions that can affect the decision-making process, such as the manual control of remifentanil by anesthesiologists and the varying patient conditions under anesthesia. Through an extensive set of evaluations using patient data from 3000 subjects, we show that the proposed method results in stabilization in the anesthesia state, by managing the bispectral index (BIS) and effect-site concentration for a patient showing varying conditions.

TI  - Human-AI teaming: leveraging transactive memory and speaking up for enhanced team effectiveness
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this prospective observational study, we investigate the role of transactive memory and speaking up in human-AI teams comprising 180 intensive care (ICU) physicians and nurses working with AI in a simulated clinical environment. Our findings indicate that interactions with AI agents differ significantly from human interactions, as accessing information from AI agents is positively linked to a team's ability to generate novel hypotheses and demonstrate speaking-up behavior, but only in higher-performing teams. Conversely, accessing information from human team members is negatively associated with these aspects, regardless of team performance. This study is a valuable contribution to the expanding field of research on human-AI teams and team science in general, as it emphasizes the necessity of incorporating AI agents as knowledge sources in a team's transactive memory system, as well as highlighting their role as catalysts for speaking up. Practical implications include suggestions for the design of future AI systems and human-AI team training in healthcare and beyond.

TI  - Rethinking the Role of Normalization and Residual Blocks for Spiking Neural Networks
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biologically inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) are widely used to realize ultralow-power energy consumption. However, deep SNNs are not easy to train due to the excessive firing of spiking neurons in the hidden layers. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel but simple normalization technique called postsynaptic potential normalization. This normalization removes the subtraction term from the standard normalization and uses the second raw moment instead of the variance as the division term. The spike firing can be controlled, enabling the training to proceed appropriately, by conducting this simple normalization to the postsynaptic potential. The experimental results show that SNNs with our normalization outperformed other models using other normalizations. Furthermore, through the pre-activation residual blocks, the proposed model can train with more than 100 layers without other special techniques dedicated to SNNs.

TI  - Expectations of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Professionals Toward Artificial Intelligence: Observational Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications offer numerous opportunities to improve health care. To be used in the intensive care unit, AI must meet the needs of staff, and potential barriers must be addressed through joint action by all stakeholders. It is thus critical to assess the needs and concerns of anesthesiologists and intensive care physicians related to AI in health care throughout Europe.Objective: This Europe-wide, cross-sectional observational study investigates how potential users of AI systems in anesthesiology and intensive care assess the opportunities and risks of the new technology. The web-based questionnaire was based on the established analytic model of acceptance of innovations by Rogers to record 5 stages of innovation acceptance.Methods: The questionnaire was sent twice in 2 months (March 11, 2021, and November 5, 2021) through the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) member email distribution list. A total of 9294 ESAIC members were reached, of whom 728 filled out the questionnaire (response rate 728/9294, 8%). Due to missing data, 27 questionnaires were excluded.Results: A total of 701 questionnaires (female: n=299, 42%) were analyzed. Overall, 265 (37.8%) of the participants have been in contact with AI and evaluated the benefits of this technology higher (mean 3.22, SD 0.39) than participants who stated no previous contact (mean 3.01, SD 0.48). Physicians see the most benefits of AI application in early warning systems (335/701, 48% strongly agreed, and 358/701, 51% agreed). Major potential disadvantages were technical problems (236/701, 34% strongly agreed, and 410/701, 58% agreed) and handling difficulties (126/701, 18% strongly agreed, and 462/701, 66% agreed), both of which could be addressed by Europe-wide digitalization and education. In addition, the lack of a secure legal basis for the research and use of medical AI in the European Union leads doctors to expect problems with legal liability (186/701, 27% strongly agreed, and 374/701, 53% agreed) and data protection (148/701, 21% strongly agreed, and 343/701, 49% agreed).Conclusions: Anesthesiologists and intensive care personnel are open to AI applications in their professional field and expect numerous benefits for staff and patients. Regional differences in the digitalization of the private sector are not reflected in the acceptance of AI among health care professionals. Physicians anticipate technical difficulties and lack a stable legal basis for the use of AI. Training for medical staff could increase the benefits of AI in professional medicine. Therefore, we suggest that the development and implementation of AI in health care require a solid technical, legal, and ethical basis, as well as adequate education and training of users.

M3  - Article
AB  - Anesthesia drug overdose hazards and lack of gold standards in anesthesia monitoring lead to an urgent need for accurate anesthesia drug detection. To investigate the PPG waveform features affected by anesthesia drugs and develop a machine-learning classifier with high anesthesia drug sensitivity. This study used 64 anesthesia and non-anesthesia patient data (32 cases each), extracted from Queensland and MIMIC-II databases, respectively. The key waveform features (total area, rising time, width 75%, 50%, and 25%) were extracted from 16,310 signal recordings (5-s duration). Discriminant analysis, support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) were evaluated by splitting the dataset into halve training (11 patients, 8570 segments) and halve testing dataset (11 patients, 7740 segments). Significant differences exist between PPG waveform features of anesthesia and non-anesthesia groups (p < 0.05) except total area feature (p > 0.05). The KNN classifier achieved 91.7% (AUC = 0.95) anesthesia detection accuracy with the highest sensitivity (0.88) and specificity (0.90) as compared to other classifiers. Kohen's kappa also shows almost perfect agreement (0.79) with the KNN classifier. The KNN classifier trained with significant PPG features has the potential to be used as a reliable, non-invasive, and low-cost method for the detection of anesthesia drugs for depth analysis during surgical operations and postoperative monitoring.

TI  - Establishment of model for predicting mortality risk after abdominal surgery using preoperative indices based on different machine learning algorithms
T2  - Chinese Journal of Anesthesiology
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To establish the model for predicting the mortality risk after abdominal surgery using preoperative indices based on different machine learning algorithms. Methods Fifty patients died after abdominal surgery with general anesthesia from June 2015 to December 2018 in our hospital were enrolled in the study. Based on the types of surgery and age of dead patients, 150 patients who were discharged from hospital upon recovery postoperatively were randomly selected from our database as control cases with a ratio of 1: 3. The total dataset of 200 patients was randomly divided into training dataset (n = 140) and testing dataset (n = 60). Preoperative indices (each index of baseline characteristics, each index of anesthesia interview information and indices of preoperative examination) were used to develop the model for predicting the mortality risk after abdominal surgery based on four machine learning algorithms AdaBoost, GBDT, LR, and SVM, and the model was evaluated in the testing dataset. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of models developed using preoperative index based on AdaBoost, GBDT, LR, and SVM for predicting the postoperative mortality risk were 0.796,0.794, 0. 846 and 0. 781, respectively. There were no significant differences in area under the receiver operating characteristic curves among different models (P>0. 05). Conclusion The model for predicting mortality risk after abdominal surgery using preoperative indicators based on different machine learning algorithms is successfully established.

TI  - Intracranial pressure based decision making: Prediction of suspected increased intracranial pressure with machine learning
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Repeated invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is desirable because many neurosurgical pathologies are associated with elevated ICP. On the other hand, it could become a risk for children to repeat sedation, anesthesia, or radiation exposure. As a non-invasive method, measurements of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has been revealed to accurately predict increased ICP. However, no studies have indicated a relationship among age, brain, and ventricular parameters in normal children, nor a prediction of increased ICP with artificial intelligence. Methods and findings This study enrolled 400 normal children for control and 75 children with signs of increased ICP between 2009 and 2019. Measurements of the parameters including ONSD on CT were obtained. A supervised machine learning was applied to predict suspected increased ICP based on CT measurements. A linear correlation was shown between ln(age) and mean ONSD (mONSD) in normal children, revealing mONSD = 0.36ln(age)+2.26 (R-2= 0.60). This study revealed a linear correlation of mONSD measured on CT with ln(age) and the width of the brain, not the width of the ventricles in 400 normal children based on the univariate analyses. Additionally, the multivariate analyses revealed minimum bicaudate nuclei distance was also associated with mONSD. The results of the group comparison between control and suspected increased ICP revealed a statistical significance in mONSD and the width of the ventricles. The study indicated that supervised machine learning application could be applied to predict suspected increased ICP in children, with an accuracy of 94% for training, 91% for test. Conclusions This study clarified three issues regarding ONSD and ICP. Mean ONSD measured on CT was correlated with ln(age) and the width of the brain, not the width of the ventricles in 400 normal children based on the univariate analyses. The multivariate analyses revealed minimum bicaudate nuclei distance was also associated with mONSD. Mean ONSD and the width of ventricles were statistically significant in children with signs of elevated ICP. Finally, the study showed that machine learning could be used to predict children with suspected increased ICP.

TI  - A machine-learning approach for decision support and risk stratification of pediatric perioperative patients based on the APRICOT dataset
T2  - PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pediatric anesthesia has evolved to a high level of patient safety, yet a small chance remains for serious perioperative complications, even in those tradition- ally considered at low risk. In practice, prediction of at- risk patients currently relies on the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA- PS) score, despite reported inconsistencies with this method.Aims: The goal of this study was to develop predictive models that can classify children as low risk for anesthesia at the time of surgical booking and after anesthetic assessment on the procedure day.Methods: Our dataset was derived from APRICOT, a prospective observational cohort study conducted by 261 European institutions in 2014 and 2015. We included only the first procedure, ASA- PS classification I to III, and perioperative adverse events not classified as drug errors, reducing the total number of records to 30 325 with an ad- verse event rate of 4.43%. From this dataset, a stratified train:test split of 70:30 was used to develop predictive machine learning algorithms that could identify children in ASA- PS class I to III at low risk for severe perioperative critical events that included respiratory, cardiac, allergic, and neurological complications.Results: Our selected models achieved accuracies of >0.9, areas under the receiver operating curve of 0.6- 0.7, and negative predictive values >95%. Gradient boosting models were the best performing for both the booking phase and the day- of-surgery phase.Conclusions: This work demonstrates that prediction of patients at low risk of criti- cal PAEs can be made on an individual, rather than population-based, level by using machine learning. Our approach yielded two models that accommodate wide clinical variability and, with further development, are potentially generalizable to many surgi- cal centers.

AB  - Response to prescribed analgesic drugs varies between individuals, and choosing the right drug/dose often involves a lengthy, iterative process of trial and error. Furthermore, a significant portion of patients experience adverse events such as post-operative urinary retention (POUR) during inpatient management of acute postoperative pain.To better forecast analgesic responses, we compared conventional machine learning methods with modern neural network architectures to gauge their effectiveness at forecasting temporal patterns of postoperative pain and analgesic use, as well as predicting the risk of POUR. Our results indicate that simpler machine learning approaches might offer superior results; however, all of these techniques may play a promising role for developing smarter post-operative pain management strategies.

AB  - Neuroscience has generated a number of recent advances in the search for the neural correlates of consciousness, but these have yet to find valuable real-world applications. Electroencephalography under anesthesia provides a powerful experimental setup to identify electrophysiological signatures of altered states of consciousness, as well as a testbed for developing systems for automatic diagnosis and prognosis of awareness in clinical settings. In this work, we use deep convolutional neural networks to automatically differentiate sub-anesthetic states and depths of anesthesia, solely from one second of raw EEG signal. Our results with leave-one-participant-out-cross-validation show that behavioral measures, such as the Ramsay score, can be used to learn generalizable neural networks that reliably predict levels of unconsciousness in unseen transitional anesthetic states, as well as in unseen experimental setups and behaviors. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning to detect progressive changes in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness with higher granularity than behavioral or pharmacological markers. This work has broader significance for identifying generalized patterns of brain activity that index states of consciousness.

TI  - Anesthesiologists' Perspective on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anaesthesia in Terms of Medical Ethics and Medical Education: A Survey Study
T2  - EURASIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Controversy exists around the world as experts disagree on what artificial intelligence will imply for humanity in the future. Medical experts are starting to share perspectives on artificial intelligence with ethical and legal concerns appearing to prevail. The purpose of this study was to determine how anesthesiology and reanimation specialists in Turkey perceive the use of artificial intelligence in ultrasound-guided regional anesthetic applications in terms of medical ethics and education, as well as their perspectives on potential ethical issues.Materials and Methods: This descriptive and cross-sectional survey was conducted across Turkey between July 1 and August 31. Data were collected through an online questionnaire distributed by national associations and social media platforms. The questionnaire included questions about the descriptive features of the participants and the possible ethical problems that may be encountered in the use of artificial intelligence in regional anesthesia and 20 statements that were requested to be evaluated.Results: The average age of the 285 anesthesiologists who took part in the study was 42.00 & PLUSMN; 7.51, 144 of them were male, the average years spent in the field was 10.95 & PLUSMN; 7.15 years, 59.3% were involved in resident training, and 74.7% habitually used ultrasound guidance regional anesthetic applications. Of the participants, 80% thought artificial intelligence would benefit patients, 86.7% thought it would benefit resident training, 81.4% thought it would benefit post-graduate medical education, and 80.7% thought it would decrease complications in practice. There will be no ethical issues if sonographic data are captured anonymously, according to 78.25%, while 67% are concerned about who will be held accountable for inaccuracies.Conclusion: The majority of anesthetists believe that using artificial intelligence in regional anesthetic applications will decrease complications. Although ethical concerns about privacy and data governance are low, participants do have ethical worries about "accountability for errors."

TI  - Alpha rhythm collapse predicts iso-electric suppressions during anesthesia
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Could an overly deep sedation be anticipated from ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) patterns? We report here motifs hidden in the EEG signal that predict the appearance of Iso-Electric Suppressions (IES), observed during epileptic encephalopathies, drug intoxications, comatose, brain death or during anesthetic over-dosage that are considered to be detrimental. To show that IES occurrences can be predicted from EEG traces dynamics, we focus on transient suppression of the alpha rhythm (8-14 Hz) recorded for 80 patients, that had a Propofol target controlled infusion of 5 mu g/ml during a general anesthesia. We found that the first time of appearance as well as changes in duration of these Alpha-Suppressions (alpha S) are two parameters that anticipate the appearance of IES. Using machine learning, we predicted IES appearance from the first 10 min of EEG (AUC of 0.93). To conclude, transient motifs in the alpha rhythm predict IES during anesthesia and can be used to identify patients, with higher risks of post-operative complications.

TI  - Anaesthesia and patient safety in the socio-technical operating theatre: a narrative review spanning a century
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - We review the development of technology in anaesthesia over the course of the past century, from the invention of the Boyle apparatus to the modern anaesthetic workstation with artificial intelligence assistance. We define the operating theatre as a socio-technical system, being necessarily comprised of human and technological parts, the ongoing development of which has led to a reduction in mortality during anaesthesia by an order of four magnitudes over a century. The remarkable technological advances in anaesthesia have been accompanied by important paradigm shifts in the approach to patient safety, and we describe the inter-relationship between technology and the human work environment in the development of such paradigm shifts, including the systems approach and organisational resilience. A better understanding of emerging technological advances and their effects on patient safety will allow anaesthesia to continue to be a leader in both patient safety and in the design of equipment and workspaces.

TI  - Considerations for the implementation of machine learning into acute care settings
T2  - BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Management of patients in the acute care setting requires accurate diagnosis and rapid initiation of validated treatments; therefore, this setting is likely to be an environment in which cognitive augmentation of the clinician's provision of care with technology rooted in artificial intelligence, such as machine learning (ML), is likely to eventuate. Sources of data PubMed and Google Scholar with search terms that included ML, intensive/critical care unit, electronic health records (EHR), anesthesia information management systems and clinical decision support were the primary sources for this report. Areas of agreement Different categories of learning of large clinical datasets, often contained in EHRs, are used for training in ML. Supervised learning uses algorithm-based models, including support vector machines, to pair patients' attributes with an expected outcome. Unsupervised learning uses clustering algorithms to define to which disease grouping a patient's attributes most closely approximates. Reinforcement learning algorithms use ongoing environmental feedback to deterministically pursue likely patient outcome. Areas of controversy Application of ML can result in undesirable outcomes over concerns related to fairness, transparency, privacy and accountability. Whether these ML technologies irrevocably change the healthcare workforce remains unresolved. Growing points Well-resourced Learning Health Systems are likely to exploit ML technology to gain the fullest benefits for their patients. How these clinical advantages can be extended to patients in health systems that are neither well-endowed, nor have the necessary data gathering technologies, needs to be urgently addressed to avoid further disparities in healthcare.

TI  - Machine Learning Algorithm Using Electronic Chart-Derived Data to Predict Delirium After Elderly Hip Fracture Surgeries: A Retrospective Case-Control Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair surgery are at increased risk of delirium due to aging, comorbidities, and frailty. But current methods for identifying the high risk of deliriumamong hospitalized patients havemoderate accuracy and require extra questionnaires. Artificial intelligence makes it possible to establish machine learning models that predict incident delirium risk based on electronic health data. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study on elderly patients (>= 65 years of age) who received orthopedic repair with hip fracture under spinal or general anesthesia between June 1, 2018, and May 31, 2019. Anesthesia records and medical charts were reviewed to collect demographic, surgical, anesthetic features, and frailty index to explore potential risk factors for postoperative delirium. Delirium was assessed by trained nurses using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) every 12 h during the hospital stay. Four machine learning risk models were constructed to predict the incidence of postoperative delirium: random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoosting), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perception (MLP). K-fold cross-validation was deployed to accomplish internal validation and performance evaluation. Results: About 245 patients were included and postoperative delirium affected 12.2% (30/245) of the patients. Multiple logistic regression revealed that dementia/history of stroke [OR 3.063, 95% CI (1.231, 7.624)], blood transfusion [OR 2.631, 95% CI (1.055, 6.559)], and preparation time [OR 1.476, 95% CI (1.170, 1.862)] were associated with postoperative delirium, achieving an area under receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.779, 95% CI (0.703, 0.856). The accuracy of machine learning models for predicting the occurrence of postoperative delirium ranged from 83.67 to 87.75%. Machine learning methods detected 16 risk factors contributing to the development of delirium. Preparation time, frailty index uses of vasopressors during the surgery, dementia/history of stroke, duration of surgery, and anesthesia were the six most important risk factors of delirium. Conclusion: Electronic chart-derived machine learning models could generate hospital-specific delirium prediction models and calculate the contribution of risk factors to the occurrence of delirium. Further research is needed to evaluate the significance and applicability of electronic chart-derived machine learning models for the detection risk of delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair surgeries.

TI  - Predicting hypotension in perioperative and intensive care medicine
T2  - BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH-CLINICAL ANAESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Blood pressure is the main determinant of organ perfusion. Hypotension is common in patients having surgery and in critically ill patients. The severity and duration of hypotension are associated with hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction. Hypotension is mostly treated reactively after low blood pressure values have already occurred. However, prediction of hypotension before it becomes clinically apparent would allow the clinician to treat hypotension pre-emptively, thereby reducing the severity and duration of hypotension. Hypotension cannowbepredictedminutes before it actually occurs from the blood pressure waveform using machine-learning algorithms that can be trained to detect subtle changes in cardiovascular dynamics preceding clinically apparent hypotension. However, analyzing the complex cardiovascular system is a challenge because cardiovascular physiology is highly interdependent, works within complicated networks, and is influenced by compensatory mechanisms. Improved hemodynamic data collection and integration will be a key to improve current models and develop new hypotension prediction models. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pose-invariant and occlusion-robust neonatal facial pain assessment
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Neonatal Facial Pain Assessment (NFPA) is essential to improve neonatal pain management. Pose variation and occlusion, which can significantly alter the facial appearance, are two major and still unstudied barriers to NFPA. We bridge this gap in terms of method and dataset. Techniques to tackle both challenges in other tasks either expect pose/occlusion-invariant deep learning methods or first generate a normal version of the input image before feature extraction, combining these we argue that it is more effective to jointly perform adversarial learning and end-to-end classification for their mutual benefit. To this end, we propose a Pose-invariant Occlusion-robust Pain Assessment (POPA) framework, with two novelties. We incorporate adversarial learning-based disturbance mitigation for end-to-end pain-level classification and propose a novel composite loss function for facial representation learning; compared to the vanilla discriminator that implicitly determines occlusion and pose conditions, we propose a multi-scale discriminator that determines explicitly, while incorporating local discriminators to enhance the discrimination of key regions. For a comprehensive evaluation, we built the first neonatal pain dataset with disturbance annotation involving 1091 neonates and also applied the proposed POPA to the facial expression recognition task. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments prove the superiority of the POPA.

TI  - Machine-learning vs. logistic regression for preoperative prediction of medical morbidity after fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty-a comparative study
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Machine-learning models may improve prediction of length of stay (LOS) and morbidity after surgery. However, few studies include fast-track programs, and most rely on administrative coding with limited follow-up and information on perioperative care. This study investigates potential benefits of a machine-learning model for prediction of postoperative morbidity in fast-track total hip (THA) and knee arthroplasty (TKA).Methods: Cohort study in consecutive unselected primary THA/TKA between 2014-2017 from seven Danish centers with established fast-track protocols. Preoperative comorbidity and prescribed medication were recorded prospectively and information on length of stay and readmissions was obtained through the Danish National Patient Registry and medical records. We used a machine-learning model (Boosted Decision Trees) based on boosted decision trees with 33 preoperative variables for predicting "medical" morbidity leading to LOS > 4 days or 90-days readmissions and compared to a logistical regression model based on the same variables. We also evaluated two parsimonious models, using the ten most important variables in the full machine-learning and logistic regression models. Data collected between 2014-2016 (n:18,013) was used for model training and data from 2017 (n:3913) was used for testing. Model performances were analyzed using precision, area under receiver operating (AUROC) and precision recall curves (AUPRC), as well as the Mathews Correlation Coefficient. Variable importance was analyzed using Shapley Additive Explanations values.Results: Using a threshold of 20% "risk-patients" (n:782), precision, AUROC and AUPRC were 13.6%, 76.3% and 15.5% vs. 12.4%, 74.7% and 15.6% for the machine-learning and logistic regression model, respectively. The parsimonious machine-learning model performed better than the full logistic regression model. Of the top ten variables, eight were shared between the machine-learning and logistic regression models, but with a considerable age-related variation in importance of specific types of medication.Conclusion: A machine-learning model using preoperative characteristics and prescriptions slightly improved identification of patients in high-risk of "medical" complications after fast-track THA and TKA compared to a logistic regression model. Such algorithms could help find a manageable population of patients who may benefit most from intensified perioperative care.

TI  - Assessment of the effect of continuous sedation with mechanical ventilation on adrenal insufficiency in patients with traumatic brain injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of continuous propofol sedation plus prolonged mechanical ventilation on adrenal insufficiency (AI) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Eighty-five adult patients diagnosed with moderate TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 9-13) from October 2011 to October 2012 were included in this prospective study. The patients comprised three groups: no mechanical ventilation and sedation (n=27), mechanical ventilation alone (n=24) and mechanical ventilation plus sedation (n=34). The low-dose short Synacthen test was performed at 8: 00 on the first, third, and fifth days after TBI. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors affecting the use of mechanical ventilation and sedation, and the incidence of AI. On the fifth day after injury, the mean baseline cortisol and simulated cortisol levels were significantly lower in the mechanical ventilation plus sedation group compared with the other two groups. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score was independently associated with treatment with mechanical ventilation and sedation compared to mechanical ventilation alone. Furthermore, hypoxemia on admission and shock were associated with the development of AI. The findings showed that sedation is associated with an increased incidence of AI. Patients with TBI who are treated with continuous sedation should be monitored for AI carefully.

TI  - Biophysical Model: A Promising Method in the Study of the Mechanism of Propofol: A Narrative Review
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The physiological and neuroregulatory mechanism of propofol is largely based on very limited knowledge. It is one of the important puzzling issues in anesthesiology and is of great value in both scientific and clinical fields. It is acknowledged that neural networks which are comprised of a number of neural circuits might be involved in the anesthetic mechanism. However, the mechanism of this hypothesis needs to be further elucidated. With the progress of artificial intelligence, it is more likely to solve this problem through using artificial neural networks to perform temporal waveform data analysis and to construct biophysical computational models. This review focuses on current knowledge regarding the anesthetic mechanism of propofol, an intravenous general anesthetic, by constructing biophysical computational models.

T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in assisting human electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis has become an active scientific field. This study aims to present a comprehensive review of the research field of AI-enhanced human EEG analysis. Using bibliometrics and topic modeling, research articles concerning AI-enhanced human EEG analysis collected from the Web of Science database during the period 2009-2018 were analyzed. After examining 2053 research articles published around the world, it was found that the annual number of articles had significantly grown from 78 to 468, with the USA and China being the most influential and prolific. The results of the keyword analysis showed that "electroencephalogram," "brain-computer interface," "classification," "support vector machine," "electroencephalography," and "signal" were the most frequently used. The results of topic modeling and evolution analyses highlighted several important issues, including epileptic seizure detection, brain-machine interface, EEG classification, mental disorders, emotion, and alcoholism and anesthesia. The findings suggest that such visualization and analysis of the research articles could provide a comprehensive overview of the field for communities of practice and inquiry worldwide.

TI  - Novel drug-independent sedation level estimation based on machine learning of quantitative frontal electroencephalogram features in healthy volunteers
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sedation indicators based on a single quantitative EEG (QEEG) feature have been criticised for their limited performance. We hypothesised that integration of multiple QEEG features into a single sedation-level estimator using a machine learning algorithm could reliably predict levels of sedation, independent of the sedative drug used.Methods: In total, 102 subjects receiving propofol (N =36 ; 16 male/20 female), sevoflurane (N =36 ; 16 male/20 female), or dexmedetomidine (N = 30 ; 15 male/15 female) were included in this study of healthy volunteers. Sedation level was assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score. We used 44 QEEG features estimated from the EEG data in a logistic regression algorithm, and an elastic-net regularisation method was used for feature selection. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the logistic regression model.Results: The performances obtained when the system was trained and tested as drug-dependent mode to distinguish between awake and sedated states (mean AUC [standard deviation]) were propofol=0.97 (0.03), sevoflurane=0.74 (0.25), and dexmedetomidine=0.77 (0.10). The drug-independent system resulted in mean AUC=0.83 (0.17) to discriminate between the awake and sedated states.Conclusions: The incorporation of large numbers of QEEG features and machine learning algorithms is feasible for next-generation monitors of sedation level. Different QEEG features were selected for propofol, sevoflurane, and dexmedetomidine groups, but the sedation-level estimator maintained a high performance for predicting MOANS independent of the drug used.

AB  - Opioids are the preferred medications for the treatment of pain in the intensive care unit. While under-treatment leads to unrelieved pain and poor clinical outcomes, excessive use of opioids puts patients at risk of experiencing multiple adverse effects. In this work, we present a sequential decision making framework for opioid dosing based on deep reinforcement learning. It provides real-time clinically interpretable dosing recommendations, personalized according to each patient's evolving pain and physiological condition. We focus on morphine, one of the most commonly prescribed opioids. To train and evaluate the model, we used retrospective data from the publicly available MIMIC-3 database. Our results demonstrate that reinforcement learning may be used to aid decision making in the intensive care setting by providing personalized pain management interventions.

TI  - Machine-learning model predicting postoperative delirium in older patients using intraoperative frontal electroencephalographic signatures
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveIn older patients receiving general anesthesia, postoperative delirium (POD) is the most frequent form of cerebral dysfunction. Early identification of patients at higher risk to develop POD could provide the opportunity to adapt intraoperative and postoperative therapy. We, therefore, propose a machine learning approach to predict the risk of POD in elderly patients, using routine intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) and clinical data that are readily available in the operating room. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of the data of a single-center study at the Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Department of Anesthesiology [ISRCTN 36437985], including 1,277 patients, older than 60 years with planned surgery and general anesthesia. To deal with the class imbalance, we used balanced ensemble methods, specifically Bagging and Random Forests and as a performance measure, the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). We trained our models including basic clinical parameters and intraoperative EEG features in particular classical spectral and burst suppression signatures as well as multi-band covariance matrices, which were classified, taking advantage of the geometry of a Riemannian manifold. The models were validated with 10 repeats of a 10-fold cross-validation. ResultsIncluding EEG data in the classification resulted in a robust and reliable risk evaluation for POD. The clinical parameters alone achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.75. Including EEG signatures improved the classification when the patients were grouped by anesthetic agents and evaluated separately for each group. The spectral features alone showed an AUC-ROC score of 0.66; the covariance features showed an AUC-ROC score of 0.68. The AUC-ROC scores of EEG features relative to patient data differed by anesthetic group. The best performance was reached, combining both the EEG features and the clinical parameters. Overall, the AUC-ROC score was 0.77, for patients receiving Propofol it was 0.78, for those receiving Sevoflurane it was 0.8 and for those receiving Desflurane 0.73. Applying the trained prediction model to an independent data set of a different clinical study confirmed these results for the combined classification, while the classifier on clinical parameters alone did not generalize. ConclusionA machine learning approach combining intraoperative frontal EEG signatures with clinical parameters could be an easily applicable tool to early identify patients at risk to develop POD.

TI  - Estimating the Depth of Anesthesia from EEG Signals Based on a Deep Residual Shrinkage Network
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliable monitoring of the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is essential to control the anesthesia procedure. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used to estimate DoA since EEG could reflect the effect of anesthetic drugs on the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we propose that a deep learning model consisting mainly of a deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN) and a 1 x 1 convolution network could estimate DoA in terms of patient state index (PSI) values. First, we preprocessed the four raw channels of EEG signals to remove electrical noise and other physiological signals. The proposed model then takes the preprocessed EEG signals as inputs to predict PSI values. Then we extracted 14 features from the preprocessed EEG signals and implemented three conventional feature-based models as comparisons. A dataset of 18 patients was used to evaluate the models' performances. The results of the five-fold cross-validation show that there is a relatively high similarity between the ground-truth PSI values and the predicted PSI values of our proposed model, which outperforms the conventional models, and further, that the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is 0.9344. In addition, an ablation experiment was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the soft-thresholding module for EEG-signal processing, and a cross-subject validation was implemented to illustrate the robustness of the proposed method. In summary, the procedure is not merely feasible for estimating DoA by mimicking PSI values but also inspired us to develop a precise DoA-estimation system with more convincing assessments of anesthetization levels.

AB  - Every year, millions of patients regain consciousness during surgery and can potentially suffer from post-traumatic disorders. We recently showed that the detection of motor activity during a median nerve stimulation from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals could be used to alert the medical staff that a patient is waking up and trying to move under general anesthesia [1], [2]. In this work, we measure the accuracy and false positive rate in detecting motor imagery of several deep learning models (EEGNet, deep convolutional network and shallow convolutional network) directly trained on filtered EEG data. We compare them with efficient non-deep approaches, namely, a linear discriminant analysis based on common spatial patterns, the minimum distance to Riemannian mean algorithm applied to covariance matrices, a logistic regression based on a tangent space projection of covariance matrices (TS+LR). The EEGNet improves significantly the classification performance comparing to other classifiers (p-value < 0.01); moreover it outperforms the best non-deep classifier (TS+LR) for 7.2% of accuracy. This approach promises to improve intraoperative awareness detection during general anesthesia.

TI  - Feasibility of sedation on demand in Taiwan using water exchange and air insufflation: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aim Completion of colonoscopy without sedation eliminates sedation cost and complications. Reported in the United States and Europe, on-demand sedation is not routine practice in Taiwan. Water exchange (WE), characterized by infusion and nearly complete removal of infused water during insertion, reduces insertion pain compared to air insufflation (AI) during colonoscopy. We evaluated the feasibility of on-demand sedation in Taiwan. In a randomized controlled trial of WE vs AI colonoscopy, we also aimed to determine if WE augmented the implementation by reducing insertion pain and decreasing sedation requirement. Methods This prospective patient-blinded study randomized patients to AI or WE (75 patients/group) to aid insertion. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients completing without sedation. Results In the AI and WE groups, 76.0% and 93.3% (P = 0.006) completed without need for sedation, respectively. The WE group had lower insertion pain score (mean [SD]) (4.0 [2.9] vs 2.1 [2.6], P < 0.001), lower doses of propofol (25.7 [52.7] mg vs 9.1 [35.6] mg, P = 0.012), and less time in the recovery room (3.4 [7.4] vs 1.5 [5.5], P = 0.027) than the AI group. Patient satisfaction scores and willingness to repeat if needed in the future were similar. Conclusion On-demand sedation was feasible in Taiwan. The completion rate without sedation was high in patients (76.0% with standard AI) open to the option (no prior intent to receive the standard of full or minimal sedation). WE augmented the implementation by reducing insertion pain and decreasing sedation requirement without adversely affecting patient satisfaction or willingness to repeat.

AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The method involves receiving an                electroencephalography (EEG) signal from a sensor                electrode attached to a patient. The EEG signal                comprises multiple channels. The EEG signal is                segmented (212) into smaller epochs for each                channel. The features of the EEG signal are                extracted (214) in each epoch. A median of features                (216) among multiple channels is determined for                each epoch. A probabilistic estimate of a patient                sedation is determined by a classifier. A sedation                level estimate is generated using a determined                correlation. The sedation level estimate comprises                a continuous sedation score. An indication of the                sedation level estimate is displayed.

TI  - Development of a prediction model for hypotension after induction of anesthesia using machine learning
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arterial hypotension during the early phase of anesthesia can lead to adverse outcomes such as a prolonged postoperative stay or even death. Predicting hypotension during anesthesia induction is complicated by its diverse causes. We investigated the feasibility of developing a machine-learning model to predict postinduction hypotension. Naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and artificial neural network models were trained to predict postinduction hypotension, occurring between tracheal intubation and incision, using data for the period from between the start of anesthesia induction and immediately before tracheal intubation obtained from an anesthesia monitor, a drug administration infusion pump, an anesthesia machine, and from patients' demographics, together with preexisting disease information from electronic health records. Among 222 patients, 126 developed postinduction hypotension. The random-forest model showed the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.842 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.736-0.948). This was higher than that for the Naive Bayes (0.778; 95% CI: 0.65-0.898), logistic regression (0.756; 95% CI: 0.630-0.881), and artificial-neural-network (0.760; 95% CI: 0.640-0.880) models. The most important features affecting the accuracy of machine-learning prediction were a patient's lowest systolic blood pressure, lowest mean blood pressure, and mean systolic blood pressure before tracheal intubation. We found that machine-learning models using data obtained from various anesthesia machines between the start of anesthesia induction and immediately before tracheal intubation can predict hypotension occurring during the period between tracheal intubation and incision.

TI  - Evaluation of the impact of assistive artificial intelligence on ultrasound scanning for regional anaesthesia.
T2  - British journal of anaesthesia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia relies on the visualisation of key landmark, target, and safety structures on ultrasound. However, this can be challenging, particularly for inexperienced practitioners. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being applied to medical image interpretation, including ultrasound. In this exploratory study, we evaluated ultrasound scanning performance by non-experts in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia, with and without the use of an assistive AI device.METHODS: Twenty-one anaesthetists, all non-experts in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia, underwent a standardised teaching session in ultrasound scanning for six peripheral nerve blocks. All then performed a scan for each block; half of the scans were performed with AI assistance and half without. Experts assessed acquisition of the correct block view and correct identification of sono-anatomical structures on each view. Participants reported scan confidence, experts provided a global rating score of scan performance, and scans were timed.RESULTS: Experts assessed 126 ultrasound scans. Participants acquired the correct block view in 56/62 (90.3%) scans with the device compared with 47/62 (75.1%) without (P=0.031, two data points lost). Correct identification of sono-anatomical structures on the view was 188/212 (88.8%) with the device compared with 161/208 (77.4%) without (P=0.002). There was no significant overall difference in participant confidence, expert global performance score, or scan time.CONCLUSIONS: Use of an assistive AI device was associated with improved ultrasound image acquisition and interpretation. Such technology holds potential to augment performance of ultrasound scanning for regional anaesthesia by non-experts, potentially expanding patient access to these techniques.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05156099.

TI  - SCH: INT: New Machine Learning Framework to Conduct Anesthesia Risk Stratification and Decision Support for Precision Health
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - With advances in anesthesia techniques, surgery has become increasingly applicable to a wider range of diseases and patients. Worldwide more than 230 million major surgical procedures are carried out each year. In terms of patient safety and medical economics, an important issue is how to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications and mortality. At least half of postoperative complications can be prevented, while improvements in anesthesia-associated factors contribute greatly to the prevention of complications. Anesthesia information management system is a specialized type of electronic health record that allow the automatic and reliable collection and storage of patient data during the perioperative period. The electronic anesthesia data not only provide a rich data set to assist both anesthesia providers and hospitals with their goals to improve patient safety during the fast-paced intra-operative period, but also capture detailed data to allow end users to access information for management, quality assurance, and research purposes. This project addresses the computational challenges in large-scale electronic anesthesia data mining, develops and validates an automated anesthesia risk prediction and decision support system to identify risk factors and detect patients at risk of postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality. <br/><br/>This project develops novel large-scale machine learning framework to integrate the emerging key computational techniques, such as semi-supervised generative adversarial learning, interpretable deep learning, large-scale optimization, and unsupervised hashing, to analyze large-scale electronic anesthesia data for enhancing anesthesia risk stratification and improving the quality of care for precision health. Specifically, the PIs investigate: 1) new computational tools to automate electronic anesthesia data processing, 2) novel semi-supervised generative adversarial network for anesthesia risk stratification, 3) interpretable deep learning model for clinical markers discovery, 4) scale up deep learning models for big data computation via new large-scale optimization algorithms, 5) new unsupervised deep generative adversarial hashing network for fast and accurate clinical case retrieval, and 6) evaluate the proposed methods and system using real large-scale anesthesia data. It is innovative to integrate large-scale machine learning and data-intensive computing for electronic anesthesia data mining that holds great promise for predicting postoperative outcomes using the comprehensive preoperative and intra-operative patient profiles. The developed methods and tools impact other public health research and enable investigators working on electronic health data to effectively test risk prediction hypothesis. This project facilitates the development of novel educational tools to enhance several current courses at University of Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

TI  - Machine learning for infection risk prediction in postoperative patients with non-mechanical ventilation and intravenous neurotargeted drugs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drug efficacy can be improved by understanding the effects of anesthesia on the neurovascular system. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of infection in postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) patients who are on non-mechanical ventilation and are receiving hydromorphone analgesia. In this retrospective study, 130 patients were divided into high and low dose groups of hydromorphone analgesic pump patients admitted after surgery. The white blood cells (WBC) count and incidence rate of infection was significantly higher in the high hydromorphone dosage group compared to the low hydromorphone dosage groups (p < 0.05). Furthermore, significant differences in age (P = 0.006), body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.001), WBC count (P = 0.019), C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.038), hydromorphone dosage (P = 0.014), and biological sex (P = 0.024) were seen between the infected and non-infected groups. The infected group also had a longer hospital stay and an extended stay in the intensive care unit compared to the non-infected group. We identified important risk factors for the development of postoperative infections by using machine learning algorithms, including hydromorphone dosage, age, biological sex, BMI, and WBC count. Logistic regression analysis was applied to incorporate these variables to construct infection prediction models and nomograms. The area under curves (AUC) of the model were 0.835, 0.747, and 0.818 in the training group, validation group, and overall pairwise column group, respectively. Therefore, we determined that hydromorphone dosage, age, biological sex, BMI, WBC count, and CRP are significant risk factors in developing postoperative infections.

AB  - During surgery, invasive systolic blood pressure is an important basis for doctors to judge the patient's life state, which will directly affect the security of the surgery. Accurately predict the changes of invasive systolic blood pressure during general anesthesia help to reduce the risk of surgery. In order to cope with the increasing surgical risk by fluctuations of invasive systolic blood pressure, this paper optimized and combined the traditional machine learning algorithm, and put forward a new fusion algorithm to predict the invasive systolic blood pressure after general anesthesia. In the modeling process, the patients' basic physical conditions, disease status, and intraoperative data collected by monitoring instrument during the surgical preparation stage were used as characteristic variable. In this paper, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression were used to establish the new fusion algorithm. When the absolute error within 15mmHg, the fusion algorithm's predicting accuracy of invasive systolic blood pressure after general anesthesia reached 91.5%. The accurate prediction of invasive systolic blood pressure after general anesthesia in the preparation stage provides sufficient time for doctors to respond and reduces the risk of surgery to a certain extent.

TI  - Method for presenting information related to            patient surgery, involves inputting third            modality-specific dataset comprising patient vital            statistics into selected single encoded neural network            to generate predictive model
AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The method involves identifying a first                modality-specific dataset. The first                modality-specific dataset comprises patient data. A                second modality-specific dataset is identified. The                second modality-specific dataset comprises multiple                chronological surgical decisions (107). A neural                network is encoded for each surgical decision in                the second dataset and with an entire first dataset                such that multiple neural networks are encoded for                the entire chronological surgical decisions                relating to a medical procedure. A single encoded                neural network is selected in multiple neural                networks. A third modality-specific dataset                comprising a patient vital statistics (103) is                input into the selected single encoded neural                network to generate a predictive model (112). The                predictive model is transmitted to a display. A                representation of the predictive model is                displayed.
                    USE - Method for presenting information such as                ongoing cost, procedural risk, predictive allergy                or health concern, life expectancy, anesthesiology                timeline, time for patient to awake, surgical                procedure timeline, medical fraud analysis and next                suggested procedure related to patient surgery                using computing device (claimed).
                    ADVANTAGE - The secure method is provided for                interchanging data from different servers and                medical devices using a secure blockchain                communication method. The actual surgery time is                decreased, because a procedural guideline with                associated risks is displayed to the surgeon as                opposed to searching for a small detail about the                patient. The amount of time in each section of the                surgery and the cost associated with each section                are predicted. The possible risks that are not                known about the patient are identified by the                surgeon. The wireless connectivity such as                Bluetooth can portably move anesthesia time on a                small wireless display as the patient leaves the                operation room. The computing device can predict                dosage sizes for certain medications at certain                times throughout the surgery given by the matching                historical data of other patient. The need for                doctor notes is eliminated. The combination of                surgical data, patient data, and patient hereditary                data are used to predict blood clots and to provide                surgical decisions.

TI  - Differentiating propofol-induced altered states of consciousness using features of EEG microstates
T2  - BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: In this study, we comprehensively studied alternations of EEG microstates in resting state, light, and deep level of propofol-induced unconsciousness. We further investigated the feasibility of using microstate features for differentiating different consciousness levels.Methods: 60-channel EEG was recorded from 31 male subjects in resting, light, and deep anesthesia states. Microstate analysis was performed on each consciousness levels separately. We first identified the optimal number of microstate templates for each consciousness levels and aligned them based on spatial similarity. Then, we extracted features including duration, coverage, and occurrence. Machine learning models including SVM, LDA and Random Forest were employed to classify different consciousness levels using microstate features. Finally, the cortical source of each microstates was analyzed using standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography.Results: We found that the optimal number of microstates differed in different consciousness levels. 7 common and 2 anesthesia-specific microstates were identified. M4, M5, M1 and M2 were similar to the canonical microstates A to D. Occurrence of M6 and duration of M1, M5 and M7 monotonically decreased with increasing level of consciousness suppression. All three features of the anesthesia-specific microstate M8 significantly decreased with increasing level of anesthesia. The classifiers using microstate features showed a mean accuracy of 85.6% to classify three consciousness levels.Conclusion: EEG microstate features significantly altered during propofol-induced unconsciousness, and can be used to distinguish between consciousness levels.Significance: Microstate analysis may be a useful tool in deciphering the neural mechanism of propofol-induced anesthesia and provide useful features for quantifying levels of consciousness.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. This study aimed to present an investigation of the clinical significance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images obtained based on the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) artificial intelligence algorithm for hip arthroplasty under general anesthesia. Methods. In this study, a case-review method was used to collect 100 patients requiring total hip replacement. They were then randomly divided into an observation group and a control group. Based on the neural network algorithm, the images of the two groups of patients were analyzed to judge their accuracy. Then the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRI images based on neural algorithms were compared with those processed by radiologists. Results. It was found that MRI processed by BP neural network had good accuracy in the diagnosis of hip joint diseases compared with CT. Meanwhile, the images processed by BP neural network had good specificity and accuracy compared with the images processed by radiologists. Conclusion. Imaging images obtained by BPNN artificial intelligence algorithm were more accurate than CT images, which had more guiding value for surgeons in operation.

TI  - Machine Learning Based Hardware Architecture for DOA Measurement From Mice EEG
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This research aims to design a hardware optimized machine learning based Depth of Anesthesia (DOA) measurement framework for mice and its FPGA implementation. Methods: Electroencephalography or EEG signal is acquired from 16 mice in the Neural Interface Research (NIR) Laboratory of the City University of Hong Kong. We present a logistic regression based approach with mathematically uncomplicated feature extraction techniques for efficient hardware implementation to estimate the DOA. Results: With the extraction of only two features, the proposed system can classify the state of consciousness with 94% accuracy for a 1 second EEG epoch, leading to a 100% accurate channel prediction after a 7 s run-time on average. Conclusion: Through performance evaluation and comparative study confirmed the efficacy of the prototype. Significance: DOA is the measure of consciousness to distinguish whether a patient is suitably anesthetized or not during a surgical procedure. Traditionally the DOA is estimated by checking biophysical responses of a patient during the surgery. However, the physical symptoms can be misleading for a decisive conclusion due to the patient's health condition or as a side-effect of anesthetic drugs. Recently, several neuroscientific research works are correlating the EEG signal with conscious states, which is likely to have less interference with the patient's medical condition. This research presents the first-of-its-kind hardware implemented automatic DOA computation system for mice.

TI  - Machine learning of EEG spectra classifies unconsciousness during GABAergic anesthesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In current anesthesiology practice, anesthesiologists infer the state of unconsciousness without directly monitoring the brain. Drug- and patient-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness have been identified previously. We applied machine learning approaches to construct classification models for real-time tracking of unconscious state during anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. We used cross-validation to select and train the best performing models using 33,159 2s segments of EEG data recorded from 7 healthy volunteers who received increasing infusions of propofol while responding to stimuli to directly assess unconsciousness. Cross-validated models of unconsciousness performed very well when tested on 13,929 2s EEG segments from 3 left-out volunteers collected under the same conditions (median volunteer AUCs 0.99-0.99). Models showed strong generalization when tested on a cohort of 27 surgical patients receiving solely propofol collected in a separate clinical dataset under different circumstances and using different hardware (median patient AUCs 0.95-0.98), with model predictions corresponding with actions taken by the anesthesiologist during the cases. Performance was also strong for 17 patients receiving sevoflurane (alone or in addition to propofol) (median AUCs 0.88-0.92). These results indicate that EEG spectral features can predict unconsciousness, even when tested on a different anesthetic that acts with a similar neural mechanism. With high performance predictions of unconsciousness, we can accurately monitor anesthetic state, and this approach may be used to engineer infusion pumps to intelligibly respond to patients' neural activity.

TI  - Detection of EEG burst-suppression in neurocritical care patients using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The burst suppression pattern in clinical electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings is an important diagnostic tool because of its association with comas of various etiologies, as with hypoxia, drug related intoxication or deep anesthesia. The detection of bursts and the calculation of burst/suppres-sion ratio are often used to monitor the level of anesthesia during treatment of status epilepticus. However, manual counting of bursts is a laborious process open to inter-rater variation and motivates a need for automatic detection. METHODS: We describe a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that detects bursts in EEG and generates burst-per-minute estimates for the purpose of monitoring sedation level in an intensive care unit (ICU). We validated the algorithm on 29 hours of burst annotated EEG data from 29 patients suffering from status epilepticus and hemorrhage. RESULTS: We report competitive results in comparison to neural networks learned via supervised learning. The mean absolute error (SD) in bursts per minute was 0.93 (1.38). CONCLUSION: We present a novel burst suppression detection algorithm that adapts to each patient individually, reports bursts-per-minute quickly, and does not require manual fine-tuning unlike previous approaches to burst-suppression pattern detection. SIGNIFICANCE: Our algorithm for automatic burst suppression quantification can greatly reduce manual oversight in depth of sedation monitoring.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Pain assessment represents the first fundamental stage for proper pain management, but currently, methods applied in clinical practice often lack in providing a satisfying characterization of the pain experience. Automatic methods based on the analysis of physiological signals (e.g., photoplethysmography, electrodermal activity) promise to overcome these limitations, also providing the possibility to record these signals through wearable devices, thus capturing the physiological response in everyday life. After applying preprocessing, feature extraction and feature selection methods, we tested several machine learning algorithms to develop an automatic classifier fed with physiological signals recorded in real-world contexts and pain ratings from 21 cancer patients. The best algorithm achieved up to 72% accuracy. Although performance can be improved by enlarging the dataset, preliminary results proved the feasibility of assessing pain by using physiological signals recorded in real-world contexts.

AB  - Pain is a symptom of many disorders associated with actual or potential tissue damage in human body. Managing pain is not only a duty but also highly cost prone. The most primitive state of pain management is the assessment of pain. Traditionally it was accomplished by self-report or visual inspection by experts. However, automatic pain assessment systems from facial videos are also rapidly evolving due to the need of managing pain in a robust and cost effective way. Among different challenges of automatic pain assessment from facial video data two issues are increasingly prevalent: first, exploiting both spatial and temporal information of the face to assess pain level, and second, incorporating multiple visual modalities to capture complementary face information related to pain. Most works in the literature focus on merely exploiting spatial information on chromatic (RGB) video data on shallow learning scenarios. However, employing deep learning techniques for spatio-temporal analysis considering Depth (D) and Thermal (T) along with RGB has high potential in this area. In this paper, we present the first state-of-the-art publicly available database, 'Multimodal Intensity Pain (MIntPAIN)' database, for RGBDT pain level recognition in sequences. We provide a first baseline results including 5 pain levels recognition by analyzing independent visual modalities and their fusion with CNN and LSTM models. From the experimental evaluation we observe that fusion of modalities helps to enhance recognition performance of pain levels in comparison to isolated ones. In particular, the combination of RGB, D, and T in an early fusion fashion achieved the best recognition rate.

TI  - 'Black Box' to 'Conversational' Machine Learning: Ondansetron Reduces Risk of Hospital-Acquired Venous Thromboembolism
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning, combined with a proliferation of electronic healthcare records (EHR), has the potential to transform medicine by identifying previously unknown interventions that reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. To realize this potential, machine learning must leave the conceptual 'black box' in complex domains to overcome several pitfalls, like the presence of confounding variables. These variables predict outcomes but are not causal, often yielding uninformative models. In this work, we envision a 'conversational' approach to design machine learning models, which couple modeling decisions to domain expertise. We demonstrate this approach via a retrospective cohort study to identify factors which affect the risk of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (HA-VTE). Using logistic regression for modeling, we have identified drugs that reduce the risk of HA-VTE. Our analysis reveals that ondansetron, an anti-nausea and anti-emetic medication, commonly used in treating side-effects of chemotherapy and post-general anesthesia period, substantially reduces the risk of HA-VTE when compared to aspirin (11% vs. 15% relative risk reduction or RRR, respectively). The low cost and low morbidity of ondansetron may justify further inquiry into its use as a preventative agent for HA-VTE. This case study highlights the importance of engaging domain expertise while applying machine learning in complex domains.

TI  - Virtual Reality meets Artificial Intelligence: The Emergence of Advanced Digital Therapeutics and Digital Biomarkers
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF CYBERTHERAPY AND TELEMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past 25 years, researchers have discovered that Virtual Reality (VR) is an effective tool for mental health treatment and assessment in anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. Moreover, VR is also an effective assessment tool with practical applications that range from social and cognitive deficits to addiction. Nevertheless, despite progress, evidence-based psychological treatments still need improvement. In this paper we suggest that the integration of VR with another emerging technology - Artificial Intelligence (AI) - will provide clinicians with two new powerful tools for improving evidence-based psychological treatments: advanced digital therapeutics and digital biomarkers. The term "Digital Therapeutics" indicates the use of digital/online health technologies to treat a medical or psychological condition. Following this definition, any VR clinical application can be defined as a form of digital therapeutics. However, the integration between VR al Al allows a critical feature for any digital therapeutic: personalization. On one side, VR allows the collection of "Digital Biomarkers" - physiological, and behavioral data that are collected by means of digital technologies and used as an indicator of biologic processes or biological responses to therapeutic interventions - that are directly connected to the brain functioning and can be altered to correct the specific dysfunctions of the predictive coding mechanisms in the individual's brain. On the other side Al, by applying machine learning techniques to the individual's digital biomarkers, allows the optimization the individual treatment strategy facilitating the transition to a personalized, effective and engaging medicine.

AB  - Depth of anesthesia (DOA) is a very important parameter, determining how the brain responds to various concentrations of anesthetic. Here, we assess the dependence of DOA on the concentration of isoflurane by analyzing local-field potentials (LFPs) recorded in mouse visual cortex. To capture the DOA-related changes, we employed TESPAR and Fourier-based feature extraction techniques. combined with machine learning. In addition, we performed an analysis of bursts present in LFP signals and evaluated their influence on DOA classification. These bursts are characterized by high amplitudes and low frequencies, requiring different analysis approaches: one that removes the high amplitudes and the other one that filters the lower frequencies. We developed procedures that successfully discriminate between different levels of anesthesia. Our study indicates a correlation between increased isoflurane dose and LFP amplitude suppression and also indicates that large amplitude bursts are expressed in the signal in a dose-dependent manner.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in neurocritical care
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Background: Neurocritical care combines the management of extremely complex disease states with the inherent limitations of clinically assessing patients with brain injury. As the management of neurocritical care patients can be immensely complicated, the automation of data-collection and basic management by artificial intelligence systems have garnered interest.Methods: In this opinion article, we highlight the potential artificial intelligence has in monitoring and managing several aspects of neurocritical care, specifically intracranial pressure, seizure monitoring, blood pressure, and ventilation.Results: The two major AI methods of analytical technique currently exist for analyzing critical care data: the model-based method and data driven method. Both of these methods have demonstrated an ability to analyze vast quantities of patient data, and we highlight the ways in which these modalities of artificial intelligence might one day play a role in neurocritical care.Conclusions: While none of these artificial intelligence systems are meant to replace the clinician's judgment, these systems have the potential to reduce healthcare costs and errors or delays in medical management.

TI  - Frontotemporal EEG to guide sedation in COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To study if limited frontotemporal electroencephalogram (EEG) can guide sedation changes in highly infectious novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agent.Methods: 98 days of continuous frontotemporal EEG from 11 consecutive patients was evaluated daily by an epileptologist to recommend reduction or maintenance of the sedative level. We evaluated the need to increase sedation in the 6 h following this recommendation. Post-hoc analysis of the quantitative EEG was correlated with the level of sedation using a machine learning algorithm.Results: Eleven patients were studied for a total of ninety-eight sedation days. EEG was consistent with excessive sedation on 57 (58%) and adequate sedation on 41 days (42%). Recommendations were followed by the team on 59% (N = 58; 19 to reduce and 39 to keep the sedation level). In the 6 h following reduction in sedation, increases of sedation were needed in 7 (12%). Automatized classification of EEG sedation levels reached 80% (+/- 17%) accuracy.Conclusions: Visual inspection of a limited EEG helped sedation depth guidance. In a secondary analysis, our data supported that this determination may be automated using quantitative EEG analysis.Significance: Our results support the use of frontotemporal EEG for guiding sedation in patients with COVID-19.

TI  - A mean field approach to model levels of consciousness from EEG recordings
T2  - JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a mean-field model for analysing the dynamics of human consciousness. In particular, inspired by the Giulio Tononi's Integrated Information Theory and by the Max Tegmark's representation of consciousness, we study order-disorder phase transitions on Curie-Weiss models generated by processing EEG signals. The latter have been recorded on healthy individuals undergoing deep sedation. Then, we implement a machine learning tool for classifying mental states using, as input, the critical temperatures computed in the Curie-Weiss models. Results show that, by the proposed method, it is possible to discriminate between states of awareness and states of deep sedation. Besides, we identify a state space for representing the path between mental states, whose dimensions correspond to critical temperatures computed over different frequency bands of the EEG signal. Beyond possible theoretical implications in the study of human consciousness, resulting from our model, we deem relevant to emphasise that the proposed method could be exploited for clinical applications.

AB  - This study investigates practice variance in performing epidural anesthesia for cesarean section. Specifically, we analyze the safety and efficacy of a large-dose, needle-based epidural technique where anesthetic dose is administered through an epidural needle prior to insertion of the epidural catheter. Using a data-driven informatics and machine learning approach, our findings show that the needle-based technique is faster and more dose-effective in achieving sensory level than the catheter based approach. We also find that injecting large doses in the epidural space through the epidural needle is safe, with complication rates similar to those reported in published literature. Further, machine learning reveals that a needle dose of at most 18 ml offers lower hypotension complication. The machine learning framework can predict hypotension incidents with 85% accuracy. The findings facilitate delivery improvement and establish an improved clinical practice guideline for training and dissemination of safe practice. Successful prediction of hypotension allows for early intervention to minimize the effects of complication. Furthermore, although almost 50% of the drug combinations used involve fentanyl, our findings show that fentanyl has little effect on the outcome and should be avoided in epidural anesthesia.

M3  - Article
AB  - Sedation is a controllable level of medication depression of consciousness during which protective reflexes, adequate breathing, and responsiveness to physical stimuli and verbal commands are retained A number of physical and psychological factors affect the psyche of patients in the intensive care unit. Central nervous system (CNS) is a primary target of action of anesthetics and analgesics, and the bi-spectral index reflects the level of sedation of CNS, regardless of what drug caused sedation. The aim of this study was to use volatile anesthetics sevoflurane and isoflurane in children for sedation in the intensive care unit. Constant use of the inhalation route of administration helps to maintain the desired level of sedation depth for the required period of time in patients who are on long-term sedation and is practical for correction.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Although advances in machine-learning healthcare applications promise great potential for innovative medical care, few data are available on the translational status of these new technologies. We aimed to provide a comprehensive characterization of the development and status quo of clinical studies in the field of machine learning. For this purpose, we performed a registry-based analysis of machine-learning-related studies that were published and first available in the ClinicalTrials.gov database until 2020, using the database's study classification. In total, n = 358 eligible studies could be included in the analysis. Of these, 82% were initiated by academic institutions/university (hospitals) and 18% by industry sponsors. A total of 96% were national and 4% international. About half of the studies (47%) had at least one recruiting location in a country in North America, followed by Europe (37%) and Asia (15%). Most of the studies reported were initiated in the medical field of imaging (12%), followed by cardiology, psychiatry, anesthesia/intensive care medicine (all 11%) and neurology (10%). Although the majority of the clinical studies were still initiated in an academic research context, the first industry-financed projects on machine-learning-based algorithms are becoming visible. The number of clinical studies with machine-learning-related applications and the variety of medical challenges addressed serve to indicate their increasing importance in future clinical care. Finally, they also set a time frame for the adjustment of medical device-related regulation and governance.

TI  - DoseFormer: Dynamic Graph Transformer for Postoperative Pain Prediction
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many patients suffer from postoperative pain after surgery, which causes discomfort and influences recovery after the operation. During surgery, the anesthetists usually rely on their own experience when anesthetizing, which is not stable for avoiding postoperative pain. Hence, it is essential to predict postoperative pain and give proper doses accordingly. Recently, the relevance of various clinical parameters and nociception has been investigated in many works, and several indices have been proposed for measuring the level of nociception. However, expensive advanced equipment is required when applying advanced medical technologies, which is not accessible to most institutions. In our work, we propose a deep learning model based on a dynamic graph transformer framework named DoseFormer to predict postoperative pain in a short period after an operation utilizing dynamic patient data recorded in existing widely utilized equipment (e.g., anesthesia monitor). DoseFormer consists of two modules: (i) We design a temporal model utilizing a long short-term memory (LSTM) model with an attention mechanism to capture dynamic intraoperative data of the patient and output a hybrid semantic embedding representing the patient information. (ii) We design a graph transformer network (GTN) to infer the postoperative pain level utilizing the relations across the patient embeddings. We evaluate the DoseFormer system with the medical records of over 999 patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery in the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The experimental results show that our model achieves 92.16% accuracy for postoperative pain prediction and has a better comprehensive performance compared with baselines.

TI  - A dual-purpose deep learning model for auscultated lung and tracheal sound analysis based on mixed set training
T2  - BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Many deep learning-based computerized respiratory sound analysis methods have previously been developed. However, these studies focus on either lung sound only or tracheal sound only. The effectiveness of using a lung sound analysis algorithm on tracheal sound and vice versa is rarely reported. Furthermore, no one knows whether using lung and tracheal sounds together in training a deep learning-based respiratory sound analysis model is beneficial. In this study, we first constructed a tracheal sound database, HF_Tracheal_V1, containing 10,448 15-s tracheal sound recordings, 21,741 inhalation labels, 15,858 exhalation labels, and 6414 continuous adventitious sound (CAS) labels collected from 227 participants undergoing a diagnostic/surgical procedure under monitored anesthesia care. HF_Tracheal_V1 and our previously built lung sound database, HF_Lung_V2, were either combined (mixed set), used one after the other (domain adaptation), or used alone to train convolutional neural network bidirectional gate recurrent unit models for inhalation, exhalation, and CAS detection in lung and tracheal sounds. The results revealed that the models trained using lung sound alone performed poorly in tracheal sound analysis and vice versa. However, mixed set training or domain adaptation improved the performance for 1) inhalation and exhalation detection in lung sounds and 2) inhalation, exhalation, and CAS detection in tracheal sounds compared to positive controls (the models trained using lung sound alone and used in lung sound analysis and vice versa). In particular, the model trained on the mixed set had great flexibility to serve two purposes, lung and tracheal sound analyses, at the same time.

TI  - The Real-Time and Patient-Specific Prediction for Duration and Recovery Profile of Cisatracurium Based on Deep Learning Models
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During general anesthesia, how to judge the patient's muscle relaxation state has always been one of the most significant issues for anesthesiologists. Train-of-four ratio (TOFR) monitoring is a standard method, which can only obtain static data to judge the current situation of muscle relaxation. Cisatracurium is a nondepolarizing benzylisoquinoline muscle relaxant. Real-time prediction of TOFR could help anesthesiologists to evaluate the duration and recovery profile of cisatracurium. TOFR of cisatracurium could be regarded as temporal sequence data, which could be processed and predicted using RNN based deep learning methods. In this work, we performed RNN, GRU, and LSTM models for TOFR prediction. We used transfer learning based on patient similarity derived from BMI and age to achieve real-time and patient-specific prediction. The GRU model achieved the best performance. In transfer learning, the model chosen based on patient similarity has significantly outperformed the model chosen randomly. Our work verified the feasibility of real-time prediction for TOFR of cisatracurium, which had practical significance in general anesthesia. Meanwhile, using the patient demographic data in transfer learning, our work could also achieve the patient-specific prediction, having theoretical value for the clinical research of precision medicine.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - In modern anesthesia, multiple medical devices are used simultaneously to comprehensively monitor real-time vital signs to optimize patient care and improve surgical outcomes. However, interpreting the dynamic changes of time-series biosignals and their correlations is a difficult task even for experienced anesthesiologists. Recent advanced machine learning technologies have shown promising results in biosignal analysis, however, research and development in this area is relatively slow due to the lack of biosignal datasets for machine learning. The VitalDB (Vital Signs DataBase) is an open dataset created specifically to facilitate machine learning studies related to monitoring vital signs in surgical patients. This dataset contains high-resolution multi-parameter data from 6,388 cases, including 486,451 waveform and numeric data tracks of 196 intraoperative monitoring parameters, 73 perioperative clinical parameters, and 34 time-series laboratory result parameters. All data is stored in the public cloud after anonymization. The dataset can be freely accessed and analysed using application programming interfaces and Python library. The VitalDB public dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for biosignal research and development.

AB  - Objective pain assessment is required for appropriate pain management in the clinical setting. However, clinical gold standard pain assessment is based on subjective methods. Automated pain detection from physiological data may provide important objective information to better standardize pain assessment. Specifically, electrodermal activity (EDA) can identify features of stress and anxiety induced by varying pain levels. However, notable variability in EDA measurement exists and research to date has demonstrated sensitivity but lack of specificity in pain assessment. In this paper, we use timescale decomposition (TSD) to extract salient features from EDA signals to identify an accurate and automated EDA pain detection algorithm to sensitively and specifically distinguish pain from no-pain conditions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate and understand pregnant patients' perspectives on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical care with a focus on opportunities to improve healthcare technologies and healthcare delivery. Materials and Methods We developed an anonymous survey and enrolled patients presenting to the labor and delivery unit at a tertiary care center September 2019-June 2020. We investigated the role and interplay of patient demographic factors, healthcare literacy, understanding of AI, comfort levels with various AI scenarios, and preferences for AI use in clinical care. Results Of the 349 parturients, 57.6% were between the ages of 25-34 years, 90.1% reported college or graduate education and 69.2% believed the benefits of AI use in clinical care outweighed the risks. Cluster analysis revealed 2 distinct groups: patients more comfortable with clinical AI use (Pro-AI) and those who preferred physician presence (AI-Cautious). Pro-AI patients had a higher degree of education, were more knowledgeable about AI use in their daily lives and saw AI use as a significant advancement in medicine. AI-Cautious patients reported a lack of human qualities and low trust in the technology as detriments to AI use. Discussion Patient trust and the preservation of the human physician-patient relationship are critical in moving forward with AI implementation in healthcare. Pregnant individuals are cautiously optimistic about AI use in their care. Conclusion Our findings provide insights into the status of AI use in perinatal care and provide a platform for driving patient-centered innovations.

TI  - Application of fuzzy learning in IoT-enabled remote healthcare monitoring and control of anesthetic depth during surgery
T2  - INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart remote patient monitoring and early disease diagnosis systems have made huge pro-gresses after the introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) con-cepts. This paper proposes an AI-enabled IoT system to monitor and adjust the depth of anesthesia via network channels. More precisely, fuzzy learning systems are employed to develop a control system for the depth of anesthesia in surgeries. This scheme is com-posed of variable structure control and adaptive type-II fuzzy systems. Therefore, the con-troller is adaptive and robust to any perturbations and disturbances that may happen during a patient's surgery. The adaptive type-II fuzzy system is designed as an intelligent online estimator to approximate patient model uncertainties. This estimation helps in boosting the performance of the variable structure control system. An artificial neuron is also designed to reduce chattering for the proposed control system. The designed control system can efficiently adjust the anesthesia drug infusion rate and regulate the Bispectral index. The networked structure of the proposed system makes remote tuning of drug infusion possible. Performance of the designed controller is evaluated on several patient models. Simulation results confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed remote drug delivery system.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Res-SE-ConvNet: A Deep Neural Network for Hypoxemia Severity Prediction for Hospital In-Patients Using Photoplethysmograph Signal
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the severity level of hypoxemia, the scarcity of saturated oxygen (SpO2) in the human body, is very important for the patients, a matter which has become even more significant during the outbreak of Covid-19 variants. Although the widespread usage of Pulse Oximeter has helped the doctors aware of the current level of SpO2 and thereby determine the hypoxemia severity of a particular patient, the high sensitivity of the device can lead to the desensitization of the care-givers, resulting in slower response to actual hypoxemia event. There has been research conducted for the detection of severity level using various parameters and bio-signals and feeding them in a machine learning algorithm. However, in this paper, we have proposed a new residual-squeeze-excitation-attention based convolutional network (Res-SE-ConvNet) using only Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal for the comfortability of the patient. Unlike the other methods, the proposed method has outperformed the standard state-of-art methods as the result shows 96.5% accuracy in determining 3 class severity problems with 0.79 Cohen Kappa score. This method has the potential to aid the patients in receiving the benefit of an automatic and faster clinical decision support system, thus handling the severity of hypoxemia.

TI  - An Interpretable Longitudinal Preeclampsia Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning.
T2  - medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Background: Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disease characterized by new onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation that affects 2-8% of all pregnancies and contributes to up to 26% of maternal deaths. Despite extensive clinical research, current predictive tools fail to identify up to 66% of patients who will develop preeclampsia. We sought to develop a tool to longitudinally predict preeclampsia risk.Methods: In this retrospective model development and validation study, we examined a large cohort of patients who delivered at six community and two tertiary care hospitals in the New England region between 02/2015 and 06/2023. We used sociodemographic, clinical diagnoses, family history, laboratory, and vital signs data. We developed eight datasets at 14, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 39 weeks gestation and at the hospital admission for delivery. We created linear regression, random forest, xgboost, and deep neural networks to develop multiple models and compared their performance. We used Shapley values to investigate the global and local explainability of the models and the relationships between the predictive variables.Findings: Our study population (N=120,752) had an incidence of preeclampsia of 5.7% (N=6,920). The performance of the models as measured using the area under the curve, AUC, was in the range 0.73-0.91, which was externally validated. The relationships between some of the variables were complex and non-linear; in addition, the relative significance of the predictors varied over the pregnancy. Compared to the current standard of care for preeclampsia risk stratification in the first trimester, our model would allow 48.6% more at-risk patients to be identified.Interpretation: Our novel preeclampsia prediction tool would allow clinicians to identify patients at risk early and provide personalized predictions, as well as longitudinal predictions throughout pregnancy.Funding: National Institutes of Health, Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation.RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence before this study: Current tools for the prediction of preeclampsia are lacking as they fail to identify up to 66% of the patients who develop preeclampsia. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Web of Science from database inception to May 1, 2023, using the keywords "deep learning", "machine learning", "preeclampsia", "artificial intelligence", "pregnancy complications", and "predictive models". We identified 13 studies that employed machine learning to develop prediction models for preeclampsia risk based on clinical variables. Among these studies, six included biomarkers such as serum placental growth factor, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, and uterine artery pulsatility index, which are not routinely available in our clinical practice; two studies were in diverse cohorts of more than 100 000 patients, and two studies developed longitudinal predictions using medical records data. However, most studies have limited depth, concerns about data leakage, overfitting, or lack of generalizability.Added value of this study: We developed a comprehensive longitudinal predictive tool based on routine clinical data that can be used throughout pregnancy to predict the risk of preeclampsia. We tested multiple types of predictive models, including machine learning and deep learning models, and demonstrated high predictive power. We investigated the changes over different time points of individual and group variables and found previously known and novel relationships between variables such as red blood cell count and preeclampsia risk.Implications of all the available evidence: Longitudinal prediction of preeclampsia using machine learning can be achieved with high performance. Implementation of an accurate predictive tool within the electronic health records can aid clinical care and identify patients at heightened risk who would benefit from aspirin prophylaxis, increased surveillance, early diagnosis, and escalation in care. These results highlight the potential of using artificial intelligence in clinical decision support, with the ultimate goal of reducing iatrogenic preterm birth and improving perinatal care.

TI  - Patient-Specific Classification of ICU Sedation Levels From Heart Rate Variability
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To develop a personalizable algorithm to discriminate between sedation levels in ICU patients based on heart rate variability.Design: Multicenter, pilot study.Setting: Several ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.Patients: We gathered 21,912 hours of routine electrocardiogram recordings from a heterogenous group of 70 adult ICU patients. All patients included in the study were mechanically ventilated and were receiving sedatives.Measurements and Main Results: As "ground truth" for developing our method, we used Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores grouped into four levels denoted "comatose" (-5), "deeply sedated" (-4 to -3), "lightly sedated" (-2 to 0), and "agitated" (+1 to +4). We trained a support vector machine learning algorithm to calculate the probability of each sedation level from heart rate variability measures derived from the electrocardiogram. To estimate algorithm performance, we calculated leave-one-subject out cross-validated accuracy. The patient-independent version of the proposed system discriminated between the four sedation levels with an overall accuracy of 59%. Upon personalizing the system supplementing the training data with patient-specific calibration data, consisting of an individual's labeled heart rate variability epochs from the preceding 24 hours, accuracy improved to 67%. The personalized system discriminated between light-and deep-sedation states with an average accuracy of 75%.Conclusions: With further refinement, the methodology reported herein could lead to a fully automated system for depth of sedation monitoring. By enabling monitoring to be continuous, such technology may help clinical staff to monitor sedation levels more effectively and to reduce complications related to over-and under sedation.

AB  - Pain is a primary symptom of diseases and an indicator of a patients' health status. Effective management of pain is important for patient treatment and well-being. There are some traditional self-reported methods for pain assessment, and automatic pain detection systems using facial expressions are developing rapidly; these offer the potential for more efficient, convenient and cost-effective pain management. In this paper, a joint deep neural network model is proposed to classify pain intensity in four categories from facial images. This study used two different Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which were pre-trained with Visual Geometric Group Face Convolutional Neural Network (VGGFace CNN) and then joined together as a network to estimate pain intensity levels. The UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain database was used to train and test the proposed algorithm. As a contribution to knowledge, this paper provides new information regarding the performance of a hybrid, joint deep learning algorithm for pain multi-classification in facial images.

TI  - Development and validation of a reinforcement learning model for ventilation control during emergence from general anesthesia
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ventilation should be assisted without asynchrony or cardiorespiratory instability during anesthesia emergence until sufficient spontaneous ventilation is recovered. In this multicenter cohort study, we develop and validate a reinforcement learning-based Artificial Intelligence model for Ventilation control during Emergence (AIVE) from general anesthesia. Ventilatory and hemodynamic parameters from 14,306 surgical cases at an academic hospital between 2016 and 2019 are used for training and internal testing of the model. The model's performance is also evaluated on the external validation cohort, which includes 406 cases from another academic hospital in 2022. The estimated reward of the model's policy is higher than that of the clinicians' policy in the internal (0.185, the 95% lower bound for best AIVE policy vs. -0.406, the 95% upper bound for clinicians' policy) and external validation (0.506, the 95% lower bound for best AIVE policy vs. 0.154, the 95% upper bound for clinicians' policy). Cardiorespiratory instability is minimized as the clinicians' ventilation matches the model's ventilation. Regarding feature importance, airway pressure is the most critical factor for ventilation control. In conclusion, the AIVE model achieves higher estimated rewards with fewer complications than clinicians' ventilation control policy during anesthesia emergence.

TI  - Assessment of sedation and cardiorespiratory variables in sheep using different anesthetic protocols during artificial insemination
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial insemination (AI) is an important technique in sheep breeding. Since it is an invasive procedure, sedation and analgesia are essential. In the present study, 75 Texel sheep, standardized for weight (kg) and age (months) were used. The animals were randomly allocated to five groups: Acepromazine Group (AG); Acepromazine and Butorphanol Group (ABG); Acepromazine and Morphine Group (AMG); Acepromazine and Meperidine Group (AMRG) and Saline group (SG). The following parameters were assessed: sedation score, agitation level, heart rate (HR); respiratory rate (f), rectal temperature (T degrees R), latency time and time to perform artificial insemination (AI). Assessments times were M-20, M0, M1 and M2. Significant differences were considered when p.0.05. There were no significant differences for weight and age. HR increased by 30.6, 34.2 and 42.5% from M-20 to M2 for the AG, ABG and AMRG, respectively. At M0, the AMRG obtained higher values, reaching 41.4% above the other groups. For f there was a decline of 21.8 and 26.9% in M1 in relation to M-20 for the AMRG and AMG, respectively, and a decrease of 20 and 25% between M-20 and M2. A comparison between SG f values showed an increase of 106.3 and 68.8% between M-20 and M1 and M2, respectively. The f values obtained at M1 and M2 for the SG were higher than those of the other groups. Although there were no intergroup differences in sedation level, the values obtained are clinically relevant. There were intergroup differences in agitation level, whereby at M1, AMRG and AMG obtained a score of 2 and SG 0, while at M2, AMG scored 2 and SG 0. There were no statistical differences for latency and AI times. Thus, under the conditions of the present study, the AMRG protocol was the least safe among the options assessed. The pre-anesthetic medication protocols promoted mild sedation and did not reduce the time required for AI.

TI  - Could Artificial Intelligence Prevent Intraoperative Anaphylaxis? Reference Review and Proof of Concept
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Drugs and various medical substances have been used for many decades to diagnose or treat diseases. Procedures like surgery and anesthesia (either local or general) use different pharmacological products during these events. In most of the cases, the procedure is safe and the physician performs the technique without incidents. Although they are safe for use, these substances (including drugs) may have adverse effects, varying from mild ones to life-threatening reactions in a minority of patients. Artificial intelligence may be a useful tool in approximating the risk of anaphylaxis before undertaking a medical procedure. This material presents these undesirable responses produced by medical products from a multidisciplinary point of view. Moreover, we present a proof of concept for using artificial intelligence as a possible guardship against intraoperative anaphylaxis.

TI  - Selection of the Best Electroencephalogram Channel to Predict the Depth of Anesthesia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise cerebral dynamics of action of the anesthetics are a challenge for neuroscientists. This explains why there is no gold standard for monitoring the Depth of Anesthesia (DoA) and why experimental studies may use several electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, ranging from 2 to 128 EEG-channels. Our study aimed at finding the scalp area providing valuable information about brain activity under general anesthesia (GA) to select the more optimal EEG channel to characterized the DoA. We included 30 patients undergoing elective, minor surgery under GA and used a 32-channel EEG to record their electrical brain activity. In addition, we recorded their physiological parameters and the BIS monitor. Each individual EEG channel data were processed to test their ability to differentiate awake from asleep states. Due to strict quality criteria adopted for the EEG data and the difficulties of the real-life setting of the study, only 8 patients recordings were taken into consideration in the final analysis. Using 2 classification algorithms, we identified the optimal channels to discriminate between asleep and awake states: the frontal and temporal F8 and T7 were retrieved as being the two bests channels to monitor DoA. Then, using only data from the F8 channel, we tried to minimize the number of features required to discriminate between the awake and asleep state. The best algorithm turned out to be the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) requiring only 5 features (Area Under the ROC Curve - AUC- of 0.93 +/- 0.04). This finding may pave the way to improve the assessment of DoA by combining one EEG channel recordings with a multimodal physiological monitoring of the brain state under GA. Further work is needed to see if these results may be valid to asses the depth of sedation in ICU.

TI  - A Piezoelectric Force Sensing and Gesture Monitoring-Based Technique for Acupuncture Quantification
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Acupuncture is one of the most significant therapies of Chinese traditional medical science, and it is now globally utilized for diverse treatments, e.g., pain management. Traditionally, there is no quantification means for storing masters' skills and examining trainee's learning effect, hence, strongly limiting the development of acupuncture. For addressing this issue, in this article, a piezoelectric glove based wearable stress sensing technique is presented. Experimental results showcase that through the piezoelectric force-sensing glove, key parameters (e.g., peak stress at needle) during performing acupuncture are detected and extracted. Simultaneously, the Leap Motion, as a finger gesture monitoring technique, is utilized to capture the finger motion during acupuncture, allowing trainees to have a straightforward understanding of how gesture details are correlated to the stress information. The technique presented in this article potentially improves the learning efficiency of trainees and therefore advancing the progress of acupuncture.

TI  - The depth of anesthesia under sevoflurane can be monitored based on calling names language paradigm and Ag/AgCl electrooculogram electrode
T2  - MATERIALS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the depth of anesthesia monitoring, electrooculogram is usually treated as an artifact of EEG. However, the amplitude of the electrooculogram is much greater than that of electroencephalography. Its requirements for electrode materials and detection circuits are also far lower than electroencephalography. In this prospec-IP: 2038 10920 On: Mon 23 Jan 2023 06:42:21 tive cohort study, we use a new languae paradigm that licited rhythmic ocular muscle activity to explore Copyrigh : American Scentific Publishers whether the electrooculogram can be used for monitorinthe depth of anesthesia. Thirty-three patients Delivered by Ing enta inhaled sevoflurane via a laryngeal mask for induction of anesthesia. According to the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration, patients were studied under three depth of sedation. Throughout all periods, the rhythmic calling of the patient's own name script was sporadically played at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. We found that the electrooculogram was synchronized to the language paradigm during induction with sevoflurane, and the Ag/AgCl electrode has a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio and 0.5 hz spectral peak value than other electrode. With the increase in the sevoflurane concentration, the synchronizing ability gradually weak-ened and eventually disappeared. Based on this evidence, we proposed a new method that can improve the performance of the anesthesia prediction monitoring model.

TI  - A Digital Therapeutic for Pain Relief through AI-Guided Visual Stimulation
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARYDandelion™ was founded in 2020 to develop digital therapeutics for neurologic and psychiatric disorders byinteracting with the brain via the eyes. The goal of this SBIR is to design and test a safe, effective, and non-addictive pain-relief digital therapeutic in the form of visual stimuli. The platform will use artificial intelligence(AI) and real-time biofeedback to “read” (decipher) brain signals and “write” to (neuromodulate) the brain withrapid-changing visual stimuli composed of optimized patterns, colors, and frequencies. This is the first attemptto use AI-guided visual stimuli as a treatment for pain. In 2017, 11 million of the 191 million prescriptionswritten for opioid pain medications were misused, and 35% of opioid-related deaths (nearly 17,000 cases)were connected to these prescriptions. In the search for safe, effective alternatives, a range of opioid-sparinginterventions have been developed through pharmacologic, clinical, and digitized behavioral platforms butnone has proved fully successful. Dandelion hypothesizes that the complexity and variability of pain demandsa therapeutic approach that mimics the way the brain itself processes and integrates data for pain perception.Through its novel neuromodulatory platform, using artificial intelligence to parameterize potentially useful visualinformation, Dandelion will develop a safe, low-cost digital therapeutic that patients can view on a smartphoneor tablet for immediate pain relief. By correlating stimulus with response across different types of pain,Dandelion also hopes to build a pain-perception map of wider applicability. In Phase I a prototype AI-guidedplatform will be developed that can synthesize novel stimulation combinations and optimize them based onfeedback from an array of biosensors; their efficacy in reducing the perception of induced pain will then betested in healthy subjects. In Phase II, Dandelion will develop the prototype into a commercially availableproduct and test the pain-relief digital therapeutic for efficacy and generalizability in randomized controlledtrials. The commercial opportunity is estimated to be $5.9 billion.

TI  - Mapping general anesthesia states based on electro-encephalogram transition phases
T2  - NEUROIMAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cortical electro-encephalography (EEG) served as the clinical reference for monitoring unconsciousness during general anesthesia. The existing EEG-based monitors classified general anesthesia states as underdosed, adequate, or overdosed, lacking predictive power due to the absence of transition phases among these states. In response to this limitation, we undertook an analysis of the EEG signal during isoflurane-induced general anesthesia in mice. Adopting a data-driven approach, we applied signal processing techniques to track 0-and 6-band dynamics, along with iso-electric suppressions. Combining this approach with machine learning, we successfully developed an automated algorithm. The findings of our study revealed that the dampening of the 6-band occurred several minutes before the onset of significant iso-electric suppression episodes. Furthermore, a distinct y-frequency oscillation was observed, persisting for several minutes during the recovery phase subsequent to isoflurane-induced overdose. As a result of our research, we generated a map summarizing multiple brain states and their transitions, offering a tool for predicting and preventing overdose during general anesthesia. The transition phases identified, along with the developed algorithm, have the potential to be generalized, enabling clinicians to prevent inadequate anesthesia and, consequently, tailor anesthetic regimens to individual patients.

TI  - Neurotransmitter networks in mouse prefrontal cortex are reconfigured by isoflurane anesthesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study quantified eight small-molecule neurotransmitters collected simultaneously from prefrontal cortex of C57BL/6J mice (n = 23) during wakefulness and during isoflurane anesthesia (1.3%). Using isoflurane anesthesia as an independent variable enabled evaluation of the hypothesis that isoflurane anesthesia differentially alters concentrations of multiple neurotransmitters and their interactions. Machine learning was applied to reveal higher order interactions among neurotransmitters. Using a between-subjects design. microdialysis was performed during wakefulness and during anesthesia. Concentrations (nM) of acetylcholine, adenosine, dopamine. GABA, glutamate, histamine. norepinephrine, and serotonin in the dialysis samples are reported (means +/- SD). Relative to wakefulness, acetylcholine concentration was lower during isoflurane anesthesia (1.254 +/- 1.118 vs. 0.401 +/- 0.134, P = 0.009), and concentrations of adenosine (29.456 +/- 29.756 vs. 101.321 +/- 38.603, P < 0.001). dopamine (0.0578 +/- 0.0384 vs. 0.113 +/- 0.084, P = 0.036), and norepinephrine (0.126 +/- 0.080 vs. 0.219 +/- 0.066, P = 0.010) were higher during anesthesia. Isoflurane reconfigured neurotransmitter interactions in prefrontal cortex, and the state of isoflurane anesthesia was reliably predicted by prefrontal cortex concentrations of adenosine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. A novel finding to emerge from machine learning analyses is that neurotransmitter concentration profiles in mouse prefrontal cortex undergo functional reconfiguration during isoflurane anesthesia. Adenosine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine showed high feature importance, supporting the interpretation that interactions among these three transmitters may play a key role in modulating levels of cortical and behavioral arousal.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study discovered that interactions between neurotransmitters in mouse prefrontal cortex were altered during isoflurane anesthesia relative to wakefulness. Machine learning further demonstrated that, relative to wakefulness, higher order interactions among neurotransmitters were disrupted during isoflurane administration. These findings extend to the neurochemical domain the concept that anesthetic-induced loss of wakefulness results from a disruption of neural network connectivity.

TI  - Neural Network Classifier for Automatic Detection of Invasive Versus Noninvasive Airway Management Technique Based on Respiratory Monitoring Parameters in a Pediatric Anesthesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Children undergoing general anesthesia require airway monitoring by an anesthesia provider. The airway may be supported with noninvasive devices such as face mask or invasive devices such as a laryngeal mask airway or an endotracheal tube. The physiologic data stored provides an opportunity to apply machine learning algorithms distinguish between these modes based on pattern recognition. We retrieved three data sets from patients receiving general anesthesia in 2015 with either mask, laryngeal mask airway or endotracheal tube. Patients underwent myringotomy, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy or inguinal hernia repair procedures. We retrieved measurements for end-tidal carbon dioxide, tidal volume, and peak inspiratory pressure and calculated statistical features for each data element per patient. We applied machine learning algorithms (decision tree, support vector machine, and neural network) to classify patients into noninvasive or invasive airway device support. We identified 300 patients per group (mask, laryngeal mask airway, and endotracheal tube) for a total of 900 patients. The neural network classifier performed better than the boosted trees and support vector machine classifiers based on the test data sets. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for neural network classification are 97.5%, 96.3%, and 95.8%. In contrast, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of support vector machine are 89.1%, 92.3%, and 88.3% and with the boosted tree classifier they are 93.8%, 92.1%, and 91.4%. We describe a method to automatically distinguish between noninvasive and invasive airway device support in a pediatric surgical setting based on respiratory monitoring parameters. The results show that the neural network classifier algorithm can accurately classify noninvasive and invasive airway device support.

TI  - Derivation and Validation of Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Acute Kidney Injury after Cardiac Surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning approaches were introduced for better or comparable predictive ability than statistical analysis to predict postoperative outcomes. We sought to compare the performance of machine learning approaches with that of logistic regression analysis to predict acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery. We retrospectively reviewed 2010 patients who underwent open heart surgery and thoracic aortic surgery. Baseline medical condition, intraoperative anesthesia, and surgery-related data were obtained. The primary outcome was postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The following machine learning techniques were used: decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, neural network classifier, and deep learning. The performance of these techniques was compared with that of logistic regression analysis regarding the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). During the first postoperative week, AKI occurred in 770 patients (38.3%). The best performance regarding AUC was achieved by the gradient boosting machine to predict the AKI of all stages (0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75-0.80) or stage 2 or 3 AKI. The AUC of logistic regression analysis was 0.69 (95% CI 0.66-0.72). Decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine showed similar performance to logistic regression. In our comprehensive comparison of machine learning approaches with logistic regression analysis, gradient boosting technique showed the best performance with the highest AUC and lower error rate. We developed an Internet-based risk estimator which could be used for real-time processing of patient data to estimate the risk of AKI at the end of surgery.

TI  - Predicting Prolonged Apnea During Nurse-Administered Procedural Sedation: Machine Learning Study.
T2  - JMIR perioperative medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Capnography is commonly used for nurse-administered procedural sedation. Distinguishing between capnography waveform abnormalities that signal the need for clinical intervention for an event and those that do not indicate the need for intervention is essential for the successful implementation of this technology into practice. It is possible that capnography alarm management may be improved by using machine learning to create a "smart alarm" that can alert clinicians to apneic events that are predicted to be prolonged.OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of machine learning models for predicting at the 15-second time point if apnea will be prolonged (ie, apnea that persists for >30 seconds).METHODS: A secondary analysis of an observational study was conducted. We selected several candidate models to evaluate, including a random forest model, generalized linear model (logistic regression), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, ridge regression, and the XGBoost model. Out-of-sample accuracy of the models was calculated using 10-fold cross-validation. The net benefit decision analytic measure was used to assist with deciding whether using the models in practice would lead to better outcomes on average than using the current default capnography alarm management strategies. The default strategies are the aggressive approach, in which an alarm is triggered after brief periods of apnea (typically 15 seconds) and the conservative approach, in which an alarm is triggered for only prolonged periods of apnea (typically >30 seconds).RESULTS: A total of 384 apneic events longer than 15 seconds were observed in 61 of the 102 patients (59.8%) who participated in the observational study. Nearly half of the apneic events (180/384, 46.9%) were prolonged. The random forest model performed the best in terms of discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.66) and calibration. The net benefit associated with the random forest model exceeded that associated with the aggressive strategy but was lower than that associated with the conservative strategy.CONCLUSIONS: Decision curve analysis indicated that using a random forest model would lead to a better outcome for capnography alarm management than using an aggressive strategy in which alarms are triggered after 15 seconds of apnea. The model would not be superior to the conservative strategy in which alarms are only triggered after 30 seconds.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, research has been conducted to automatically control anesthesia using machine learning, with the aim of alleviating the shortage of anesthesiologists. In this study, we address the problem of predicting decisions made by anesthesiologists during surgery using machine learning; specifically, we formulate a decision making problem by increasing the flow rate at each time point in the continuous administration of analgesic remifentanil as a supervised binary classification problem. The experiments were conducted to evaluate the prediction performance using six machine learning models: logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, LightGBM, artificial neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM), using 210 case data collected during actual surgeries. The results demonstrated that when predicting the future increase in flow rate of remifentanil after 1 min, the model using LSTM was able to predict with scores of 0.659 for sensitivity, 0.732 for specificity, and 0.753 for ROC-AUC; this demonstrates the potential to predict the decisions made by anesthesiologists using machine learning. Furthermore, we examined the importance and contribution of the features of each model using Shapley additive explanations-a method for interpreting predictions made by machine learning models. The trends indicated by the results were partially consistent with known clinical findings.

TI  - Integrating ECG Monitoring and Classification via IoT and Deep Neural Networks
T2  - BIOSENSORS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Anesthesia assessment is most important during surgery. Anesthesiologists use electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to assess the patient's condition and give appropriate medications. However, it is not easy to interpret the ECG signals. Even physicians with more than 10 years of clinical experience may still misjudge. Therefore, this study uses convolutional neural networks to classify ECG image types to assist in anesthesia assessment. The research uses Internet of Things (IoT) technology to develop ECG signal measurement prototypes. At the same time, it classifies signal types through deep neural networks, divided into QRS widening, sinus rhythm, ST depression, and ST elevation. Three models, ResNet, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet, are developed with 50% of the training set and test set. Finally, the accuracy and kappa statistics of ResNet, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet in ECG waveform classification were (0.97, 0.96), (0.96, 0.95), and (0.75, 0.67), respectively. This research shows that it is feasible to measure ECG in real time through IoT and then distinguish four types through deep neural network models. In the future, more types of ECG images will be added, which can improve the real-time classification practicality of the deep model.

TI  - Finding the best trade-off between performance and interpretability in predicting hospital length of stay using structured and unstructured data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThis study aims to develop high-performing Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in predicting hospital length of stay (LOS) while enhancing interpretability. We compare performance and interpretability of models trained only on structured tabular data with models trained only on unstructured clinical text data, and on mixed data.MethodsThe structured data was used to train fourteen classical Machine Learning models including advanced ensemble trees, neural networks and k-nearest neighbors. The unstructured data was used to fine-tune a pre-trained Bio Clinical BERT Transformer Deep Learning model. The structured and unstructured data were then merged into a tabular dataset after vectorization of the clinical text and a dimensional reduction through Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The study used the free and publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database, on the open AutoML Library AutoGluon. Performance is evaluated with respect to two types of random classifiers, used as baselines.ResultsThe best model from structured data demonstrates high performance (ROC AUC = 0.944, PRC AUC = 0.655) with limited interpretability, where the most important predictors of prolonged LOS are the level of blood urea nitrogen and of platelets. The Transformer model displays a good but lower performance (ROC AUC = 0.842, PRC AUC = 0.375) with a richer array of interpretability by providing more specific in-hospital factors including procedures, conditions, and medical history. The best model trained on mixed data satisfies both a high level of performance (ROC AUC = 0.963, PRC AUC = 0.746) and a much larger scope in interpretability including pathologies of the intestine, the colon, and the blood; infectious diseases, respiratory problems, procedures involving sedation and intubation, and vascular surgery.ConclusionsOur results outperform most of the state-of-the-art models in LOS prediction both in terms of performance and of interpretability. Data fusion between structured and unstructured text data may significantly improve performance and interpretability.

AB  - This work presents the results of convolutional neural networks trained in various procedures on data recordings from conscious, communicative patients recovering in post-surgery units. A prototype device measures non-invasively the bioimpedance by placing 3M patch electrodes in the hand palm of the patient. From the time signals acquired, a time-frequency algorithm is applied to extract the spectrogram 3D graphical model every second, during 4-6 hours. The aim was to detect whether artificial intelligence (AI) tools may offer a possible solution to obtain prediction of increasing pain levels in an objective way as to avoid the subjectivity of self-evaluation (currently golden standard in practice). The results obtained indicate a 73% accuracy with 86% successful detection of pain correlation to self-reported pain level. Specific training procedures have shown they are able to predict changes in pain levels which could be subsequently used in control algorithms, especially those prediction-based, which could greatly benefit from such complementary information. The discussion in this paper also puts the use of AI tools within the context of depth of anesthesia regulation, as AI tools greatly aid to minimize uncertainty in the loop dynamics.

TI  - Creation of a Pediatric Sedation Risk Assessment Scoring System: A Novel Method to Stratify Risk
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study aimed to create a pediatric sedation scoring system independent of the American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status (ASA-PS) classification that is predictive of adverse events, facilitates objective stratification, and resource allocation. Multivariable regression and machine learning algorithm analysis of 134,973 sedation encounters logged in to the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium (PSRC) database between July 2007 and June 2011. Patient and procedure variables were correlated with adverse events with resultant a-regression coefficients used to assign point values to each variable. Point values were then summed to create a risk assessment score. Validation of the model was performed with the 2011 to 2013 PSRC database followed by calculation of ROC curves and positive predictive values. Factors identified and resultant point values are as follows: 1 point: age <= 6 months, cardiac diagnosis, asthma, weight less than 5th percentile or greater than 95th, and computed tomography (CT) scan; 2 points: magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and weight greater than 99th percentile; 4 points: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 5 points: trisomy 21 and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD); 7 points: cough at the time of examination; and 18 points: bronchoscopy. Sum of patient and procedural values produced total risk assessment scores. Total risk assessment score of 5 had a sensitivity of 82.69% and a specificity of 26.22%, while risk assessment score of 11 had a sensitivity of 12.70% but a specificity of 95.29%. Inclusion of ASA-PS value did not improve model sensitivity or specificity and was thus excluded. Higher risk assessment scores predicted increased likelihood of adverse events during sedation. The score can be used to triage patients independent of ASA-PS with site-specific cut-off values used to determine appropriate sedation resource allocation.

T2  - ORAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveImpacted tooth is a common problem that can occur at any age, causing tooth decay, root resorption, and pain in the later stages. In recent years, major advances have been made in medical imaging segmentation using deep convolutional neural network-based networks. In this study, we report on the development of an artificial intelligence system for the automatic identification of impacted tooth from panoramic dental X-ray images.MethodsAmong existing networks, in medical imaging segmentation, U-Net architectures are widely implemented. In this article, for dental X-ray image segmentation, blocks and convolutional block structures using inverted residual blocks are upgraded by taking advantage of U-Net's network capacity-intensive connections. At the same time, we propose a method for jumping connections in which bi-directional convolution long short-term memory is used instead of a simple connection. Assessment of the proposed artificial intelligence model performance was evaluated with accuracy, F1-score, intersection over union, and recall.ResultsIn the proposed method, experimental results are obtained with 99.82% accuracy, 91.59% F1-score, 84.48% intersection over union, and 90.71% recall.ConclusionOur findings show that our artificial intelligence system could help with future diagnostic support in clinical practice.

TI  - Digital health in pain assessment, diagnosis, and management: Overview and perspectives
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PAIN RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Managing pain is essential for social, psychological, physical, and economic reasons. It is also a human right with a growing incidence of untreated and under-treated pain globally. Barriers to diagnosing, assessing, treating, and managing pain are complicated, subjective, and driven by patient, healthcare provider, payer, policy, and regulatory challenges. In addition, conventional treatment methods pose their own challenges including the subjectivity of assessment, lack of therapeutic innovation over the last decade, opioid use disorder and financial access to treatment. Digital health innovations hold much promise in providing complementary solutions to traditional medical interventions and may reduce cost and speed up recovery or adaptation. There is a growing evidence base for the use of digital health in pain assessment, diagnosis, and management. The challenge is not only to develop new technologies and solutions, but to do this within a framework that supports health equity, scalability, socio-cultural consideration, and evidence-based science. The extensive limits to physical personal interaction during the Covid-19 pandemic 2020/21 has proven the possible role of digital health in the field of pain medicine. This paper provides an overview of the use of digital health in pain management and argues for the use of a systemic framework in evaluating the efficacy of digital health solutions.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: We designed, prototyped, and tested a system that measures the viscoelastic response of tissue using nondestructive mechanical probing, with the goal of aiding clinical providers during epidural needle placement. This system is meant to alert clinicians when an epidural needle is about to strike bone during insertion. Methods: During needle insertion, the system periodically mechanically stimulates and collects viscoelastic response information data from the tissue at the needle's tip using an intra-needle probe. A machine-learning algorithm detects when the needle is close to bone using the series of observed stimulations. Results: Tests run on ex vivo pig spine show that the system can reliably determine if the needle is pointed at and within 3 mm of bone. Conclusion: Our technique can successfully differentiate materials at and in front of the needle's tip. However, it does not provide the 5 mm of forewarning that we believe would be necessary for use in clinical epidural needle placement. The technique may be of use in other applications requiring tissue differentiation during needle placement or in the intended application with further technical advances. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement: This Early/Pre-Clinical Research evaluates the feasibility of a method for helping clinical providers receive feedback during epidural needle insertion-thereby reducing complication rates-without significant alterations from current workflow.

AB  - Brain connectivity measurements can provide key information about ongoing brain processes. In this paper, we propose to investigate the performance of the binary classification of Propofol-induced sedation states using partial granger causality analysis. Based on the brain connectivity measurements obtained from EEG signals in a database that contains four sedation states: baseline, mild, moderate, and recovery, we consider eight sensors and evaluate the area under the ROC curve with five classifiers: the k-nearest neighbor (density method), support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, Bayesian discriminant analysis, and a model based on extreme learning machine. The results support the conclusion that the different Propofol-induced sedation states can be identified with an AUC of around 0.75, by considering signal segments of only 4 second. These results highlight the discriminant power that can be obtained from scalp level connectivity measures for online brain monitoring.

TI  - Repurposing ketamine to treat cocaine use disorder: integration of artificial intelligence-based prediction, expert evaluation, clinical corroboration and mechanism of action analyses
T2  - ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aimsCocaine use disorder (CUD) is a significant public health issue for which there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication. Drug repurposing looks for new cost-effective uses of approved drugs. This study presents an integrated strategy to identify repurposed FDA-approved drugs for CUD treatment. DesignOur drug repurposing strategy combines artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug prediction, expert panel review, clinical corroboration and mechanisms of action analysis being implemented in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Based on AI-based prediction and expert knowledge, ketamine was ranked as the top candidate for clinical corroboration via electronic health record (EHR) evaluation of CUD patient cohorts prescribed ketamine for anesthesia or depression compared with matched controls who received non-ketamine anesthesia or antidepressants/midazolam. Genetic and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to understand ketamine's potential mechanisms of action in the context of CUD. SettingThe study utilized TriNetX to access EHRs from more than 90 million patients world-wide. Genetic- and functional-level analyses used DisGeNet, Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases. ParticipantsA total of 7742 CUD patients who received anesthesia (3871 ketamine-exposed and 3871 anesthetic-controlled) and 7910 CUD patients with depression (3955 ketamine-exposed and 3955 antidepressant-controlled) were identified after propensity score-matching. MeasurementsEHR analysis outcome was a CUD remission diagnosis within 1 year of drug prescription. FindingsPatients with CUD prescribed ketamine for anesthesia displayed a significantly higher rate of CUD remission compared with matched individuals prescribed other anesthetics [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.42-2.78]. Similarly, CUD patients prescribed ketamine for depression evidenced a significantly higher CUD remission ratio compared with matched patients prescribed antidepressants or midazolam (HR = 4.39, 95% CI = 2.89-6.68). The mechanism of action analysis revealed that ketamine directly targets multiple CUD-associated genes (BDNF, CNR1, DRD2, GABRA2, GABRB3, GAD1, OPRK1, OPRM1, SLC6A3, SLC6A4) and pathways implicated in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cAMP signaling and cocaine abuse/dependence. ConclusionsKetamine appears to be a potential repurposed drug for treatment of cocaine use disorder.

M3  - Article
AB  - Anesthesia information management systems (AIMS) have evolved from simple, automated intraoperative record keepers in a select few institutions to widely adopted, sophisticated hardware and software solutions that are integrated into a hospital's electronic health record system and used to manage and document a patient's entire perioperative experience. AIMS implementations have resulted in numerous billing, research, and clinical benefits, yet there remain challenges and areas of potential improvement to AIMS utilization. This article provides an overview of the history of AIMS, the components and features of AIMS, and the benefits and challenges associated with implementing and using AIMS. As AIMS continue to proliferate and data are increasingly shared across multi-institutional collaborations, visual analytics and advanced analytics techniques such as machine learning may be applied to AIMS data to reap even more benefits.

TI  - Video-Based versus On-Site Neonatal Pain Assessment in Neonatal Intensive Care Units: The Impact of Video-Based Neonatal Pain Assessment in Real-World Scenario on Pain Diagnosis and Its Artificial Intelligence Application
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neonatal pain assessment (NPA) represents a huge global problem of essential importance, as a timely and accurate assessment of neonatal pain is indispensable for implementing pain management. Purpose: To investigate the consistency of pain scores derived through video-based NPA (VB-NPA) and on-site NPA (OS-NPA), providing the scientific foundation and feasibility of adopting VB-NPA results in a real-world scenario as the gold standard for neonatal pain in clinical studies and labels for artificial intelligence (AI)-based NPA (AI-NPA) applications. Setting: A total of 598 neonates were recruited from a pediatric hospital in China. Methods: This observational study recorded 598 neonates who underwent one of 10 painful procedures, including arterial blood sampling, heel blood sampling, fingertip blood sampling, intravenous injection, subcutaneous injection, peripheral intravenous cannulation, nasopharyngeal suctioning, retention enema, adhesive removal, and wound dressing. Two experienced nurses performed OS-NPA and VB-NPA at a 10-day interval through double-blind scoring using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale to evaluate the pain level of the neonates. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were calculated and analyzed, and a paired samples t-test was used to explore the bias and consistency of the assessors' pain scores derived through OS-NPA and VB-NPA. The impact of different label sources was evaluated using three state-of-the-art AI methods trained with labels given by OS-NPA and VB-NPA, respectively. Results: The intra-rater reliability of the same assessor was 0.976-0.983 across different times, as measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient. The inter-rater reliability was 0.983 for single measures and 0.992 for average measures. No significant differences were observed between the OS-NPA scores and the assessment of an independent VB-NPA assessor. The different label sources only caused a limited accuracy loss of 0.022-0.044 for the three AI methods. Conclusion: VB-NPA in a real-world scenario is an effective way to assess neonatal pain due to its high intra-rater and inter-rater reliability compared to OS-NPA and could be used for the labeling of large-scale NPA video databases for clinical studies and AI training.

TI  - The role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in clinical anaesthesia practice
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review Growing concerns about the environmental effects of volatile anaesthetics are likely to lead to increased use of intravenous anaesthetic drugs. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models can increase the accuracy of intravenous drug titration, especially in populations that differ from the 'average.' However, with a growing number of PKPD models, and other technology available to date, it can be hard to see the wood for the trees. This review attempts to guide the reader through the PKPD jungle. Recent findings General purpose PKPD models for propofol and remifentanil designed to apply to a broader population, including children, the elderly and the obese, reduce the need for population-specific models. PKPD models for drugs such as dexmedetomidine and antimicrobial agents may be useful for procedural sedation or in the ICU. Technological advances such as Bayesian model adjustment based on point-of-care plasma concentration measurements, closed-loop drug delivery and artificial intelligence may improve the ease of use of the anaesthetic drugs and increase the accuracy of titration. Newer and more complex modelling techniques and technological advancements can help to deliver anaesthetic drugs, sedatives and other drugs in a more stable and thereby safer way.

TI  - Improving liver transplant outcomes with transplant-omics and network biology
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewMolecular omics data is increasingly ubiquitous throughout medicine. In organ transplantation, recent large-scale research efforts are generating the 'transplant-ome' - the entire set of molecular omics data, including the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. Importantly, early studies in anesthesiology have demonstrated how perioperative interventions alter molecular profiles in various patient populations. The next step for anesthesiologists and intensivists will be to tailor perioperative care to the transplant-ome of individual liver transplant patients.Recent findingsIn liver transplant patients, elements of the transplant-ome predict complications and point to novel interventions. Importantly, molecular profiles of both the donor organ and recipient contribute to this risk, and interventions like normothermic machine perfusion influence these profiles. As we can now measure various omics molecules simultaneously, we can begin to understand how these molecules interact to form molecular networks and emerging technologies offer noninvasive and continuous ways to measure these networks throughout the perioperative period. Molecules that regulate these networks are likely mediators of complications and actionable clinical targets throughout the perioperative period.SummaryThe transplant-ome can be used to tailor perioperative care to the individual liver transplant patient. Monitoring molecular networks continuously and noninvasively would provide new opportunities to optimize perioperative management.

TI  - Comparative analysis of popular predictors for difficult laryngoscopy using hybrid intelligent detection methods
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Difficult laryngoscopy is associated with airway injury, and asphyxia. There are no guidelines or gold standards for detecting difficult laryngoscopy. There are many opinions on which predictors to use to detect difficult laryngoscopy exposure, and no comprehensively unified comparative analysis has been conducted. The efficacy and accuracy of deep learning (DL)-based models and machine learning (ML)-based models for predicting difficult laryngoscopy need to be evaluated and compared, under the circumstance that the flourishing of deep neural networks (DNN) has increasingly left ML less concentrated and uncreative. For the first time, the performance of difficult laryngoscopy prediction for a dataset of 671 patients, under single index and integrated multiple in-dicators was consistently verified under seven ML-based models and four DL-based approaches. The top dog was a simple traditional machine learning model, Naive Bayes, outperforming DL-based models, the best test accuracy is 86.6%, the F1 score is 0.908, and the average precision score is 0.837. Three radiological variables of difficult laryngoscopy were all valuable separately and combinedly and the ranking was presented. There is no significant difference in performance among the three radiological indicators individually (83.06% vs. 83.20% vs. 83.33%) and comprehensively (83.74%), suggesting that anesthesiologists can flexibly choose appropriate measurement indicators according to the actual situation to predict difficult laryngoscopy. Adaptive spatial interaction was imposed to the model to boost the performance of difficult laryngoscopy prediction with preoperative cervical spine X-ray.

TI  - Calculations of consciousness: electroencephalography analyses to determine anesthetic depth
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewElectroencephalography (EEG) was introduced into anesthesia practice in the 1990s as a tool to titrate anesthetic depth. However, limitations in current analysis techniques have called into question whether these techniques improve standard of care, or instead call for improved, more ubiquitously applicable measures to assess anesthetic transitions and depth. This review highlights emerging analytical approaches and techniques from neuroscience research that have the potential to better capture anesthetic transitions to provide better measurements of anesthetic depth.Recent findingsSince the introduction of electroencephalography, neuroscientists, engineers, mathematicians, and clinicians have all been developing new ways of analyzing continuous electrical signals. Collaborations between these fields have proliferated several analytical techniques that demonstrate how anesthetics affect brain dynamics and conscious transitions. Here, we review techniques in the following categories: network science, integration and information, nonlinear dynamics, and artificial intelligence.SummaryUp-and-coming techniques have the potential to better clinically define and characterize altered consciousness time points. Such new techniques used alongside traditional measures have the potential to improve depth of anesthesia measurements and enhance an understanding of how the brain is affected by anesthetic agents. However, new measures will be needed to be tested for robustness in real-world environments and on diverse experimental protocols.

TI  - Peri-operative care pathways: re-engineering care to achieve the 'triple aim'
T2  - ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Elective surgical pathways offer a particular opportunity to plan radical change in the way care is delivered, based on patient need rather than provider convenience. Peri-operative pathway redesign enables improved patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction), population/public health, and healthcare value (outcome per unit of currency). Among physicians with the skills to work within peri-operative medicine, anaesthetists are well positioned to lead the re-engineering of such pathways. Re-engineered pre-operative pathways open up opportunities for intervention before surgery including shared decision-making, comorbidity management and collaborative behavioural change. Individualised, risk-adapted, intra-operative interventions will drive more reliable and consistent care. Risk-adapted postoperative care, particularly around transitions of care, has a significant role in improving value through peri-operative medicine. Improved integration with primary care providers offers the potential for minimising errors around transitions of care before and after surgery, as well as maximising opportunities for population health interventions, including lifestyle modification (e.g. activity/exercise, smoking and/or alcohol cessation), pain management and sleep medicine. Systematic data collection focused on quality improvement is essential to drive continuous clinical improvement and will be enabled by technological development in predictive analytics, systems modelling and artificial intelligence.

TI  - Medical instrument detection in ultrasound: a review
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Medical instrument detection is essential for computer-assisted interventions, since it facilitates clinicians to find instruments efficiently with a better interpretation, thereby improving clinical outcomes. This article reviews image-based medical instrument detection methods for ultrasound-guided (US-guided) operations. Literature is selected based on an exhaustive search in different sources, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus. We first discuss the key clinical applications of medical instrument detection in the US, including delivering regional anesthesia, biopsy taking, prostate brachytherapy, and catheterization. Then, we present a comprehensive review of instrument detection methodologies, including non-machine-learning and machine-learning methods. The conventional non-machine-learning methods were extensively studied before the era of machine learning methods. The principal issues and potential research directions for future studies are summarized for the computer-assisted intervention community. In conclusion, although promising results have been obtained by the current (non-) machine learning methods for different clinical applications, thorough clinical validations are still required.

TI  - Artificial intelligence-powered ultrasound guided regional nerve block in three patients: Case report
T2  - AGRI-THE JOURNAL OF THE TURKISH SOCIETY OF ALGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of ultrasound in regional anesthesia plays an important role in determining the variable anatomical structures and their localization. In these days, developments in ultrasonography devices and probes, hardware, and software technologies such as real-time needle tip tracking are increasing rapidly. Artificial intelligence-powered ultrasonography is one of them. In this case report, we aimed to present three cases where regional block was applied using artificial intelligence-powered (Nerveblox) ultrasound. Infraclavicular nerve block to two of our patients and pectoral nerve block to the third one were applied successfully once at a time. None of the patients developed vascular puncture or local anesthetic toxicity. The use of artificial intelligence support in peripheral nerve blocks may reduce the number of attempts and duration of interventions.

TI  - Adaptive Sedation Monitoring From EEG in ICU Patients With Online Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sedative medications are routinely administered to provide comfort and facilitate clinical care in critically ill ICU patients. Prior work shows that brain monitoring using electroencephalography (EEG) to track sedation levels may help medical personnel to optimize drug dosing and avoid the adverse effects of oversedation and undersedation. However, the performance of sedation monitoring methods proposed to date deal poorly with individual variability across patients, leading to inconsistent performance. To address this challenge we develop an online learning approach based on Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors (AROW). Our approach adaptively updates a sedation level prediction algorithm under a continuously evolving data distribution. The prediction model is gradually calibrated for individual patients in response to EEG observations and routine clinical assessments over time. The evaluations are performed on a population of 172 sedated ICU patients whose sedation levels were assessed using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (scores between -5 = comatose and 0 = awake). The proposed adaptive model achieves better performance than the same model without adaptation (average accuracies with tolerance of one level difference: 68.76% vs. 61.10%). Moreover, our approach is shown to be robust to sudden changes caused by label noise. Medication administrations have different effects on model performance. We find that the model performs best in patients receiving only propofol, compared to patients receiving no sedation or multiple simultaneous sedative medications.

TI  - Pain Management Experiences and the Acceptability of Cognitive Behavioral Strategies Among American Indians and Alaska Natives
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSCULTURAL NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this project was to explore the chronic pain experience and establish cultural appropriateness of cognitive behavioral pain management (CBPM) techniques in American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). Design: A semistructured interview guide was used with three focus groups of AI/AN patients in the U.S. Southwest and Pacific Northwest regions to explore pain and CBPM in AI/ANs. Findings: The participants provided rich qualitative data regarding chronic pain and willingness to use CBPM. Themes included empty promises and health care insufficiencies, individuality, pain management strategies, and suggestions for health care providers. Conclusion: Results suggest that there is room for improvement in chronic pain care among AI/ANs and that CBPM would likely be a viable and culturally appropriate approach for chronic pain management. Implications: This research provides evidence that CBPM is culturally acceptable and in alignment with existing traditional AI/AN strategies for coping and healing.

TI  - Pain Intensity Assessment in Sickle Cell Disease Patients Using Vital Signs During Hospital Visits.
T2  - Pattern Recognition : ICPR International Workshops and Challenges, virtual event, January 10-15, 2021, proceedings. Part I. International Conference on Pattern Recognition (25th : 2021 : Online)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) is often associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and high healthcare costs. The standard method for predicting the absence, presence, and intensity of pain has long been self-report. However, medical providers struggle to manage patients based on subjective pain reports correctly and pain medications often lead to further difficulties in patient communication as they may cause sedation and sleepiness. Recent studies have shown that objective physiological measures can predict subjective self-reported pain scores for inpatient visits using machine learning (ML) techniques. In this study, we evaluate the generalizability of ML techniques to data collected from 50 patients over an extended period across three types of hospital visits (i.e., inpatient, outpatient and outpatient evaluation). We compare five classification algorithms for various pain intensity levels at both intra-individual (within each patient) and inter-individual (between patients) level. While all the tested classifiers perform much better than chance, a Decision Tree (DT) model performs best at predicting pain on an 11-point severity scale (from 0-10) with an accuracy of 0.728 at an inter-individual level and 0.653 at an intra-individual level. The accuracy of DT significantly improves to 0.941 on a 2-point rating scale (i.e., no/mild pain: 0-5, severe pain: 6-10) at an inter-individual level. Our experimental results demonstrate that ML techniques can provide an objective and quantitative evaluation of pain intensity levels for all three types of hospital visits.

M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Could an overly deep sedation be anticipated from ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) patterns? We report here motifs hidden in the EEG signal that predict the appearance of Iso-Electric Suppressions (IES), observed during epileptic encephalopathies, drug intoxications, comatose, brain death or during anesthetic over-dosage that are considered to be detrimental. To show that IES occurrences can be predicted from EEG traces dynamics, we focus on transient suppression of the alpha rhythm (8-14Hz) recorded for 80 patients, that had a Propofol target controlled infusion of 5mug/ml during a general anesthesia. We found that the first time of appearance as well as changes in duration of these Alpha-Suppressions (alphaS) are two parameters that anticipate the appearance of IES. Using machine learning, we predicted IES appearance from the first 10min of EEG (AUC of 0.93). To conclude, transient motifs in the alpha rhythm predict IES during anesthesia and can be used to identify patients, with higher risks of post-operative complications.

AB  - IntroductionAmongst the 25.7 million survivors and 6.5 million deaths from stroke between 1990 and 2013, ischemic strokes accounted for approximately 70% and 50% of the cases, respectively. With patients still suffering from complications and stroke recurrence, more questions have been raised as to how we can better improve patient management.Areas coveredThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) were adopted to ensure a comprehensive inclusion of quality literature from various sources. PubMed and Embase were searched for evidence on thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, artificial intelligence (AI), antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation and hypertension management.Expert opinionThe directions of future research in these areas are dependent on the current level of validation. Endovascular therapy and applications of AI are relatively new compared to the other areas discussed in this review. As such, future studies need to focus on validating their efficacy. As for thrombolysis, antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy, their efficacy has been well-established and future research efforts should be directed toward adjusting its use according to patient-specific factors, starting with factors with the most clinical relevance and prevalence.

TI  - Identifying modifiable and nonmodifiable cost drivers of ambulatory rotator cuff repair: a machine learning analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Implementing novel tools that identify contributors to the cost of orthopedic procedures can help hospitals maximize efficiency, minimize waste, improve surgical decision-making, and practice value-based care. The purpose of this study was to develop and internally validate a machine learning algorithm to identify key drivers of total charges after ambulatory arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and compare its performance with a state-of-the-art statistical learning model.Methods: A retrospective review of the New York State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database was performed to identify patients who underwent elective outpatient rotator cuff repair (RCR) from 2015 to 2016. Initial models were constructed using patient characteristics (age, gender, insurance status, patient income, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index) as well as intraoperative variables (concomitant procedures and ser-vices, operative time). These were subsequently entered into 5 separate machine learning algorithms and a generalized additive model using natural splines. Global variable importance and partial dependence curves were constructed to identify the greatest contributors to cost.Results: A total of 33,976 patients undergoing ambulatory RCR were included. Median total charges after ambulatory RCR were $16,017 (interquartile range: $11,009-$22,510). The ensemble model outperformed the generalized additive model and demonstrated the best per-formance on internal validation (root mean squared error: $7112, 95% confidence interval: 7036-7188; logarithmic root mean squared error: 0.354, 95% confidence interval: 0.336-0.373, R2: 0.53), and identified major drivers of total charges after RCR as increasing oper-ating room time, patient income level, number of anchors used, use of local infiltration anesthesia/peripheral nerve blocks, non-White race/ ethnicity, and concurrent distal clavicle excision. The model was integrated into a web-based open-access application capable of providing individual predictions and explanations on a case-by-case basis.Conclusion: This study developed an ensemble supervised machine learning algorithm that outperformed a sophisticated statistical learning model in predicting total charges after ambulatory RCR. Important contributors to total charges included operating room time, duration of care, number of anchors used, type of anesthesia, concomitant distal clavicle excision, community characteristics, and patient demographic factors. Generation of a patient-specific payment schedule based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality risk of mortality highlighted the financial risk assumed by physicians in flat episodic reimbursement schedules given variable patient comorbidities and the importance of an accurate prediction algorithm to appropriately reward high-value care at low costs.Level of evidence: Level IV; Economic Analysis (c) 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

TI  - Design and Implementation of a Machine Learning Based EEG Processor for Accurate Estimation of Depth of Anesthesia
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is essential for intraoperative and postoperative patient's health. Commercially available electroencephalograph (EEG)-based DoA monitors are recommended only for certain anesthetic drugs and specific age-group patients. This paper presents a machine learning classification processor for accurate DoA estimation irrespective of the patient's age and anesthetic drug. The classification is solely based on six features extracted from EEG signal, i.e., spectral edge frequency (SEF), beta ratio, and four bands of spectral energy (FBSE). A machine learning fine decision tree classifier is adopted to achieve a four-class DoA classification (deep, moderate, and light DoA versus awake state). The feature selection and the classification processor are optimized to achieve the highest classification accuracy for the state of moderate anesthesia required for the surgical operations. The proposed 256-point fast Fourier transform accelerator is implemented to realize SEF, beta ratio, and FBSE that enables minimal latency and high accuracy feature extraction. The proposed DoA processor is implemented using a 65 nm CMOS technology and experimentally verified using field programming gate array (FPGA) based on the EEG recordings of 75 patients undergoing elective surgery with different types of anesthetic agents. The processor achieves an average accuracy of 92.2% for all DoA states, with a latency of 1s The 0.09 mm(2) DoA processor consumes 140nJ/classification.

TI  - Machine Learning Prediction Models to Reduce Length of Stay at Ambulatory Surgery Centers Through Case Resequencing
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay is an important perioperative efficiency metric. The aim of this study was to develop machine learning models to predict ambulatory surgery patients at risk for prolonged PACU length of stay - using only pre-operatively identified factors - and then to simulate the effectiveness in reducing the need for after-hours PACU staffing. Several machine learning classifier models were built to predict prolonged PACU length of stay (defined as PACU stay & GE; 3 hours) on a training set. A case resequencing exercise was then performed on the test set, in which historic cases were re-sequenced based on the predicted risk for prolonged PACU length of stay. The frequency of patients remaining in the PACU after-hours (& GE; 7:00 pm) were compared between the simulated operating days versus actual operating room days. There were 10,928 ambulatory surgical patients included in the analysis, of which 580 (5.31%) had a PACU length of stay & GE; 3 hours. XGBoost with SMOTE performed the best (AUC = 0.712). The case resequencing exercise utilizing the XGBoost model resulted in an over three-fold improvement in the number of days in which patients would be in the PACU past 7pm as compared with historic performance (41% versus 12%, P<0.0001). Predictive models using preoperative patient characteristics may allow for optimized case sequencing, which may mitigate the effects of prolonged PACU lengths of stay on after-hours staffing utilization.

TI  - Upper Respiratory Infections and Airway Adverse Events in Pediatric Procedural Sedation
T2  - PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Upper respiratory infections (URIs) are associated with airway adverse events (AAEs) during general anesthesia. There have been no large studies examining the relationship between URIs and AAEs during pediatric procedural sedation. We hypothesized that there would be a relationship between URI status and AAEs in pediatric procedural sedation.METHODS: We examined prospectively collected data from the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium database. Specific questions regarding URI status were added to the database to facilitate our analysis. Characteristics of patients, procedure types, adjunctive medications, adverse events, and airway interventions (Als) were reported. We performed bivariate analysis of adverse events and URI status, then used a multivariable logistic regression model to assess the relationship between URI status and adverse events. We examined the secondary outcome of Al similarly.RESULTS: Of the 105 728 sedations entered into the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium database during the study period, we were able to use 83 491 for analysis. Controlling for multiple patient, drug, and procedure characteristics, recent and current URI were associated with increased frequency of AAEs. In general, the frequency of AAEs and Als increased from recent URI, to current URI-clear secretions to current URI-thick secretions. We did not find a relationship between URI status and non-AAEs.CONCLUSIONS: URI status is associated with a statistically significant increase in frequency of AA Es and Al during pediatric procedural sedation for the population sedated by our consortium. Although URI status merits consideration in determining potential risk for sedation, rates of some AAEs and Als remained low regardless of URI status.

Some of these outcomes may be prevented through early identification of at-risk patients and through intraoperative risk mitigation. Telemedicine has revolutionized the way at-risk patients are identified in critical care, but intraoperative telemedicine services are not widely used in anesthesiology. Clinicians in telemedicine settings may assist with risk stratification and brainstorm risk mitigation strategies while clinicians in the operating room are busy performing other patient care tasks. Machine learning tools may help clinicians in telemedicine settings leverage the abundant electronic health data available in the perioperative period. The primary hypothesis for this study is that anesthesiology clinicians can predict postoperative complications more accurately with machine learning assistance than without machine learning assistance. Methods: This investigation is a sub-study nested within the TECTONICS randomized clinical trial (NCT03923699). As part of TECTONICS, study team members who are anesthesiology clinicians working in a telemedicine setting are currently reviewing ongoing surgical cases and documenting how likely they feel the patient is to experience 30-day in-hospital death or acute kidney injury. For patients who are included in this sub-study, these case reviews will be randomized to be performed with access to a display showing machine learning predictions for the postoperative complications or without access to the display. The accuracy of the predictions will be compared across these two groups. Conclusion: Successful completion of this study will help define the role of machine learning not only for intraoperative telemedicine, but for other risk assessment tasks before, during, and after surgery. Registration: ORACLE is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05042804; registered September 13, 2021.

TI  - Patient Safety of Perioperative Medication Through the Lens of Digital Health and Artificial Intelligence.
T2  - JMIR perioperative medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Perioperative medication has made significant contributions to enhancing patient safety. Nevertheless, administering medication during this period still poses considerable safety concerns, with many errors being detected only after causing significant physiological disturbances. The intricacy of medication administration in the perioperative setting poses specific challenges to patient safety. To address these challenges, implementing potential strategies and interventions is critical. One such strategy is raising awareness and revising educational curricula regarding drug safety in the operating room. Another crucial strategy is recognizing the importance of redundancy and multiple checks in the operating room as a hallmark of medication safety, which is not a common practice. Digital health technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) also offer the potential to improve perioperative medication safety. Computerized physician order entry systems, electronic medication administration records, and barcode medication administration systems have been proven to reduce medication errors and improve patient safety. By implementing these strategies and interventions, health care professionals can enhance the safety of perioperative medication administration and improve patient outcomes.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review The goal of this review is to describe the recent improvements in clinical decision tools applied to the increasingly large and complex datasets in the pediatric ambulatory and inpatient setting. Recent findings Clinical decision support has evolved beyond simple static alerts to complex dynamic alerts for: diagnosis, medical decision-making, monitoring of physiological, laboratory, and pharmacologic inputs, and adherence to institutional and national guidelines for both the patient and the healthcare team. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have enabled advances in predicting outcomes, such as sepsis and early deterioration, and assisting in procedural technique. With more than a decade of electronic medical data generation, clinical decision support tools have begun to evolve into more sophisticated and complex algorithms capable of transforming large datasets into succinct, timely, and pertinent summaries for treatment and management of pediatric patients. Future developments will need to leverage patient-generated health data, integrated device data, and provider-entered data to complete the continuum of patient care and will likely demonstrate improvements in patient outcomes.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Pain from Facial Expressions: A Survey
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pain sensation is essential for survival, since it draws attention to physical threat to the body. Pain assessment is usually done through self-reports. However, self-assessment of pain is not available in the case of noncommunicative patients, and therefore, observer reports should be relied upon. Observer reports of pain could be prone to errors due to subjective biases of observers. Moreover, continuous monitoring by humans is impractical. Therefore, automatic pain detection technology could be deployed to assist human caregivers and complement their service, thereby improving the quality of pain management, especially for noncommunicative patients. Facial expressions are a reliable indicator of pain, and are used in all observer-based pain assessment tools. Following the advancements in automatic facial expression analysis, computer vision researchers have tried to use this technology for developing approaches for automatically detecting pain from facial expressions. This paper surveys the literature published in this field over the past decade, categorizes it, and identifies future research directions. The survey covers the pain datasets used in the reviewed literature, the learning tasks targeted by the approaches, the features extracted from images and image sequences to represent pain-related information, and finally, the machine learning methods used.

AB  - Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia (UGRA) is growing rapidly in the medical field, and becomes a standard procedure in many worldwide hospitals. UGRA can specifically benefit from image processing and machine learning techniques. Very few studies have been developed for that purpose. This paper focuses on automatic localization of nerve in ultrasound images, in order to assist anaesthetists during UGRA procedure. Due to the complex structure of nerve and poor quality of ultrasound images, the automatic detection of nerve region is a challenging problem. To handle such issue, several processing phases are required. For that purpose, we propose a new method, based on despeckling, feature ranking and majority vote classification, for a robust and accurate median nerve localization. The proposed method is applied on a real dataset obtained from eight patients. The obtained results showed high performance for median nerve detection achieving accuracy of 89% of the f-score measure.

TI  - Evidence Review Conducted for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery: Focus on Anesthesiology for Total Knee Arthroplasty
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has rapidly gained popularity in a variety of surgical subspecialities. A large body of literature suggests that ERAS leads to superior outcomes, improved patient satisfaction, reduced length of hospital stay, and cost benefits, without affecting rates of readmission after surgery. These patterns have been described for patients undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA); however, adoption of ERAS to orthopedic surgery has lagged behind other surgical disciplines. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, in partnership with the American College of Surgeons and the Johns Hopkins Medicine Armstrong Institute (AI) for Patient Safety and Quality, has developed the Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery. The program comprises a national effort to incorporate best practice in perioperative care and improve patient safety, for over 750 hospitals and multiple procedures over the next 5 years, including orthopedic surgery. We have conducted a full evidence review of anesthetic interventions to derive anesthesiology-related components of an evidence-based ERAS pathway for TKA. A PubMed search was performed for each protocol component, focusing on the highest levels of evidence in the literature. Search findings are summarized in narrative format. Anesthesiology components of care were identified and evaluated across the pre-, intra-, and postoperative phases. A summary of the best available evidence, together with recommendations for inclusion in ERAS protocols for TKA, is provided. There is extensive evidence in the literature, and from society guidelines to support the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery goals for TKA.

TI  - "The show must go on": Aftermath of Covid-19 on anesthesiology residency programs
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - COVID-19 has caused tectonic changes in the personal and professional lives of anesthesiologists and, among several aspects, anesthesiology residency and sub-specialty training has also undergone an unforeseen overhaul. We read the articles published on the impact of COVID-19 on training of anesthesiologists and set out to extract and narrate all the significant observations. At the outset, we begin by explaining how this pandemic posed a threat to the safety of the residents and mitigating measures like PPE and barriers that have now become 'the new normal'. Sub-specialties like critical care, cardiac anesthesia, pain and palliative care have also faced difficulty in imparting training due to an initial dearth in elective surgery case load but have adapted innovative measures to overcome that. Initially, conducting thesis and research became difficult due to problems in achieving the desires sample size needed to get significant results, but this pandemic has emerged as a dynamic laboratory where topics like 'psychological impact of COVID-19' and 'development of artificial intelligence models in COVID-19 ICUs' came into the fore. Pattern of examination has also become virtual and webinars showed how knowledge, with the right medium, has the potential of global outreach. As the pandemic took a toll on the mental health of the residents, attention was paid to this previously neglected aspect and ensuring their emotional well-being became a priority to avoid the issue of burn-out. We comment on how what initially was considered a scary problem, actually paved way for growth. It brought attention to safety, innovation, new tools for training, finding solutions within constraints, continuing developing our residents into future leaders who were also trained for mitigating disasters. Changes like online education, research on socio-economic impact, priority to mental health and artificial intelligence are here to stay and by imbibing it, we ensure that 'the show must go on'.

TI  - A Novel Method for Colorectal Cancer Screening Based on Circulating Tumor Cells and Machine Learning
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and it can have a high mortality rate if left untreated or undiagnosed. The fact that CRC becomes symptomatic at advanced stages highlights the importance of early screening. The reference screening method for CRC is colonoscopy, an invasive, time-consuming procedure that requires sedation or anesthesia and is recommended from a certain age and above. The aim of this study was to build a machine learning classifier that can distinguish cancer from non-cancer samples. For this, circulating tumor cells were enumerated using flow cytometry. Their numbers were used as a training set for building an optimized SVM classifier that was subsequently used on a blind set. The SVM classifier's accuracy on the blind samples was found to be 90.0%, sensitivity was 80.0%, specificity was 100.0%, precision was 100.0% and AUC was 0.98. Finally, in order to test the generalizability of our method, we also compared the performances of different classifiers developed by various machine learning models, using over-sampling datasets generated by the SMOTE algorithm. The results showed that SVM achieved the best performances according to the validation accuracy metric. Overall, our results demonstrate that CTCs enumerated by flow cytometry can provide significant information, which can be used in machine learning algorithms to successfully discriminate between healthy and colorectal cancer patients. The clinical significance of this method could be the development of a simple, fast, non-invasive cancer screening tool based on blood CTC enumeration by flow cytometry and machine learning algorithms.

TI  - Neural Correlates of Anesthesia in Newborn Mice and Humans
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the hypnotic component of anesthesia during surgeries is critical to prevent intraoperative awareness and reduce adverse side effects. For this purpose, electroencephalographic (EEG) methods complementing measures of autonomic functions and behavioral responses are in use in clinical practice. However, in human neonates and infants existing methods may be unreliable and the correlation between brain activity and anesthetic depth is still poorly understood. Here, we characterized the effects of different anesthetics on brain activity in neonatal mice and developed machine learning approaches to identify electrophysiological features predicting inspired or end-tidal anesthetic concentration as a proxy for anesthetic depth. We show that similar features from EEG recordings can be applied to predict anesthetic concentration in neonatal mice and humans. These results might support a novel strategy to monitor anesthetic depth in human newborns.

TI  - Health Services Research in Anesthesia: A Brief Overview of Common Methodologies
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of large data sources such as registries and claims-based data sets to perform health services research in anesthesia has increased considerably, ultimately informing clinical decisions, supporting evaluation of policy or intervention changes, and guiding further research. These observational data sources come with limitations that must be addressed to effectively examine all aspects of health care services and generate new individual- and population-level knowledge. Several statistical methods are growing in popularity to address these limitations, with the goal of mitigating confounding and other biases. In this article, we provide a brief overview of common statistical methods used in health services research when using observational data sources, guidance on their interpretation, and examples of how they have been applied to anesthesia-related health services research. Methods described involve regression, propensity scoring, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, interrupted time series, and machine learning.

AB  - Anesthetics are commonly employed during surgical processes to dull out sensations. Despite their widespread adoption and effectiveness, there continue to be shortcomings associated with their use that span cognitive and neurological side effects. An avenue towards minimizing these side effects involves better means of monitoring the depth of anesthesia (DoA) administered during the sedation process. As part of strides towards investigating this problem, this work involved using EEG brain waves acquired from the frontal cortex region during surgery to predict DoA. Specifically, we employed a signal decomposition pre-processing technique, followed by a feature selection process to obtain an optimal feature set used for modelling linear and nonlinear regression-based algorithms for prediction tasks. The obtained results showed a range of prediction accuracies across the various patients, and the proposed approach produced the highest classification accuracy when predicting the awake state-a feat which is also echoed across the literature.

TI  - Identification of difficult to intubate patients from frontal face images using an ensemble of deep learning models
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Failure to identify difficult intubation is the leading cause of anesthesia-related death and morbidity. Despite preoperative airway assessment, 75-93% of difficult intubations are unanticipated, and airway examination methods underperform, with sensitivities of 20-62% and specificities of 82-97%. To overcome these impediments, we aim to develop a deep learning model to identify difficult to intubate patients using frontal face images. We proposed an ensemble of convolutional neural networks which leverages a database of celebrity facial images to learn robust features of multiple face regions. This ensemble extracts features from patient images (n = 152) which are subsequently classified by a respective ensemble of attention-based multiple instance learning models. Through majority voting, a patient is classified as difficult or easy to intubate. Whereas two conventional bedside tests resulted in AUCs of 0.6042 and 0.4661, the proposed method resulted in an AUC of 0.7105 using a cohort of 76 difficult and 76 easy to intubate patients. Generic features yielded AUCs of 0.4654-0.6278. The proposed model can operate at high sensitivity and low specificity (0.9079 and 0.4474) or low sensitivity and high specificity (0.3684 and 0.9605). The proposed ensembled model outperforms conventional bedside tests and generic features. Side facial images may improve the performance of the proposed model. The proposed method significantly surpasses conventional bedside tests and deep learning methods. We expect our model will play an important role in developing deep learning methods where frontal face features play an important role.

AB  - Background and Aims: EGD is the most vital procedure for the diagnosis of upper GI lesions. We aimed to compare the performance of unsedated ultrathin transoral endoscopy (U-TOE), unsedated conventional EGD (C-EGD), and sedated C-EGD with or without the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) system.Methods: In this prospective, single-blind, 3-parallel-group, randomized, single-center trial, 437 patients scheduled to undergo outpatient EGD were randomized to unsedated U-TOE, unsedated C-EGD, or sedated C-EGD, and each group was then divided into 2 subgroups: with or without the assistance of an AI system to monitor blind spots during EGD. The primary outcome was the blind spot rate of these 3 groups with the assistance of AI. The secondary outcomes were to compare blind spot rates of unsedated U-TOE, unsedated, and sedated C-EGD with or without the assistance of AI, respectively, and the concordance between AI and the endoscopists' review.Results: The blind spot rate with AI-assisted sedated C-EGD was significantly lower than that of unsedated U-TOE and unsedated C-EGD (3.42% vs 21.77% vs 31.23%, respectively; P < .05). The blind spot rate of the AI subgroup was lower than that of the control subgroup in all 3 groups (sedated C-EGD: 3.42% vs 22.46%, P < .001; unsedated U-TOE: 21.77% vs 29.92%, P < .001; unsedated C-EGD: 31.23% vs 42.46%, P < .001).Conclusions: The blind spot rate of sedated C-EGD was the lowest among the 3 types of EGD, and the addition of AI had a maximal effect on sedated C-EGD.

TI  - Quantification of hepatic steatosis in histologic images by deep learning method
T2  - JOURNAL OF X-RAY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and test a novel method for automatic quantification of hepatic steatosis in histologic images based on the deep learning scheme designed to predict the fat ratio directly, which aims to improve accuracy in diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with objective assessment of the severity of hepatic steatosis instead of subjective visual estimation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six 8-week old New Zealand white rabbits of both sexes were fed with highcholesterol, high-fat diet and sacrificed under deep anesthesia at various time points to obtain the pathological specimen. All rabbits were performed by multislice computed tomography for surveillance to measure density changes of liver parenchyma. A deep learning scheme using a convolutional neural network was developed to directly predict the liver fat ratio based on the pathological images. The average error value, standard deviation, and accuracy (error <5%) were evaluated and compared between the deep learning scheme and manual segmentation results. The Pearson's correlation coefficient was also calculated in this study.RESULTS: The deep learning scheme performs successfully on rabbit liver histologic data, showing a high degree of accuracy and stability. The average error value, standard deviation, and accuracy (error <5%) were 3.21%, 4.02%, and 79.10% for the cropped images, 2.22%, 1.92%, and 88.34% for the original images, respectively. The strong positive correlation was also observed for cropped images (R = 0.9227) and original images (R = 0.9255) in comparison to labeled fat ratio.CONCLUSIONS: This new deep learning scheme may aid in the quantification of steatosis in the liver and facilitate its treatment by providing an earlier clinical diagnosis.

TI  - Monitoring of sedation in mechanically ventilated patients using remote technology
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review Two years of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted that excessive sedation in the ICU leading to coma and other adverse outcomes remains pervasive. There is a need to improve monitoring and management of sedation in mechanically ventilated patients. Remote technologies that are based on automated analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) could enhance standard care and alert clinicians real-time when severe EEG suppression or other abnormal brain states are detected. Recent findings High rates of drug-induced coma as well as delirium were found in several large cohorts of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, high doses of sedatives comparable to general anesthesia have been commonly administered without defined EEG endpoints. Continuous limited-channel EEG can reveal pathologic brain states such as burst suppression, that cannot be diagnosed by neurological examination alone. Recent studies documented that machine learning-based analysis of continuous EEG signal is feasible and that this approach can identify burst suppression as well as delirium with high specificity. Preventing oversedation in the ICU remains a challenge. Continuous monitoring of EEG activity, automated EEG analysis, and generation of alerts to clinicians may reduce drug-induced coma and potentially improve patient outcomes.

AB  - In this issue of the British Journal of Anaesthesia, Jiao and colleagues applied a neural network model for surgical case durations to predict the operating room times remaining for ongoing anaesthetics. We review estimation of case durations before each case starts, showing why their scientific focus is useful. We also describe managerial epidemiology studies of historical data by the scheduled procedure or distinct combinations of scheduled procedures included in each surgical case. Most cases have few or no historical data for the scheduled procedures. Generalizability of observational results such as theirs, and automatic computer assisted clinical and managerial decision-making, are both facilitated by using structured vocabularies when analysing surgical procedures.

TI  - Development of Guidance Techniques for Regional Anesthesia: Past, Present and Future
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Regional anesthesia has been widely used in clinical practice. Over the past 30 years, various guidance techniques have been developed for regional anesthesia ranging from paresthesia progressing to neurostimulation and currently ultrasound guidance. Especially, the use of point-of-care ultrasound greatly enhances the success rate of regional anesthesia. However, the poor imaging quality of ultrasound in patients with obesity, fat infiltration, etc., limits the use of ultrasound. The combined use of ultrasound with neurostimulator, electromyography, pressure monitoring, etc. is advocated in order to facilitate regional anesthesia in this cohort of patients. The accumulated evidence has shown that the ultrasound combined with other techniques (UCOT) can help to solve the difficulties of puncture location caused by obesity, anatomical variation, and other factors when using ultrasound guidance alone. In recent years, with the development of medical image fusion and medical image artificial intelligence identification technology, guidance techniques for regional anesthesia have advanced considerably. To understand the advantages and disadvantages of the various guidance techniques for regional anesthesia developed in recent years and to guide their rational clinical application, this paper reviews these techniques, describing the progression from the early use of paresthesia to the latest UCOT, as well as the latest research on UCOT, and the prospects for the development of new guidance techniques for regional anesthesia.

TI  - MMDCP: Multi-Modal Dental Caries Prediction for Decision Support System Using Deep Learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, healthcare has gained unprecedented attention from researchers in the field of Human health science and technology. Oral health, a subdomain of healthcare described as being very complex, is threatened by diseases like dental caries, gum disease, oral cancer, etc. The critical point is to propose an identification mechanism to prevent the population from being affected by these diseases. The large amount of online data allows scholars to perform tremendous research on health conditions, specifically oral health. Regardless of the high-performing dental consultation tools available in current healthcare, computer-based technology has shown the ability to complete some tasks in less time and cost less than when using similar healthcare tools to perform the same type of work. Machine learning has displayed a wide variety of advantages in oral healthcare, such as predicting dental caries in the population. Compared to the standard dental caries prediction previously proposed, this work emphasizes the importance of using multiple data sources, referred to as multi-modality, to extract more features and obtain accurate performances. The proposed prediction model constructed using multi-modal data demonstrated promising performances with an accuracy of 90%, F1-score of 89%, a recall of 90%, and a precision of 89%.

T2  - NEUROPHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anesthesia monitoring currently needs a reliable method to evaluate the effects of the anesthetics on its primary target, the brain. This study focuses on investigating the clinical usability of a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-derived machine learning classifier to perform automated and real-time classification of maintenance and emergence states during sevoflurane anesthesia. For 19 surgical procedures, we examine the entire continuum of the maintenance-transition-emergence phases and evaluate the predictive capability of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier during these phases. We demonstrate the robustness of the predictions made by the SVM classifier and compare its performance with that of minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and bispectral (BIS) index-based predictions. The fNIRS-SVM investigated in this study provides evidence to the usability of the fNIRS signal for anesthesia monitoring. The method presented enables classification of the signal as maintenance or emergence automatically as well as in real-time with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The features local mean HbTotal, std HbO(2), local min Hb and HbO(2), and range Hb and HbO(2) were found to be robust biomarkers of this binary classification task. Furthermore, fNIRS-SVM was capable of identifying emergence before movement in a larger number of patients than BIS and MAC. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB  - In hospitals, patients often experience falls at night, especially when they're under the influence of painkillers and anesthesia. Instead of seeking assistance, these patients, in their confused state, might impulsively try to get up, endangering their safety. Such incidents can lead to severe injuries, even fatalities, or cases where patients wander away from their rooms. These occurrences not only impact the health of the patients but also increase insurance costs for hospitals. Centro Chirurgico Toscano (CCT - Tuscany Surgery Center) and the Interaction Design Lab of the University of Siena have explored a fall prevention system using Machine Learning (ML) and image recognition. This system, installed in a CCT room, monitors patients' positions in real-time (whether they're lying, sitting, or standing) and raises an alert for any risky postures. The project favored a human-centered approach to meet the specific needs of stakeholders. The setting of the fall prevention system, and four dashboards to view, control, manage and modify the system, were co-designed for and with the CCT. The tested system has shown reliability, leading to considerations for its broader application. The goal is to promote a preventive culture in health care by leveraging technologies such as image recognition to minimize fall risks.

TI  - Artificial intelligence technology and ultrasound-guided nerve block for analgesia in total knee arthroplasty
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Knee diseases are more common in middle-aged and elderly people, so artificial knee replacement is also more used in middle-aged and elderly people. Although the patient's pain can be reduced through surgery, often accompanied by moderate pain after surgery and neutralization, which not only increases the psychological burden of the patient, but also greatly reduces the postoperative recovery effect, and may also lead to the occurrence of postoperative adverse events in severe cases.AIM To investigate the analgesic effect of artificial intelligence (AI) and ultrasound-guided nerve block in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS A total of 92 patients with TKA admitted to our hospital from January 2021 to January 2022 were opted and divided into two groups according to the treatment regimen. The control group received combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. The research group received AI technique combined with ultrasound-guided nerve block anesthesia. The sensory block time, motor block time, visual analogue scale (VAS) at different time points and complications were contrasted between the two groups. RESULTS The time of sensory block onset and sensory block perfection in the research group was shorter than those in the control group, but the results had no significant difference (P > 0.05). Duration of sensory block in the research group was significantly longer than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The time of motor block onset and motor block perfection in the research group was shorter than those in the control group, but the results had no significant difference (P > 0.05). Duration of motor block in the research group was significantly longer than those in the control group. The VAS scales of the research group were significantly lower than that of the control group at different time points (P < 0.05). The postoperative hip flexion and abduction range of motion in the research group were significantly better than those in the control group at different time points (P < 0.05). The incidence of complications was significantly lower in the research group than in the control group (P = 0.049). CONCLUSION In TKA, the combination of AI technology and ultrasound-guided nerve block has a significantly effect, with fewer postoperative complications and significantly analgesic effect, which is worthy of application.

TI  - Pediatric magnetic resonance imaging: faster is better
T2  - PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as the preferred imaging modality for evaluating a wide range of pediatric medical conditions. Nevertheless, the long acquisition times associated with this technique can limit its widespread use in young children, resulting in motion-degraded or non-diagnostic studies. As a result, sedation or general anesthesia is often necessary to obtain diagnostic images, which has implications for the safety profile of MRI, the cost of the exam and the radiology department's clinical workflow. Over the last decade, several techniques have been developed to increase the speed of MRI, including parallel imaging, single-shot acquisition, controlled aliasing techniques, compressed sensing and artificial-intelligence-based reconstructions. These are advantageous because shorter examinations decrease the need for sedation and the severity of motion artifacts, increase scanner throughput, and improve system efficiency. In this review we discuss a framework for image acceleration in children that includes the synergistic use of state-of-the-art MRI hardware and optimized pulse sequences. The discussion is framed within the context of pediatric radiology and incorporates the authors' experience in deploying these techniques in routine clinical practice.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of a New Depth of Anesthesia Index in ConView® System and the Bispectral Index during Total Intravenous Anesthesia: A Multicenter Clinical Trial
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of a new monitor for the depth of anesthesia (DOA), the Depth of Anesthesia Index (Ai) based on sample entropy (SampEn), 95% spectral edge frequency (95%SEF), and burst suppression ratio (BSR) was evaluated compared to Bispectral Index (BIS) during total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). 144 patients in six medical centers were enrolled. General anesthesia was induced with stepwise-increased target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol until loss of consciousness (LOC). During surgery propofol was titrated according to BIS. Both Ai and BIS were recorded. Primary outcomes: the limits of agreement between Ai and BIS were -17.68 and 16.49, which were, respectively, -30.0% and 28.0% of the mean value of BIS. Secondary outcomes: prediction probability (Pk) of BIS and Ai was 0.943 and 0.935 (p=0.102) during LOC and 0.928 and 0.918 (p=0.037) during recovery of consciousness (ROC). And the values of BIS and Ai were 68.19 and 66.44 at 50%LOC, and 76.65 and 78.60 at 50%ROC. A decrease or an increase of Ai was significantly greater than that of BIS when consciousness changes (during LOC: -9.13 +/- 10.20 versus -5.83 +/- 9.63, p<0.001; during ROC: 10.88 +/- 11.51 versus 5.32 +/- 7.53, p<0.001). The conclusion is that Ai has similar characteristic of BIS as a DOA monitor and revealed the advantage of SampEn for indicating conscious level. This trial is registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry with ChiCTR-IOR-16009471.

TI  - Machine learning for a combined electroencephalographic anesthesia index to detect awareness under anesthesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and auditory evoked potentials (AEP) have been suggested to monitor the level of consciousness during anesthesia. As both signals reflect different neuronal pathways, a combination of parameters from both signals may provide broader information about the brain status during anesthesia. Appropriate parameter selection and combination to a single index is crucial to take advantage of this potential. The field of machine learning offers algorithms for both parameter selection and combination. In this study, several established machine learning approaches including a method for the selection of suitable signal parameters and classification algorithms are applied to construct an index which predicts responsiveness in anesthetized patients. The present analysis considers several classification algorithms, among those support vector machines, artificial neural networks and Bayesian learning algorithms. On the basis of data from the transition between consciousness and unconsciousness, a combination of EEG and AEP signal parameters developed with automated methods provides a maximum prediction probability of 0.935, which is higher than 0.916 (for EEG parameters) and 0.880 (for AEP parameters) using a cross-validation approach. This suggests that machine learning techniques can successfully be applied to develop an improved combined EEG and AEP parameter to separate consciousness from unconsciousness.

T2  - Journal of Image and Graphics
M3  - Review
AB  - Medical big data mainly include electronic health record data,such as medical imaging data and genetic information data,among which medical imaging data takes up the most of medical data currently.One of the problems that researchers in computer science are greatly concerned about is how to apply medical big data in clinical practice.Artificial intelligence (AI) provides a good way to address this problem.AI algorithms,particularly deep learning,have demonstrated remarkable progress in image-recognition tasks.Historically,in radiology practice,trained physicians visually assess medical images for the detection,characterization,and monitoring of diseases.AI methods excel at automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and providing quantitative,rather than qualitative,assessments of radiographic characteristics.Methods ranging from convolutional neural networks to variational autoencoders have found myriad applications in the medical image analysis field,propelling it forward at a rapid pace.In this review,by combining recent work and the latest research progress of big data analysis of medical images until 2020,we have summarized the theory,main process,and evaluation results of multiple deep learning algorithms in some fields of medical image analysis,including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),pathology imaging,ultrasound imaging,electrical signals,digital radiography,molybdenum target,and diabetic eye imaging,using deep learning.MRI is one of the main research areas of medical image analysis.The existing research literature includes Alzheimer's disease MRI,Parkinson's disease MRI,brain tumor MRI,prostate cancer MRI,and cardiac MRI.MRI is also divided into two-dimensional and three-dimensional image analysis,especially for three-dimensional data,where insufficient data volume leads to problems such as overfitting,large calculations,and slow training.Medical ultrasound (also known as diagnostic sonography or ultrasonography) is a diagnostic imaging technique or therapeutic application of ultrasound.It is used to create an image of internal body structures such as tendons,muscles,joints,blood vessels,and internal organs.It aims to find the source of a disease or to exclude pathology.The practice of examining pregnant women using ultrasound is called obstetric ultrasonography and was an early development and application of clinical ultrasonography.Ultrasonography uses sound waves with higher frequencies than those audible to humans(>20 000 Hz).Ultrasonic images,also known as sonograms,are made by sending ultrasound pulses into the tissue using a probe.The ultrasound pulses echo off tissues with different reflection properties and are recorded and displayed as an image.Many different types of images can be formed.The most common is a B-mode image (brightness),which displays the acoustic impedance of a two-dimensional cross-section of a tissue.Other types can display blood flow,tissue motion over time,the location of blood,the presence of specific molecules,the stiffness of a tissue,or the anatomy of a three-dimensional region.Pathology is the gold standard for diagnosing some diseases,especially digital image of pathology.We specifically discuss AI combined with digital pathology images for diagnosis.Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record the electrical activity of the brain.It is typically noninvasive,with the electrodes placed along the scalp.However,invasive electrodes are sometimes used,for example in electrocorticography,sometimes called intracranial EEG.EEG is most often used to diagnose epilepsy,which causes abnormalities in EEG readings.It is also used to diagnose sleep disorders,depth of anesthesia,coma,encephalopathies,and brain death.EEG used to be a first-line method of diagnosis for tumors,stroke,and other focal brain disorders,but its use has decreased with the advent of high-resolution anatomical imaging techniques such as MRI and computed tomography (CT).

AB  - Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia (UGRA) becomes a standard procedure in surgical operations and contributes to pain management. It offers the advantages of the targeted nerve detection and provides the visualization of regions of interest such as anatomical structures. However, nerve detection is one of the most challenging tasks that anesthetists can encounter in the UGRA procedure. A computer-aided system that can detect automatically the nerve region would facilitate the anesthetist's daily routine and allow them to concentrate more on the anesthetic delivery. In this paper, we propose a new method based on merging deep learning models from different data to detect the median nerve. The merged architecture consists of two branches, one being one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural networks (CNN) branch and another 2D CNN branch. The merged architecture aims to learn the high-level features from 1D handcrafted noise-robust features and 2D ultrasound images. The obtained results show the validity and high accuracy of the proposed approach and its robustness.

TI  - An EEG-Based Hypnotic State Monitor for Patients During General Anesthesia
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (VLSI) SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most surgical procedures are not possible without general anesthesia which necessitates continuous and accurate monitoring of the patients' level of hypnosis (LoH). Currently, the LoH is monitored using the conventional methods of either observing the patient's physiological parameters or using electroencephalogram (EEG)-based monitors. To overcome the limitations of the conventional methods, this work implements an accurate EEG-based LoH monitoring processor using a bagged tree machine-learning (BTML) classifier. It is based on 12 temporal and spectral features to incorporate robustness against age variation and achieve high classification accuracy. Spectral features are computed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) that uses time-multiplexed filter (TMF) architecture. The TMF DWT consumes 110.6-nJ/feature vector for a 100-tap filter while reducing the area by 11% compared with the conventional method. Moreover, the BTML is implemented using a pipelined approach which enables an efficient on-chip implementation to reduce the hardware cost by 15x compared with the parallel approach. The proposed processor is implemented using a 180-nm CMOS process with an active area of 0.9 mm(2) while consuming 1.6 mW. The accuracy of the proposed hypnotic state monitor is verified using two EEG databases with a total of 95 patients and achieves a sensitivity and specificity of 95.4% and 97.7%, respectively.

TI  - Contemporary training methods in regional anaesthesia: fundamentals and innovations
T2  - ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the past two decades, regional anaesthesia and medical education as a whole have undergone a renaissance. Significant changes in our teaching methods and clinical practice have been influenced by improvements in our theoretical understanding as well as by technological innovations. More recently, there has been a focus on using foundational education principles to teach regional anaesthesia, and the evidence on how to best teach and assess trainees is growing. This narrative review will discuss fundamentals and innovations in regional anaesthesia training. We present the fundamentals in regional anaesthesia training, specifically the current state of simulation-based education, deliberate practice and curriculum design based on competency-based progression. Moving into the future, we present the latest innovations in web-based learning, emerging technologies for teaching and assessment and new developments in alternate reality learning systems.

TI  - Machine Learning Models of Post-Intubation Hypoxia During General Anesthesia
T2  - GERMAN MEDICAL DATA SCIENCES: VISIONS AND BRIDGES
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 62nd Annual Meeting of the German-Association-of-Medical-Informatics-Biometry-and-Epidemiology
CL  - Oldenburg, GERMANY
AB  - Fine-meshed perioperative measurements are offering enormous potential for automatically investigating clinical complications during general anesthesia. In this study, we employed multiple machine learning methods to model perioperative hypoxia and compare their respective capabilities. After exporting and visualizing 620 series of perioperative vital signs, we had ten anesthesiologists annotate the subjective presence and severity of temporary post-intubation oxygen desaturation. We then applied specific clustering and prediction methods on the acquired annotations, and evaluated their performance in comparison to the inter-rater agreement between experts. When reproducing the expert annotations, the sensitivity and specificity of multi-layer neural networks substantially outperformed clustering and simpler threshold-based methods. The achieved performance of our best automated hypoxia models thereby approximately equaled the observed agreement between different medical experts. Furthermore, we deployed our classification methods for processing unlabeled inputs to estimate the incidence of hypoxic episodes in another sizeable patient cohort, which attests to the feasibility of using the approach on a larger scale. We interpret that our machine learning models could be instrumental for computerized observational studies of the clinical determinants of post-intubation oxygen deficiency. Future research might also investigate potential benefits of more advanced preprocessing approaches such as automated feature learning.

TI  - Supervised Machine-learning Predictive Analytics for Prediction of Postinduction Hypotension
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hypotension is a risk factor for adverse perioperative outcomes. Machine-learning methods allow large amounts of data for development of robust predictive analytics. The authors hypothesized that machine-learning methods can provide prediction for the risk of postinduction hypotension.Methods: Data was extracted from the electronic health record of a single quaternary care center from November 2015 to May 2016 for patients over age 12 that underwent general anesthesia, without procedure exclusions. Multiple supervised machine-learning classification techniques were attempted, with postinduction hypotension (mean arterial pressure less than 55 mmHg within 10 min of induction by any measurement) as primary outcome, and preoperative medications, medical comorbidities, induction medications, and intraoperative vital signs as features. Discrimination was assessed using cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The best performing model was tuned and final performance assessed using split-set validation.Results: Out of 13,323 cases, 1,185 (8.9%) experienced postinduction hypotension. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using logistic regression was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.72), support vector machines was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.60), naive Bayes was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.69), k-nearest neighbor was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.65), linear discriminant analysis was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.73), random forest was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.75), neural nets 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.71), and gradient boosting machine 0.76 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.77). Test set area for the gradient boosting machine was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.77).Conclusions: The success of this technique in predicting postinduction hypotension demonstrates feasibility of machine-learning models for predictive analytics in the field of anesthesiology, with performance dependent on model selection and appropriate tuning.

T2  - CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study aimed to investigate the effects of combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) with acupoint injection (AI) on the maternal-fetal expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-10 (IL-10), analgesia effect, and labor outcomes.Methods: A total of 360 healthy primiparas were randomized into the CSEA+AI group, the CSEA group, the AI group, and the control group (n = 90, each group) according to the labor analgesia methods.Results: Compared to the CSEA group, the CSEA+AI group had significantly lower visual analog scale (VAS) scores, adverse events, dose of ropivacaine/sufentanil, and shorter labor durations. The IL-1 beta/IL-10 ratio in maternal peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood was reduced in the CSEA+AI group compared with the CSEA group.Conclusion: The combination of CSEA and AI can reduce the ratio of IL-1 beta/ IL-10 in maternal peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood, which can effectively relieve labor pain.

TI  - Closed-Loop Pharmacologic Control of Blood Pressure: A Review of Existing Systems
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Blood pressure management is a critical aspect of patient care, particularly in surgical and critical care settings. Closed-loop systems, which utilize real-time data and feedback to adjust treatment interventions, have gained attention for their potential to enhance blood pressure control. This review explores the application of closed-loop systems in blood pressure management. We discuss various closed-loop approaches, including their mechanisms, benefits, and limitations. By harnessing real-time patient data and feedback, closed-loop systems can tailor interventions dynamically, thus enhancing blood pressure regulation. Additionally, we examine the integration of advanced monitoring technologies and artificial intelligence algorithms in closed-loop systems. The review highlights recent studies and their findings, emphasizing the evolving landscape of closed-loop blood pressure management across different clinical scenarios. From the perioperative period to critical care settings, closed-loop systems hold the potential to optimize patient outcomes by precisely adjusting vasopressor administration in response to continuous blood pressure fluctuations. By providing insights into the current state of closed-loop systems for blood pressure control, this review offers a comprehensive overview of their potential contributions to improved patient outcomes and future directions for research and implementation.

AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a red blood cell disorder complicated by lifelong issues with pain. Management of SCD related pain is particularly challenging due to its subjective nature. Hence, the development of an objective automatic pain assessment method is critical to pain management in SCD. In this work, we developed a continuous pain assessment model using physiological and body movement sensor signals collected from a wearable wrist-worn device. Specifically, we implemented ensemble feature selection methods to select robust and stable features extracted from wearable data for better understanding of pain. Our experiments showed that the stability of feature selection methods could be substantially increased by using the ensemble approach. Since different ensemble feature selection methods prefer varying feature subsets for pain estimation, we further utilized stacked generalization to maximize the information usage contained in the selected features from different methods. Using this approach, our best performing model obtained the root-mean-square error of 1.526 and the Pearson correlation of 0.618 for continuous pain assessment. This indicates that subjective pain scores can be estimated using objective wearable sensor data with high precision.

TI  - Artificial intelligence for pain classification with the non-invasive pain monitor Anspec-Pro
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA BELGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Reliable measurement of perioperative pain is still an ongoing problem. Pain monitors are commercially available, but to date are not commonly used clinically. Anspec-Pro was developed as a new pain monitor device by Ghent University in 2018. The validation study compared this monitor to the commercially available and validated MedStorm pain monitor. Although the results were comparable with the validated monitor, the absolute results were debatable.Objectives: The data were reanalyzed by means of artificial intelligence (AI), examining the correlation and prediction between the measured data and clinical parameters, to explore if this delivers complementary information that assists pain assessment.Design and setting: A cohort study at Ghent University Hospital.Methods: During two monitoring periods, data were collected from patients while measuring pain with Anspec-Pro. Patients were monitored in the preoperative period and during their postoperative recovery. Measurements by Anspec-Pro were processed with AI, more specifically with a convolutional neural network ( CNN), and classified into pain classes. CNN's were trained both with offline (training prior to monitoring) and online (offline training followed by real-time retraining with incoming data) training methods. Performance was assessed with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.Main outcome measures: Pain values as quantified by Anspec-Pro and NRS values as reported by the patients.Results: Data from 11 patients were used for analysis. Good device performance was seen with offline training with all data and with online retraining every seven minutes with device output and an NRS from the last seven minutes.Conclusions: CNN online training with recent patient data led to good algorithm performance. Hence, our results indicate that there is a potential for AI to deliver useful information that can be used in complementary models of monitoring devices.

TI  - Identifying Modifiable Cost Drivers of Outpatient Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty With Machine Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTHROPLASTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Implementing tools that identify cost-saving opportunities for ambulatory orthopaedic surgeries can improve access to value-based care. We developed and internally validated a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict cost drivers of total charges after ambulatory unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA).Methods: We queried the New York State Ambulatory Surgery and Services database to identify patients who underwent ambulatory, defined as <24 hours of care before discharge, elective UKA between 2014 and 2016. A total of 1,311 patients were included. The median costs after ambulatory UKA were $14,710. Patient demographics and intraoperative parameters were entered into 4 candidate ML algorithms. The most predictive model was selected following internal validation of candidate models, with conventional linear regression as a benchmark. Global variable importance and partial dependence curves were constructed to determine the impact of each input parameter on total charges.Results: The gradient-boosted ensemble model outperformed all candidate algorithms and conventional linear regression. The major differential cost drivers of UKA identified (in decreasing order of magnitude) were increased operating room time, length of stay, use of regional and adjunctive periarticular anal-gesia, utilization of computer-assisted navigation, and routinely sending resected tissue to pathology.Conclusion: We developed and internally validated a supervised ML algorithm that identified operating room time, length of stay, use of computer-assisted navigation, regional primary anesthesia, adjunct periarticular analgesia, and routine surgical pathology as essential cost drivers of UKA. Following external validation, this tool may enable surgeons and health insurance providers optimize the delivery of value -based care to patients receiving outpatient UKA.

TI  - Application of a Remotely Controlled Artificial Intelligence Analgesic Pump Device in Painless Treatment of Children (Retracted Article)
T2  - CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - In order to effectively improve the application of analgesic pump devices in the treatment of children, a method based on remote control artificial intelligence is proposed. 100 children with dental pulpitis who were treated in a hospital from December 2018 to December 2020 were selected as the research subjects; they were randomly divided into control group and observation group by an equidistant sampling method, with 50 cases in each group. Children in the control group were given articaine and adrenaline anesthesia, and the observation group was treated with articaine and adrenaline combined with a computer-controlled anesthesia system, the anesthesia pain degree and satisfaction degree of the two groups of children were observed and compared. The results showed that the pain score in anesthesia and intraoperative pain score in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The total satisfaction of 96.6% patients in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (84.7%) and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There were no serious complications in both groups. The application of the computer anesthesia system combined with articaine adrenaline in the painless treatment of children's dental pulp proved to have better effects, the treatment compliance is higher, and it is worthy of clinical promotion.

AB  - DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for chronic low back pain. However, only half of Veterans have access to trained CBT therapists, and program expansion is costly. Moreover, VA CBT programs consist of 10 weekly hour-long sessions delivered using an approach that is out-of-sync with stepped-care models designed to ensure that scarce resources are used as effectively and efficiently as possible. Data from prior CBT trials have documented substantial variation in patients' needs for extended treatment, and the characteristics of effective programs vary significantly. Some patients improve after the first fewsessions while others need more extensive contact. After initially establishing a behavioral plan, still other Veterans may be able to reach behavioral and symptom goals using a personalized combination of manuals, shorter follow-up contacts with a therapist, and automated telephone monitoring and self-care support calls. In partnership with the National Pain Management Program, we propose to apply state-of-the-art principles from "reinforcement learning" (a field of artificial intelligence or AI used successfully in robotics and on-line consumer targeting) to develop an evidence-based, personalized CBT pain management service that automatically adapts to each Veteran's unique and changing needs (AI- CBT). AI-CBT will use feedback from patients about their progress in pain-related functioning measured daily via pedometer step-counts to automatically personalize the intensity and type of patient support; thereby ensuring that scarce therapist resources are used as efficiently as possible and potentially allowing programs with fixed budgets to serve many more Veterans. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) demonstrate that AI-CBT has non-inferior pain-related outcomes compared to standard telephone CBT; (2) document that AI-CBT achieves these outcomes with more efficient use of scarce clinician resources as evidenced by less overall therapist time and no increase in the use of other VA health services; and (3) demonstrate the intervention's impact on proximal outcomes associated with treatment response, including program engagement, pain management skill acquisition, satisfaction with care, and patients' likelihood of dropout. We will use qualitative interviews with patients, clinicians, and VA operational partners to ensure that the service has features that maximize scalability, broad scale adoption, and impact. 278 patients with chronic low back pain will be recruited from the VA Connecticut Healthcare System and the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, and randomized to standard 10-sessions of telephone CBT versus AI-CBT. All patients will begin with weekly hour-long telephone counseling, but for patients in the AI-CBT group, those who demonstrate a significant treatment response will be stepped down through less resource-intensive alternatives to hour-long contacts, including: (a) 15 minute contacts with a therapist, and (b) CBT clinician feedback provided via interactive voice response calls (IVR). The AI engine will learn what works best in terms of patients' personally-tailored treatment plan based on daily feedback via IVR about patients' pedometer-measured step counts as well as their CBT skill practice and physical functioning. The AI algorithm we will use is designed to be as efficient as possible, so that the system can learn what works best for a given patient based on the collective experience of other similar patients as well as the individual's own history. Our hypothesis is that AI-CBT will resultin pain-related functional outcomes that are no worse (and possibly better) than the standard approach, but by scaling back the intensity of contact that is not resulting in marginal gains in pain control, the AI-CBT approach will be significantly less costly in terms of therapy time. Secondary hypotheses are that AI-CBT will result in greater patient engagement and patient satisfaction. Outcomes will be measured at three and six months post recruitment and will include pain-related interference, treatment satisfaction, and treatment dropout.

AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The system (100) has a processor (104). An                interface (108,130) is configured to receive a                first set of patient data in real-time from the                sensor monitoring vital signals of a patient during                a surgical procedure and a second set of patient                data in real-time from an anesthesia machine (124)                during the surgical procedure. An input interface                receives an indicator representing an identity of a                therapeutic to be administered to the patient. A                machine learning model (140) determines from the                indicator that the first set of patient data and                the second set of patient data if an alert can be                provided to a user.

TI  - SCH: INT: Anesthesiology Control Tower: Forecasting Algorithms to Support Treatment (ACTFAST)

AB  - There is a significant public health concern in the United States regarding major complications and death following surgery. Forty million Americans undergo surgery yearly. Approximately five percent die within a year of their operation, and roughly ten percent suffer major in-hospital morbidity (e.g., stroke, heart attack, pneumonia, renal failure, wound infection). Early recognition of risk and appropriate management could often prevent or modify these adverse outcomes. We believe that this represents an exciting scientific opportunity. Modern intraoperative monitoring yields a wealth of data from thousands of operating rooms across the US.  Integration and real-time analysis of these data streams has the potential to revolutionize perioperative care. We propose to develop, validate and assess machine-learning, forecasting algorithms that predict adverse outcomes for individual patients. The forecasting algorithms will be based on data derived from various sources, including the patient's electronic medical record, the array of physiological monitors in the operating room, and evidence-based scientific literature. These algorithms will facilitate patient-specific clinical decision support, utilizing an innovative approach of an anesthesiology control tower. The anesthesiology control tower for the operating room will be conceptually similar to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. We are optimistic that the ambitious goal of developing forecasting algorithms for individual surgical patients can be realized, since members of our team have already developed and validated similar forecasting algorithms for critically ill hospital patients. Modifiable risk factors for adverse events could be detected early during surgery, allowing targeted interventions and preventive measures. The ACTFAST study will provide important information on the potential utility of incorporating forecasting algorithms into routine surgical care, including in under-resourced healthcare settings. This project will also yield important educational benefits. There will be tremendous learning for the students who help to develop and validate the forecasting algorithms. Furthermore, the control tower concept is a disruptive educational innovation, which will equip anesthesiology trainees with a new ability to provide simultaneous care to multiple surgical patients. It is notoriously difficult to construct high fidelity scientific models for individual humans, as we are complex biological systems. Ultimately, the success of this ambitious project, which engages interdisciplinary perspectives and applies sophisticated forecasting algorithms to clinical decision support, will have substantial scientific and clinical impact.<br/><br/>Modern intraoperative monitoring yields a wealth of data from thousands of operating rooms across the United States.  Integration and real-time analysis of these data streams has the potential to revolutionize perioperative care. The objective for this investigation is to exploit our experience in running innovative machine learning algorithms, including filtering and outcome-related models, in order to build forecasting algorithms tailored to individual surgical patients. Our central hypothesis is that with sufficient knowledge of patient characteristics coupled with repeated, high-fidelity time series data from the intraoperative electronic medical record, advanced models can be constructed for individual patients that will forecast risk for adverse postoperative outcomes. First, using a training dataset, we will apply data mining and machine-learning methods that we have previously validated to extract useful information from electronic health records and real-time physiological variables. We will develop algorithms using hybrid-learning techniques to combine the strength of non-parametric (generative) models, such as histogram and kernel density estimation, and parametric (discriminative) models, such as support vector machines, logistic regressions, and kernel machines to improve predictions of adverse perioperative outcomes. The goal is to deliver superior prediction quality, with good interpretability and high computational efficiency, that supports fast processing of big data. Second, using a testing dataset, we will validate the predictive accuracy of the developed algorithms, by determining the reliability in forecasting adverse outcomes. The developed algorithms will be tested for accuracy of their predictive performance. These evaluation methods include hold-out sampling, cross-validation, and bootstrap sampling. After being trained and tested, the performance of the developed algorithms will be additionally validated prospectively (out-of-sample performance), using standard measures of accuracy, precision and robustness. We envision that the developed algorithms will facilitate patient-specific clinical decision support, utilizing an innovative approach of an anesthesiology control tower, which will be conceptually similar to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The main contributions of this project will include: (1) new machine-learning algorithms for forecasting perioperative adverse events from heterogeneous, multi-scale, and high-dimensional data streams; (2) a clinical decision support system that identifies prognostic factors and suggests interventions based on novel feature ranking algorithms; and (3) a transformative approach to the education of the anesthesiology team and the paradigm of perioperative care. Successfully advancing real-time analytic methods and modeling for individual surgical patients, using heterogeneous and sparse data, would have tremendous scientific and societal impact.

AB  - DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for chronic low back pain. However, only half of Veterans have access to trained CBT therapists, and program expansion is costly. Moreover, VA CBT programs consist of 10 weekly hour-long sessions delivered using an approach that is out-of-sync with stepped-care models designed to ensure that scarce resources are used as effectively and efficiently as possible. Data from prior CBT trials have documented substantial variation in patients' needs for extended treatment, and the characteristics of effective programs vary significantly. Some patients improve after the first fewsessions while others need more extensive contact. After initially establishing a behavioral plan, still other Veterans may be able to reach behavioral and symptom goals using a personalized combination of manuals, shorter follow-up contacts with a therapist, and automated telephone monitoring and self-care support calls. In partnership with the National Pain Management Program, we propose to apply state-of-the-art principles from "reinforcement learning" (a field of artificial intelligence or AI used successfully in robotics and on-line consumer targeting) to develop an evidence-based, personalized CBT pain management service that automatically adapts to each Veteran's unique and changing needs (AI- CBT). AI-CBT will use feedback from patients about their progress in pain-related functioning measured daily via pedometer step-counts to automatically personalize the intensity and type of patient support; thereby ensuring that scarce therapist resources are used as efficiently as possible and potentially allowing programs with fixed budgets to serve many more Veterans. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) demonstrate that AI-CBT has non-inferior pain-related outcomes compared to standard telephone CBT; (2) document that AI-CBT achieves these outcomes with more efficient use of scarce clinician resources as evidenced by less overall therapist time and no increase in the use of other VA health services; and (3) demonstrate the intervention's impact on proximal outcomes associated with treatment response, including program engagement, pain management skill acquisition, satisfaction with care, and patients' likelihood of dropout. We will use qualitative interviews with patients, clinicians, and VA operational partners to ensure that the service has features that maximize scalability, broad scale adoption, and impact. 278 patients with chronic low back pain will be recruited from the VA Connecticut Healthcare System and the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, and randomized to standard 10-sessions of telephone CBT versus AI-CBT. All patients will begin with weekly hour-long telephone counseling, but for patients in the AI-CBT group, those who demonstrate a significant treatment response will be stepped down through less resource-intensive alternatives to hour-long contacts, including: (a) 15 minute contacts with a therapist, and (b) CBT clinician feedback provided via interactive voice response calls (IVR). The AI engine will learn what works best in terms of patients' personally-tailored treatment plan based on daily feedback via IVR about patients' pedometer-measured step counts as well as their CBT skill practice and physical functioning. The AI algorithm we will use is designed to be as efficient as possible, so that the system can learn what works best for a given patient based on the collective experience of other similar patients as well as the individual's own history. Our hypothesis is that AI-CBT will resultin pain-related functional outcomes that are no worse (and possibly better) than the standard approach, but by scaling back the intensity of contact that is not resulting in marginal gains in pain control, the AI-CBT approach will be significantly less costly in terms of therapy time. Secondary hypotheses are that AI-CBT will result in greater patient engagement and patient satisfaction. Outcomes will be measured at three and six months post recruitment and will include pain-related interference, treatment satisfaction, and treatment dropout.

TI  - INDIVIDUALIZED RISK ASSESSMENT OF PREOPERATIVE OPIOID USE BY INTERPRETABLE NEURAL NETWORK REGRESSION
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Preoperative opioid use has been reported to be associated with higher preoperative opioid demand, worse postoperative outcomes, and increased postoperative healthcare utilization and expenditures. Understanding the risk of preoperative opioid use helps establish patient-centered pain management. In the field of machine learning, deep neural network (DNN) has emerged as a powerful means for risk assessment because of its superb prediction power; however, the blackbox algorithms may make the results less interpretable than statistical models. Bridging the gap between the statistical and machine learning fields, we propose a novel interpretable neural network regression (INNER) which combines the strengths of statistical and DNN models. We use the proposed INNER to conduct individualized risk assessment of pre-operative opioid use. Intensive simulations and an analysis of 34,186 patients expecting surgery in the Analgesic Outcomes Study (AOS) show that the pro-posed INNER not only can accurately predict the preoperative opioid use using preoperative characteristics as DNN but also can estimate the patient -specific odds of opioid use without pain and the odds ratio of opioid use for a unit increase in the reported overall body pain, leading to more straight-forward interpretations of the tendency to use opioids than DNN. Our results identify the patient characteristics that are strongly associated with opioid use and is largely consistent with the previous findings, providing evidence that INNER is a useful tool for individualized risk assessment of preoperative opioid use.

TI  - Deep learning for anatomical interpretation of video bronchoscopy images
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anesthesiologists commonly use video bronchoscopy to facilitate intubation or confirm the location of the endotracheal tube; however, depth and orientation in the bronchial tree can often be confused because anesthesiologists cannot trace the airway from the oropharynx when it is performed using an endotracheal tube. Moreover, the decubitus position is often used in certain surgeries. Although it occurs rarely, the misinterpretation of tube location can cause accidental extubation or endobronchial intubation, which can lead to hyperinflation. Thus, video bronchoscopy with a decision supporting system using artificial intelligence would be useful in the anesthesiologic process. In this study, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model robust to rotation and covering using video bronchoscopy images. We collected video bronchoscopic images from an institutional database. Collected images were automatically labeled by an optical character recognition engine as the carina and left/right main bronchus. Except 180 images for the evaluation dataset, 80% were randomly allocated to the training dataset. The remaining images were assigned to the validation and test datasets in a 7:3 ratio. Random image rotation and circular cropping were applied. Ten kinds of pretrained models with < 25 million parameters were trained on the training and validation datasets. The model showing the best prediction accuracy for the test dataset was selected as the final model. Six human experts reviewed the evaluation dataset for the inference of anatomical locations to compare its performance with that of the final model. In the experiments, 8688 images were prepared and assigned to the evaluation (180), training (6806), validation (1191), and test (511) datasets. The EfficientNetB1 model showed the highest accuracy (0.86) and was selected as the final model. For the evaluation dataset, the final model showed better performance (accuracy, 0.84) than almost all human experts (0.38, 0.44, 0.51, 0.68, and 0.63), and only the most-experienced pulmonologist showed performance comparable (0.82) with that of the final model. The performance of human experts was generally proportional to their experiences. The performance difference between anesthesiologists and pulmonologists was marked in discrimination of the right main bronchus. Using bronchoscopic images, our model could distinguish anatomical locations among the carina and both main bronchi under random rotation and covering. The performance was comparable with that of the most-experienced human expert. This model can be a basis for designing a clinical decision support system with video bronchoscopy.

AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACTChronic opioid usage after surgery is a major contributor to the opioid epidemic, which poses amajor crisis in public health. 51 million patients undergo surgery each year in the United States.Between 9-13% of surgical patients continue chronic use of opioids, leading to opioid use disorderin 8-12% of cases of chronic use. However, under half of surgical patients report adequatepostoperative pain relief, which hinders recovery, increasing mortality, and length of stay. Bestoutcomes require personalization of treatment from patient to patient, accounting for thedetrimental effects of both excessive opioid administration and uncontrolled pain. However,current clinical guidelines on pain management do not provide clear guidance on how best toadjust courses of treatment. Moreover, assessment of pain is reliant upon patient self-report, andis hindered when patients are sedated or have altered mental status.This project seeks to quantitatively understand the relationships which govern the efficacy of post-operative pain management strategies, and to characterize how different real-time physiologicalmeasures may be used to assess pain and opioid requirements. This will be accomplishedthrough the analysis of a large dataset of electronic health record data from over 100,000 surgicalprocedures performed at Massachusetts General Hospital, as well as intraoperativeelectroencephalogram (EEG) recordings for a subset of several thousand of these procedures.Aim 1 of this project is to model analgesic response to opioids, identifying cases of excessive aswell as inadequate opioid usage. We propose to model pain evolution over time using neuralordinary differential equation models, and to use learned dynamics to compute optimal treatmentpolicies. Aim 2 of this project is to identify cases where can be improved through usage of non-opioid treatment modalities. This can also be accomplished through modeling of pain dynamics,or through statistical analyses of the outcomes of cohorts of patients receiving different treatmentmodalities. Aim 3 of this project is to compute intraoperative correlates of postoperative pain statefrom EEG data. Signal processing methods as well as deep learning will be used to extractfeatures from EEG data related to sedation, loss of consciousness, and pain. We will also studythe relationship between intraoperative interventions and postoperative outcomes.This project has the potential to reduce excess opioid usage and improve pain management,improving post-surgical clinical outcomes and reducing the incidence of opioid abuse disorder.Our results will also provide the ability to objectively assess pain and treatment requirements.

TI  - Feasibility of Deep Learning Algorithms for Reporting in Routine Spine Magnetic Resonance Imaging
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPINE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence is gaining traction in automated medical imaging analysis. Development of more accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predictors of successful clinical outcomes is necessary to better define indications for surgery, improve clinical outcomes with targeted minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures, and realize cost savings by avoiding more invasive spine care.Objective: To demonstrate the ability for deep learning neural network models to identify features in MRI DICOM datasets that represent varying intensities or severities of common spinal pathologies and injuries and to demonstrate the feasibility of generating automated verbal MRI reports comparable to those produced by reading radiologists.Methods: A 3-dimensional (3D) anatomical model of the lumbar spine was fitted to each of the patient's MRIs by a team of technicians. MRI T1, T2, sagittal, axial, and transverse reconstruction image series were used to train segmentation models by the intersection of the 3D model through these image sequences. Class definitions were extracted from the radiologist report for the central canal: (0) no disc bulge/protrusion/canal stenosis, (1) disc bulge without canal stenosis, (2) disc bulge resulting in canal stenosis, and (3) disc herniation/protrusion/extrusion resulting in canal stenosis. Both the left and right neural foramina were assessed with either (0) neural foraminal stenosis absent, or (1) neural foramina stenosis present. Reporting criteria for the pathologies at each disc level and, when available, the grading of severity were extracted, and a natural language processing model was used to generate a verbal and written report. These data were then used to train a set of very deep convolutional neural network models, optimizing for minimal binary cross-entropy for each classification.Results: The initial prediction validation of the implemented deep learning algorithm was done on 20% of the dataset, which was not used for artificial intelligence training. Of the 17,800 total disc locations for which MRI images and radiology reports were available, 14,720 were used to train the model, and 3560 were used to validate against. The convergence of validation accuracy achieved with the deep learning algorithm for the foraminal stenosis detector was 81% (sensitivity = 72.4.4%, specificity = 83.1%) after 25 complete iterations through the entire training dataset (epoch). The accuracy was 86.2% (sensitivity = 91.1%, specificity = 82.5%) for the central stenosis detector and 85.2% (sensitivity = 81.8%, specificity = 87.4%) for the disc herniation detector.Conclusions: Deep learning algorithms may be used for routine reporting in spine MRI. There was a minimal disparity among accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, indicating that the data were not overfitted to the training set. We concluded that variability in the training data tends to reduce overfitting and overtraining as the deep neural network models learn to focus on the common pathologies. Future studies should demonstrate the accuracy of deep neural network models and the predictive value of favorable clinical outcomes with intervention and surgery.Level of Evidence: 3.Clinical Relevance: Feasibility, clinical teaching, and evaluation study.

TI  - Spectrum Analysis of EEG Signals Using CNN to Model Patient's Consciousness Level Based on Anesthesiologists' Experience
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most challenging predictive data analysis efforts is an accurate prediction of depth of anesthesia (DOA) indicators which has attracted growing attention since it provides patients a safe surgical environment in case of secondary damage caused by intraoperative awareness or brain injury. However, many researchers put heavily handcraft feature extraction or carefully tailored feature engineering to each patient to achieve very high sensitivity and low false prediction rate for a particular dataset. This limits the benefit of the proposed approaches if a different dataset is used. Recently, representations learned using the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for object recognition are becoming a widely used model of the processing hierarchy in the human visual system. The correspondence between models and brain signals that holds the acquired activity at high temporal resolution has been explored less exhaustively. In this paper, deep learning CNN with a range of different architectures is designed for identifying related activities from raw electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, an improved short-time Fourier transform is used to stand for the time-frequency information after extracting the spectral images of the original EEG as input to CNN. Then CNN models are designed and trained to predict the DOA levels from EEG spectrum without handcrafted features, which presents an intuitive mapping process with high efficiency and reliability. As a result, the best trained CNN model achieved an accuracy of 93.50%, interpreted as CNN's deep learning to approximate the DOA by senior anesthesiologists, which highlights the potential of deep CNN combined with advanced visualization techniques for EEG-based brain mapping.

AB  - Capsule endoscopy (CE) is the first-line diagnostic modality for detecting small bowel lesions. CE is non-invasive and does not require sedation, but its movements cannot be controlled, it requires a long time for interpretation, and it has lower image quality compared to wired endoscopy. With the rapid advancement of technology, several methods to solve these problems have been developed. This article describes the ongoing developments regarding external CE locomotion using magnetic force, artificial intelligence-based interpretation, and image-enhancing technologies with the CE system.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Antipsychotic medications are the first-line treatment for schizophrenia. However, non-adherence is frequent despite its negative impact on the course of the illness. In response, we aimed to investigate social media posts about antipsychotics to better understand the online environment in this regard.Methods: We collected tweets containing mentions of antipsychotic medications posted between January 1st 2019 and October 31st 2020. The content of each tweet and the characteristics of the users were analyzed as well as the number of retweets and likes generated.Results: Twitter users, especially those identified as patients, showed an interest in antipsychotic medications, mainly focusing on the topics of sexual dysfunction and sedation. Interestingly, paliperidone, despite being among one of the newest antipsychotics, accounted for a low number of tweets and did not generate much interest. Conversely, retweet and like ratios were higher in those tweets asking for or offering help, in those posted by institutions and in those mentioning cognitive complaints. Moreover, health professionals did not have a strong presence in tweet postings, nor did medical institutions. Finally, trivialization was frequently observed.Conclusion: This analysis of tweets about antipsychotic medications provides insights into experiences and opinions related to this treatment. Twitter user perspectives therefore constitute a valuable input that may help to improve clinicians' knowledge of antipsychotic medications and their communication with patients regarding this treatment.

TI  - An AI-based Multimodal Approach to Predict Pain in Postnatal Care Scenarios
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARYAdvances in technology and surgical procedures in the past decade have led to a remarkableincrease in numbers of newborns subjected to lifesaving surgery. These postoperative neonatesare customarily triaged to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) for pain management withopioids, primarily morphine, fentanyl, and methadone. However, substantial evidence from in-vitro, animal, and human studies strongly suggests this severe pain-to-opioids regimen causeslong-lasting and likely permanent traumatic harm to the developing neurological systems ofneonates.We propose a novel machine learning and computer vision approach for early pain detection(EPD) with emphasis on postoperative neonates in NICU. By alerting NICU caregivers a minimumof ~ 30 minutes prior to pain onset, EPD will allow NICU staff to use fast-acting, opioid-sparingmedications, e.g., intravenous paracetamol, ibuprofen, or ketorolac, in conjunction with non-pharmacological approaches, to “stay ahead of the pain” while avoiding opioid treatments,tolerance, withdrawal, and their associated side effects.Our team of NICU specialists, bioscientists, and computer experts will demonstrate proof-of-concept for reliable EPD in post-surgical neonates using the following aims:1) Collect clinical information and multimodal data (facial expression, body movement, crying frequency, vital signs) for post-surgical pain prediction in neonates.We will collect and label multi-modal signals (facial expression, body movements, cryingfrequency, vital signs) from ~ 60 neonates in post-surgical pain at the NICU at Tampa GeneralHospital (TGH). We will combine these data with similar data from another cohort of ~60 neonates(total ~ 120 neonates) collected using the same system and approach at TGH from 2019 to 2022.2) Show proof-of-concept for predicting the onset of post-surgical pain in neonates.The multimodal data collected from the training cases in Aim 1 will provide the ground truth fortraining a convolutional neural network to predict time-to-onset of pain for postoperative neonatesin the testing cases. The performance target for the EPD in the test cases is pain prediction ~ 30minutes prior to pain onset with a 90% confidence probability. Our intention is to disrupt the currentstandard [surgery; sedation; postoperative pain; opioid dependence, tolerance, withdrawal;discharge] in favor of a safer opioid-sparing approach [surgery; sedation; non-opioid treatment;discharge]. Our Phase 2 studies will add data from more diverse patient populations and examinethe possible effects of EPD on stress biomarkers, e.g., cortisol, norepinephrine in hair, skin, blood,or urine. The major benefit to public health will be protection of perhaps the most vulnerablepatient populations from unnecessary damage to their future health and well-being.

TI  - Improved tracking of sevoflurane anesthetic states with drug-specific machine learning models
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective.The ability to monitor anesthetic states using automated approaches is expected to reduce inaccurate drug dosing and side-effects. Commercially available anesthetic state monitors perform poorly when ketamine is administered as an anesthetic-analgesic adjunct. Poor performance is likely because the models underlying these monitors are not optimized for the electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations that are unique to the co-administration of ketamine.Approach.In this work, we designed twok-nearest neighbors algorithms for anesthetic state prediction.Main results.The first algorithm was trained only on sevoflurane EEG data, making it sevoflurane-specific. This algorithm enabled discrimination of the sevoflurane general anesthesia (GA) state from sedated and awake states (true positive rate = 0.87, [95% CI, 0.76, 0.97]). However, it did not enable discrimination of the sevoflurane-plus-ketamine GA state from sedated and awake states (true positive rate = 0.43, [0.19, 0.67]). In our second algorithm, we implemented a cross drug training paradigm by including both sevoflurane and sevoflurane-plus-ketamine EEG data in our training set. This algorithm enabled discrimination of the sevoflurane-plus-ketamine GA state from sedated and awake states (true positive rate = 0.91, [0.84, 0.98]).Significance.Instead of a one-algorithm-fits-all-drugs approach to anesthetic state monitoring, our results suggest that drug-specific models are necessary to improve the performance of automated anesthetic state monitors.

TI  - A Perioperative Care Display for Understanding High Acuity Patients
T2  - APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The data visualization literature asserts that the details of the optimal data display must be tailored to the specific task, the background of the user, and the characteristics of the data. The general organizing principle of a concept-oriented display is known to be useful for many tasks and data types.Objectives In this project, we used general principles of data visualization and a co-design process to produce a clinical display tailored to a specific cognitive task, chosen from the anesthesia domain, but with clear generalizability to other clinical tasks. To support the work of the anesthesia-in-charge (AIC) our task was, for a given day, to depict the acuity level and complexity of each patient in the collection of those that will be operated on the following day. The AIC uses this information to optimally allocate anesthesia staff and providers across operating rooms.Methods We used a co-design process to collaborate with participants who work in the AIC role. We conducted two in-depth interviews with AICs and engaged them in subsequent input on iterative design solutions.Results Through a co-design process, we found (1) the need to carefully match the level of detail in the display to the level required by the clinical task, (2) the impedance caused by irrelevant information on the screen such as icons relevant only to other tasks, and (3) the desire for a specific but optional trajectory of increasingly detailed textual summaries.Conclusion This study reports a real-world clinical informatics development project that engaged users as co-designers. Our process led to the user-preferred design of a single binary flag to identify the subset of patients needing further investigation, and then a trajectory of increasingly detailed, text-based abstractions for each patient that can be displayed when more information is needed.

AB  - Electronic anesthesia record data have been accumulated, and efforts to solve medical problems using data analysis methods and machine learning have been conducted. Post-induction hypotension frequently occurred after induction of anesthesia. Intraoperative hypotension is associated with various adverse events such as myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction. In a related study, eight machine learning methods were used to construct hypotension prediction models and evaluated by area under the curve (AUC), using data collected from an institution in the United States. Nevertheless, it was not focused on improving prediction power. This paper aims to predict post-induction hypotension with high prediction power using 1,626 electronic anesthesia record data. Our hypotension prediction model using a stacking method is introduced. F-measure 0.60 was achieved by using our method through the evaluation.

TI  - Dynamic prediction of hypoxemia risk at different time points based on preoperative and intraoperative features: machine learning applications in outpatients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Hypoxemia often occurs in outpatients undergoing anesthesia-assisted esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). However, there is a scarcity in tools to predict the hypoxemia risk. We aimed to solve this problem by developing and validating machine learning (ML) models based on preoperative and intraoperative features. Methods All data were retrospectively collected from June 2021 to February 2022. The most appropriate predictive features were selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, which were incorporated and modelled by 4 ML algorithms. The area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) was used as the main evaluation metric to select the best models, and the selected models were compared with the STOP-BANG score. Their predictive performance was visually interpreted by SHapley Additive exPlanations. The primary endpoint of this study was hypoxemia during the procedure, defined as at least one reading of pulse oximetry < 90% without probes misplacement from the anesthesia induction beginning to the end of EGD, while the secondary endpoint was hypoxemia during induction, from the induction beginning to the start of endoscopic intubation. Results Of 1160 patients in the derivation cohort, 112 patients (9.6%) developed intraoperative hypoxemia, of which 102 (8.8%) occurred during the induction period. In temporal and external validation, no matter whether based on preoperative variables or still based on preoperative plus intraoperative variables, our models showed excellent predictive performance for the two endpoints, significantly better than STOP-BANG score. In the model interpretation section, preoperative variables (airway assessment indicators, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation and BMI) and intraoperative variables (the induced propofol dose) made the highest contribution to the predictions. Conclusions To our knowledge, our ML models were the first to predict hypoxemia risk, which achieved excellent overall predictive ability integrating various clinical indicators. These models have the potential to become an effective tool for adjusting sedation strategies flexibly and reducing the workload of anesthesiologists. KEY MESSAGES This study is the first model employing ML methods based on preoperative and preoperative plus intraoperative variables for predicting the risk of hypoxemia during induction and the whole EGD procedure respectively. Our four models achieved satisfactory predictive performance and outperformed STOP-BANG score in terms of AUPRC in the temporal and external validation cohorts respectively. We found that the relevant variables of airway assessment should be fully taken into account when analyzing the risk factor of hypoxemia, and the effect of patients' age on their hypoxemia risk should be considered in conjunction with the propofol dose.

TI  - Epidural anesthesia needle guidance by forward-view endoscopic optical coherence tomography and deep learning
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Epidural anesthesia requires injection of anesthetic into the epidural space in the spine. Accurate placement of the epidural needle is a major challenge. To address this, we developed a forward-view endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) system for real-time imaging of the tissue in front of the needle tip during the puncture. We tested this OCT system in porcine backbones and developed a set of deep learning models to automatically process the imaging data for needle localization. A series of binary classification models were developed to recognize the five layers of the backbone, including fat, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, epidural space, and spinal cord. The classification models provided an average classification accuracy of 96.65%. During puncture, it is important to maintain a safe distance between the needle tip and the dura mater. Regression models were developed to estimate that distance based on the OCT imaging data. Based on the Inception architecture, our models achieved a mean absolute percentage error of 3.05% +/- 0.55%. Overall, our results validated the technical feasibility of using this novel imaging strategy to automatically recognize different tissue structures and measure the distances ahead of the needle tip during the epidural needle placement.

TI  - A Convolutional Neural Network for Real Time Classification, Identification, and Labelling of Vocal Cord and Tracheal Using Laryngoscopy and Bronchoscopy Video
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The use of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, is increasing in medicine. Use of machine learning is rising in the prediction of patient outcomes. Machine learning may also be able to enhance and augment anesthesia clinical procedures such as airway management. In this study, we sought to develop a machine learning algorithm that could classify vocal cords and tracheal airway anatomy real-time during video laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy as well as compare the performance of three novel convolutional networks for detecting vocal cords and tracheal rings. Methods Following institutional approval, a clinical dataset of 775 video laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy videos was used. The dataset was divided into two categories for use for training and testing. We used three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNet, Inception and MobileNet. Backpropagation and a mean squared error loss function were used to assess accuracy as well as minimize bias and variance. Following training, we assessed transferability using the generalization error of the CNN, sensitivity and specificity, average confidence error, outliers, overall confidence percentage, and frames per second for live video feeds. After the training was complete, 22 models using 0 to 25,000 steps were generated and compared. Results The overall confidence of classification for the vocal cords and tracheal rings for ResNet, Inception and MobileNet CNNs were as follows: 0.84, 0.78, and 0.64 for vocal cords, respectively, and 0.69, 0.72, 0.54 for tracheal rings, respectively. Transfer learning following additional training resulted in improved accuracy of ResNet and Inception for identifying the vocal cords (with a confidence of 0.96 and 0.93 respectively). The two best performing CNNs, ResNet and Inception, achieved a specificity of 0.985 and 0.971, respectively, and a sensitivity of 0.865 and 0.892, respectively. Inception was able to process the live video feeds at 10 FPS while ResNet processed at 5 FPS. Both were able to pass a feasibility test of identifying vocal cords and tracheal rings in a video feed. Conclusions We report the development and evaluation of a CNN that can identify and classify airway anatomy in real time. This neural network demonstrates high performance. The availability of artificial intelligence may improve airway management and bronchoscopy by helping to identify key anatomy real time. Thus, potentially improving performance and outcomes during these procedures. Further, this technology may theoretically be extended to the settings of airway pathology or airway management in the hands of experienced providers. The researchers in this study are exploring the performance of this neural network in clinical trials.

CP  - 11th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI)
CL  - Lima, PERU
AB  - Deep learning strategies have become ubiquitous optimization tools for medical image analysis. With the appropriate amount of data, these approaches outperform classic methodologies in a variety of image processing tasks. However, rare diseases and pediatric imaging often lack extensive data. Specially, MRI are uncommon because they require sedation in young children. Moreover, the lack of standardization in MRI protocols introduces a strong variability between different datasets. In this paper, we present a general deep learning architecture for MRI homogenization that also provides the segmentation map of an anatomical region of interest. Homogenization is achieved using an unsupervised architecture based on variational autoencoder with cycle generative adversarial networks, which learns a common space (i.e. a representation of the optimal imaging protocol) using an unpaired image-to-image translation network. The segmentation is simultaneously generated by a supervised learning strategy. We evaluated our method segmenting the challenging anterior visual pathway using three brain T1weighted MRI datasets (variable protocols and vendors). Our method significantly outperformed a non-homogenized multi-protocol U-Net.

TI  - Ascertaining Design Requirements for Postoperative Care Transition Interventions
T2  - APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Handoffs or care transitions from the operating room (OR) to intensive care unit (ICU) are fragmented and vulnerable to communication errors. Although protocols and checklists for standardization help reduce errors, such interventions suffer from limited sustainability. An unexplored aspect is the potential role of developing personalized postoperative transition interventions using artificial intelligence (AI)-generated risks.Objectives This study was aimed to (1) identify factors affecting sustainability of handoff standardization, (2) utilize a human-centered approach to develop design ideas and prototyping requirements for a sustainable handoff intervention, and (3) explore the potential role for AI risk assessment during handoffs.Methods We conducted four design workshops with 24 participants representing OR and ICU teams at a large medical academic center. Data collection phases were (1) open-ended questions, (2) closed card sorting of handoff information elements, and (3) scenario-based design ideation and prototyping for a handoff intervention. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Card sorts were further tallied to characterize handoff information elements as core, flexible, or unnecessary.Results Limited protocol awareness among clinicians and lack of an interdisciplinary electronic health record (EHR)-integrated handoff intervention prevented long-term sustainability of handoff standardization. Clinicians argued for a handoff intervention comprised of core elements (included for all patients) and flexible elements (tailored by patient condition and risks). They also identified unnecessary elements that could be omitted during handoffs. Similarities and differences in handoff intervention requirements among physicians and nurses were noted; in particular, clinicians expressed divergent views on the role of AI-generated postoperative risks.Conclusion Current postoperative handoff interventions focus largely on standardization of information transfer and handoff processes. Our design approach allowed us to visualize accurate models of user expectations for effective interdisciplinary communication. Insights from this study point toward EHR-integrated, "flexibly standardized" care transition interventions that can automatically generate a patient-centered summary and risk-based report.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial comparing water exchange and air insufflation during colonoscopy without sedation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COLORECTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have shown that water exchange is superior to air insufflation in attenuating insertion pain during colonoscopy. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with head-to-head comparison of these methods to assess their effectiveness in colonoscopy without sedation.A total of 447 outpatients were randomized to either water exchange (WE) or the standard air (CO2) insufflation (AI). The primary outcome was the improvement of patient intraprocedural pain (pain score), evaluated using a questionnaire (scores 1 to 5).After exclusion of 44 patients from further analysis, 403 patients were analyzed. There was no difference in clinical background between the WE and AI groups. Patients in the WE group reported less intraprocedural pain than those in the AI group (2.17 +/- 1.06 vs. 2.42 +/- 1.03; unpaired t test, p = 0.021). We divided the cases into two groups, more or less painful colonoscopy, based on age, body mass index, use of anti-peristaltic drugs or not, and physician's experience. In less painful colonoscopy, the WE method could reduce pain effectively but its effect was limited in the more painful group.WE is superior to AI for attenuating insertion pain during colonoscopy without sedation, but its efficacy is limited in more painful endoscopy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - In clinical anesthesia and the rescue of critically ill patients, arterial puncture and catheterization are the most commonly chosen ways to establish central arterial access for patients. Invasive arterial puncture and catheterization facilitate the grasp of real-time vital sign information of patients during surgery, which strengthens patient monitoring during surgery and improves safety. However, the traditional method of arterial puncture and cannulation through palpation of the radial artery is often prone to complications related to mechanical injury, such as hemorrhage, hematoma, and accidental perforation of the artery. Studies have shown that ultrasound-guided radial artery puncture and cannulation can shorten the puncture cannulation time, reduce the incidence of complications related to puncture cannulation, and improve the success rate of puncture cannulation. In order to verify it, this paper uses the experimental group and the control group to conduct comparative experiments and uses the neural network method to evaluate the effects of the two methods. As a more mature method of artificial intelligence, BP neural network is widely used in a wide range of applications and has the characteristics of strong generalization ability and fast convergence, so we choose it as the base model. The specific work of this paper is as follows: (1) in-depth study of the relevant theory of BP neural network (BPNN), focusing on the structure of BPNN and the working principle of algorithm; the problems to be solved in the clinical anesthesia effect evaluation have laid a theoretical foundation for the establishment of an improved BPNN evaluation model in the following chapters. (2) introduce the basic principle of genetic neural network, analyze the benefits of combining genetic neural network and BPNN; introduce in detail the process of genetic algorithm to optimize the weights and thresholds of BPNN, and establish a GA-BP evaluation model. The test proves the feasibility and superiority of the model.

AB  - This study investigates the safety and efficacy of a large-dose, needle-based epidural technique in obstetric anesthesia. The technique differs from a standard, catheter-based approach in that the anesthetic dose is administered through an epidural needle prior to insertion of the epidural catheter. Using a data-driven informatics and machine learning approach, our findings show that the needle-based technique is faster and more dose-effective in achieving sensory level. We also find that injecting large doses in the epidural space through the epidural needle is safe, with complication rates similar to those reported in published literature for catheter-based technique. Further, machine learning reveals that if the needle dose is kept under 18 ml, the resulting hypotension rate will be significantly lower than published results. The machine learning framework can predict the incidence of hypotension with 85% accuracy. The findings from this investigation facilitate delivery improvement and establish an improved clinical practice guideline for training and for dissemination of safe practice.

AB  - Ultrasound-guided anesthesia uses a safe, portable imaging modality to provide visual feedback during the needle injection. Widespread adoption of ultrasound-guided anesthesia has been primarily limited by a lack of access to advanced ultrasound technology and a lack of ultrasound training for anesthesiologists. We sought to address these limitations by introducing a method that aids the interpretability of cross-sectional ultrasound from conventional (2D) machines. We propose a constrained registration of a 3D active shape model constructed from computerized tomography (CT) scans of the lumbar spine to a specific set of targets automatically extracted from 2D B-mode ultrasound images with machine learning models. The registration results in an overlay of the entire bone cross-section of the lumbar spine onto the ultrasound image. Our proposed registration achieved a mean squared error of 1.4 +/- 0.3 mm on a set of 43 ultrasound images, which is smaller than the key anatomical features, suggesting that the overlay is suitable for interpretation.

TI  - Transforming the perioperative medicine care model: The Singapore experience
T2  - ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide annually. Established perioperative centres in the UK, USA and Australia have demonstrated the impact of improving perioperative care in reducing costs, increasing patient satisfaction and improving population health. Likewise, the surgical burden of care in Asia is increasing, but with sociocultural, economic and epigenetic differences compared to the west. As Singapore's largest hospital, the Singapore General Hospital pre-admission perioperative clinic sees about 20,000 patients annually. We aim to illustrate Singapore General Hospital's perioperative model of care to contribute to the paucity of literature describing perioperative programme implementation within Asia, and to encourage the cross-sharing of perioperative practices internationally. Our perioperative framework navigates risk assessment, risk counselling, and mitigation of health, medical and functional risks to better patients' perioperative outcomes and population health. We have implemented evidence-based pathways for common conditions such as anaemia and malnutrition, including a multidisciplinary programme for the elderly to tackle frailty and reduce length of stay. We describe how we have enhanced local risk profiling with the Combined Assessment of Risk Encountered in Surgery surgical risk calculator derived locally using a gradient boosting machine learning model. Finally, we report clinical outcomes of these interventions and discuss further challenges and new initiatives at each tier of our perioperative model. Our perioperative care model provides a framework that other centres can adopt to promote value-driven care, while catering for differences in the Asian population, thereby promoting evidence-based improvements in the area of perioperative medicine.

TI  - Classifying Characteristics of Opioid Use Disorder From Hospital Discharge Summaries Using Natural Language Processing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundOpioid use disorder (OUD) is underdiagnosed in health system settings, limiting research on OUD using electronic health records (EHRs). Medical encounter notes can enrich structured EHR data with documented signs and symptoms of OUD and social risks and behaviors. To capture this information at scale, natural language processing (NLP) tools must be developed and evaluated. We developed and applied an annotation schema to deeply characterize OUD and related clinical, behavioral, and environmental factors, and automated the annotation schema using machine learning and deep learning-based approaches. MethodsUsing the MIMIC-III Critical Care Database, we queried hospital discharge summaries of patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) OUD diagnostic codes. We developed an annotation schema to characterize problematic opioid use, identify individuals with potential OUD, and provide psychosocial context. Two annotators reviewed discharge summaries from 100 patients. We randomly sampled patients with their associated annotated sentences and divided them into training (66 patients; 2,127 annotated sentences) and testing (29 patients; 1,149 annotated sentences) sets. We used the training set to generate features, employing three NLP algorithms/knowledge sources. We trained and tested prediction models for classification with a traditional machine learner (logistic regression) and deep learning approach (Autogluon based on ELECTRA's replaced token detection model). We applied a five-fold cross-validation approach to reduce bias in performance estimates. ResultsThe resulting annotation schema contained 32 classes. We achieved moderate inter-annotator agreement, with F-1-scores across all classes increasing from 48 to 66%. Five classes had a sufficient number of annotations for automation; of these, we observed consistently high performance (F-1-scores) across training and testing sets for drug screening (training: 91-96; testing: 91-94) and opioid type (training: 86-96; testing: 86-99). Performance dropped from training and to testing sets for other drug use (training: 52-65; testing: 40-48), pain management (training: 72-78; testing: 61-78) and psychiatric (training: 73-80; testing: 72). Autogluon achieved the highest performance. ConclusionThis pilot study demonstrated that rich information regarding problematic opioid use can be manually identified by annotators. However, more training samples and features would improve our ability to reliably identify less common classes from clinical text, including text from outpatient settings.

TI  - NIRS measures in pain and analgesia: Fundamentals, features, and function
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Current pain assessment techniques based only on clinical evaluation and self-reports are not objective and may lead to inadequate treatment. Having a functional biomarker will add to the clinical fidelity, diagnosis, and perhaps improve treatment efficacy in patients. While many approaches have been deployed in pain biomarker discovery, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a technology that allows for non-invasive measurement of cortical hemodynamics. The utility of fNIRS is especially attractive given its ability to detect specific changes in the somatosensory and high-order cortices as well as its ability to measure (1) brain function similar to functional magnetic resonance imaging, (2) graded responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli, (3) analgesia, and (4) nociception under anesthesia. In this review, we evaluate the utility of fNIRS in nociception/pain with particular focus on its sensitivity and specificity, methodological advantages and limitations, and the current and potential applications in various pain conditions. Everything considered, fNIRS technology could enhance our ability to evaluate evoked and persistent pain across different age groups and clinical populations.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of consciousness during anesthesia without EEG data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is a daily challenge for anesthesiologists. The best assessment of the depth of anesthesia is commonly thought to be the one made by the doctor in charge of the patient. This evaluation is based on the integration of several parameters including epidemiological, pharmacological and physiological data. By developing a protocol to record synchronously all these parameters we aim at having this evaluation made by an algorithm. Our hypothesis was that the standard parameters recorded during anesthesia (without EEG) could provide a good insight into the consciousness level of the patient. We developed a complete solution for high-resolution longitudinal follow-up of patients during anesthesia. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was trained on the database in order to predict and assess states based on four physiological variables that were adjusted to the consciousness level: Heart Rate (HR), Mean Blood Pressure (MeanBP) Respiratory Rate (RR), and AA Inspiratory Concentration (AAFi) all without using EEG recordings. Patients undergoing general anesthesia for hernial inguinal repair were included after informed consent. The algorithm was tested on 30 patients. The percentage of error to identify the actual state among Awake, LOC, Anesthesia, ROC and Emergence was 18%. This protocol constitutes the very first step on the way towards a multimodal approach of anesthesia. The fact that our first classifier already demonstrated a good predictability is very encouraging for the future. Indeed, this first model was merely a proof of concept to encourage research ways in the field of machine learning and anesthesia.

TI  - Multiscale depth of anaesthesia prediction for surgery using frontal cortex electroencephalography
T2  - HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypnotic and sedative anaesthetic agents are employed during multiple medical interventions to prevent patient awareness. Careful titration of agent dosing is required to avoid negative side effects; the accuracy thereof may be improved by Depth of Anaesthesia Monitoring. This work investigates the potential of a patient specific depth monitoring prediction using electroencephalography recorded neural oscillation from the frontal lobe of 10 patients during sedation, where a comparison of the prediction accuracy was made across five different approaches to post-processing; Noise Assisted-Empirical Mode Decomposition, the Raw Signal, Linear Series Decomposition Learner, Deep Wavelet Scattering and Deep Learning features. These methods towards anaesthesia depth prediction were investigated using the Bispectral Index as ground truth, where it was seen that the Raw Signal, enhanced feature set and a low complexity classification model (Linear Discriminant Analysis) provided the best classification accuracy, in the region of 85.65 % +/- 10.23 % across the 10 subjects. Subsequent work in this area would now build on these results and validate the best performing methods on a wider cohort of patients, investigate means of continuous DoA estimation using regressions, and also feature optimisation exercises in order to further streamline and reduce the computation complexity of the designed model.

T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Proper maintenance of hypnosis is crucial for ensuring the safety of patients undergoing surgery. Accordingly, indicators, such as the Bispectral index (BIS), have been developed to monitor hypnotic levels. However, the black-box nature of the algorithm coupled with the hardware makes it challenging to understand the underlying mechanisms of the algorithms and integrate them with other monitoring systems, thereby limiting their use.Objective: We propose an interpretable deep learning model that forecasts BIS values 25 s in advance using 30 s electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Material and methods: The proposed model utilized EEG data as a predictor, which is then decomposed into amplitude and phase components using fast Fourier Transform. An attention mechanism was applied to interpret the importance of these components in predicting BIS. The predictability of the model was evaluated on both regression and binary classification tasks, where the former involved predicting a continuous BIS value, and the latter involved classifying a dichotomous status at a BIS value of 60. To evaluate the interpretability of the model, we analyzed the attention values expressed in the amplitude and phase components according to five ranges of BIS values. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using datasets collected from two separate medical institutions.Results and conclusion: The proposed model achieved excellent performance on both the internal and external validation datasets. The model achieved a root-mean-square error of 6.614 for the regression task, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.937 for the binary classification task. Interpretability analysis provided insight into the relationship between EEG frequency components and BIS values. Specifically, the attention mechanism revealed that higher BIS values were associated with increased amplitude attention values in high-frequency bands and increased phase attention values in various frequency bands. This finding is expected to facilitate a more profound understanding of the BIS prediction mechanism, thereby contributing to the advancement of anesthesia technologies.

TI  - Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - AbstractSeventy percent of American adults are overweight or obese, presenting an unprecedented challenge to thenation’s health systems. Effective behavioral programs exist, but these programs are intensive, long-term andrequire highly-trained clinicians, making them prohibitively expensive and thus limiting disseminability.Approaches to decreasing costs include replacing highly-trained clinicians with paraprofessionals, reducingcontact frequency, and/or automating intervention. However, although these alternative interventions result inconsiderably lower average weight losses, variability of weight loss is high. Specifically, and consistent with aSupportive Accountability Model, a substantial minority of participants in high-intensity interventions receive nobenefit, while a subset of those receiving low-intensity interventions achieve clinically significant weight loss.An ideal weight loss treatment system would enhance outcomes and reduce costs by matching eachparticipant to the intervention he/she needs, thus adapting to participants’ needs and conserving resourceswhere they are not needed. Stepped care represents one such system, but has had mixed success and suffersfrom a number of shortcomings. The innovative artificial intelligence (AI) strategy of reinforcement learning(RL) provides rapidly and repeatedly-varying features of intervention, continuously "learning" which featuresprovide optimal responses for which participants. Our team recently completed a pilot of an AI weight losssystem in which overweight adults received a brief in-person weight loss intervention and then were randomlyassigned to receive 3 months of non-optimized interventions (i.e., 12-minute phone calls) or an optimizedcombination of phone calls, text exchanges, and automated messages, selected based on each participants’response to each intervention as determined by weight and behavioral data. As hypothesized, we achievedequivalent weight losses at a fraction of the time cost. The proposed study would recruit 320 overweight adults,provide 1 month of group-based behavioral weight loss treatment and then randomize participants to eithercontinue to receive group-based behavioral weight loss in a remote format for 11 months (BWL-S) or toreinforcement learning-based treatment (BWL-AI). In line with our Supportive Accountability model, BWL-AIwould vary modality, intensity and counselor skill based on continuously-monitored participant digital data. Theproposed study--the first of its kind--would expand on our pilot in several ways including sample size, duration,and features of intervention selected by the AI system. Aims of this project are to test the hypotheses thatweight loss outcomes in BWL-AI will be equivalent to or better than BWL-S, and that the cost per participantand per kg of lost weight will be less in BWL-AI than in BWL-S. Other include characterizing the AI system (interms of interventions selected), assessing feasibility and acceptability of the refined AI system, evaluatingpsychological and demographic predictors of AI intervention selection and investigating differences betweenresponders and non-responders in how the AI system allocates resources.

T2  - REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) involves the acquisition and interpretation of ultrasound images to delineate sonoanatomy. This study explores the utility of a novel artificial intelligence (Al) device designed to assist in this task (ScanNav Anatomy Peripheral Nerve Block; ScanNav), which applies a color overlay on real-time ultrasound to highlight key anatomical structures.Methods Thirty anesthesiologists, 15 non-experts and 15 experts in UGRA, performed 240 ultrasound scans across nine peripheral nerve block regions. Half were performed with ScanNay. After scanning each block region, participants completed a questionnaire on the utility of the device in relation to training, teaching, and clinical practice in ultrasound scanning for UGRA. Ultrasound and color overlay output were recorded from scans performed with ScanNay. Experts present during the scans (real-time experts) were asked to assess potential for increased risk associated with use of the device (eg, needle trauma to safety structures). This was compared with experts who viewed the Al scans remotely.Results Non-experts were more likely to provide positive and less likely to provide negative feedback than experts (p=0.001). Positive feedback was provided most frequently by non-experts on the potential role for training (37/60, 61.7%); for experts, it was for its utility in teaching (30/60, 50%). Real-time and remote experts reported a potentially increased risk in 12/254 (4.7%) vs 8/254 (3.1%, p=0.362) scans, respectively.Discussion ScanNav shows potential to support non-experts in training and clinical practice, and experts in teaching UGRA. Such technology may aid the uptake and generalizability of UGRA.

AB  - ABSTRACTScience: One in five patients who develop a postoperative pulmonary complication (PPC) dies within 30 daysof surgery. PPCs are the second most frequent surgical complications and lead to increased admission tointensive care units, longer hospital length of stay, and high resource utilization. Ventilator induced lung injury(VILI) secondary to intraoperative mechanical ventilation is a risk for PPCs. Lung protective ventilation, whichentails lower tidal volume, sufficient positive end expiratory pressure, optimal inspiratory time and an alveolarrecruitment maneuver, has been adopted for intraoperative use to protect pulmonary parenchyma against VILIand ultimately reduce PPC incidence. However, we still do not know the optimal ventilator parameters to yieldthe lowest incidence of PPCs, because what is best varies from patient to patient. Personalized ventilatorparameters are a potential solution to solve this problem. A retrospective study leveraging electronic healthrecords (EHRs) is proposed to identify PPC risks by phenotyping adult surgical patients who underwentgeneral anesthesia with mechanical ventilation. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Examine theincidence of PPCs in the overall study population and phenotype patients based on nonmodifiable patient,surgical, and anesthesia characteristics; and examine the incidence of PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup;(2) Determine the optimal modifiable intraoperative ventilatory parameters associated with the lowest severityof PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup; and (3) Explore machine learning algorithms for predictive modelsof the incidence of PPCs on patient, surgical, and anesthesia characteristics as well as intraoperative ventilatorparameters. The goal of this aim is to gain knowledge and training in machine learning to lay a foundation forpostdoctoral training.Training: My long-term training goal is to become a leading nurse scientist in precision health using datascience to improve patient outcomes following surgery, such as reducing PPCs. To achieve this goal, I havethree short-term goals during my fellowship training: (1) gain knowledge and skills in research design toenhance precision health in anesthesiology to, (2) gain knowledge in advanced analytic techniques forconducting research using big data, and (3) gain an advanced understanding of pulmonary physiology andpathophysiology that influence anesthesia and patient surgical outcomes. This fellowship will allow meprotected time to reach my training goals and to build a foundation for my long-term career goals. During thenext twenty-six months as a trainee, I will obtain additional training in (1) research methods and design, (2)advanced statistical methods, (3) precision health, and (4) advanced pulmonary physiology andpathophysiology.

TI  - Enhancing captive Indian rhinoceros genetics <i>via</i> artificial insemination of cryopreserved sperm
T2  - ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to design an artificial insemination (AI) protocol using cryopreserved spermatozoa to obtain pregnancies in captive Indian rhinoceroses (Rhinoceros unicornis). Four methods developed varied by timing and approach, as follows; Method 1: females (n = 2) were inseminated pre- and post-ovulation under general anesthesia, Method 2: females (n=2) were inseminated pre-ovulation without anesthetic via endoscopy, Method 3: females (n=1) were inseminated pre-ovulation without anesthetic via manual insertion of an insemination catheter, Method 4: females (n = 2) were inseminated same as Method 3 with the addition of standing sedation. Semen deposition site varied as a result of changes in AI technology and experience. All females conceived following intrauterine AI using three methods. Four pregnancies (n=3 females) produced via Method 3 and 4 resulted in term births (n = 2 male calves, n = 2 female calves) at 481.8 +/- 12.8 days post-AI. Unfortunately, two early pregnancy losses were documented in a fourth female conceiving via Method 2. Pregnancy rates were 0%, 22%, 17%, and 50% for Method 1-4, respectively. Method 3 and 4 rates improved to 29% and 67%, respectively when accounting for AI's conducted only on ovulatory estrous cycles. Spermatozoa (n=5 males) were cryopreserved 0.3-9.3 y prior to successful AI procedures. The lowest dose of frozen-thawed sperm resulting in conception was 500 x 10(6) motile sperm. Mean time from AI to ovulation in conceptive and non-conceptive cycles was 26 +/- 11.8 h and 66 +/- 80.7 h, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Machine Learning in Pain Medicine: An Up-To-Date Systematic Review
T2  - PAIN AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Pain is the unpleasant sensation and emotional experience that leads to poor quality of life for millions of people worldwide. Considering the complexity in understanding the principles of pain and its significant impact on individuals and society, research focuses to deliver innovative pain relief methods and techniques. This review explores the clinical uses of machine learning (ML) for the diagnosis, classification, and management of pain. Methods A systematic review of the current literature was conducted using the PubMed database library. Results Twenty-six papers related to pain and ML research were included. Most of the studies used ML for effectively classifying the patients' level of pain, followed by use of ML for the prediction of manifestation of pain and for pain management. A less common reason for performing ML analysis was for the diagnosis of pain. The different approaches are thoroughly discussed. Conclusion ML is increasingly used in pain medicine and appears to be more effective compared to traditional statistical approaches in the diagnosis, classification, and management of pain.

TI  - Effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol on patient-ventilator interaction in difficult-to-wean, mechanically ventilated patients: a prospective, open-label, randomised, multicentre study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Dexmedetomidine can be used for sedation of mechanically ventilated patients and has minor respiratory effects. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of patient-ventilator dyssynchronies during sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol.Methods: We conducted a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised clinical trial, comparing dexmedetomidine with standard propofol sedation at three intensive care units of university hospitals in Italy. Twenty difficult-to-wean patients for whom the first weaning trial had failed and who were on pressure support ventilation were randomised to receive sedation with either dexmedetomidine or propofol at a similar level of sedation (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale [RASS] score + 1 to -2). The asynchrony index (AI) was calculated using tracings of airflow, airway pressure and electrical activity of the diaphragm sampled at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h.Results: The mean AI was lower with dexmedetomidine than with propofol from 2 h onwards, although the two groups significantly differed only at 12 h (2.68 % vs 9.10 %, p < 0.05). No further difference was observed at 18 and 24 h.Conclusions: When sedation with propofol and dexmedetomidine was compared at similar RASS scores of patients in whom first weaning trial had failed, the AI was lower with dexmedetomidine than with propofol, and this difference was statistically significant at 12 h. These results suggest that sedation with dexmedetomidine may offer some advantages in terms of patient-ventilator synchrony.

TI  - The Impact of Emerging Technologies on Residency Selection by Medical Students in 2017 and 2021, With a Focus on Diagnostic Radiology
T2  - ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: We sought to determine the perceived impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies (ET) on various specialties by medical students in both 2017 and 2021 and how this might affect their residency selections.Materials and Methods: We conducted a brief, anonymous survey of all medical students at a single institution in 2017 and 2021. Survey questions evaluated (1) incentives motivating residency selection and career path, (2) degree of interest in each specialty, (3) perceived effect that ET will have on job prospects for each specialty, and (4) those specialties that students would not consider because of con-cerns regarding ET.Results: A total of 72% (384/532) and 54% (321/598) of medical students participated in the survey in 2017 and 2021, respectively, and results were largely stable. Students perceived ET would reduce job prospects for pathology, diagnostic radiology, and anesthesiology, and enhance prospects for all other specialties (p < 0.01) except dermatology. For both surveys, 23% of students would NOT consider diagnostic radiology because ET would make it obsolete, higher than all other specialties (p < 0.01). Regarding the one student class that was surveyed twice, 50% felt ET would reduce job prospects for radiology in 2017, increasing to 71% in 2021 (p < 0.01), and similar per-centages-20% in 2017 and 23% in 2021-said they explicitly would not consider radiology because of concerns levied by ET.Conclusions: Current perceptions of ET likely affect residency selection for a large proportion of medical students and may impact the future of various specialties, particularly diagnostic radiology.

TI  - A Deep Learning Framework for Anesthesia Depth Prediction from Drug Infusion History
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol and remifentanil intravenous anesthesia, accurate prediction of the depth of anesthesia (DOA) is very challenging. Patients with different physiological characteristics have inconsistent pharmacodynamic responses during different stages of anesthesia. For example, in TCI, older adults transition smoothly from the induction period to the maintenance period, while younger adults are more prone to anesthetic awareness, resulting in different DOA data distributions among patients. To address these problems, a deep learning framework that incorporates domain adaptation and knowledge distillation and uses propofol and remifentanil doses at historical moments to continuously predict the bispectral index (BIS) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a modified adaptive recurrent neural network (AdaRNN) is adopted to address data distribution differences among patients. Moreover, a knowledge distillation pipeline is developed to train the prediction network by enabling it to learn intermediate feature representations of the teacher network. The experimental results show that our method exhibits better performance than existing approaches during all anesthetic phases in the TCI of propofol and remifentanil intravenous anesthesia. In particular, our method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of root mean square error and mean absolute error by 1 and 0.8, respectively, in the internal dataset as well as in the publicly available dataset.

TI  - Machine Learning Technology for EEG-Forecast of the Blood-Brain Barrier Leakage and the Activation of the Brain's Drainage System during Isoflurane Anesthesia
T2  - BIOMOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Anesthesia enables the painless performance of complex surgical procedures. However, the effects of anesthesia on the brain may not be limited only by its duration. Also, anesthetic agents may cause long-lasting changes in the brain. There is growing evidence that anesthesia can disrupt the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. However, there are no widely used methods for real-time BBB monitoring during surgery. The development of technologies for an express diagnosis of the opening of the BBB (OBBB) is a challenge for reducing post-surgical/anesthesia consequences. In this study on male rats, we demonstrate a successful application of machine learning technology, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), to recognize the OBBB induced by isoflurane, which is widely used in surgery. The ANNs were trained on our previously presented data obtained on the sound-induced OBBB with an 85% testing accuracy. Using an optical and nonlinear analysis of the OBBB, we found that 1% isoflurane does not induce any changes in the BBB, while 4% isoflurane caused significant BBB leakage in all tested rats. Both 1% and 4% isoflurane stimulate the brain's drainage system (BDS) in a dose-related manner. We show that ANNs can recognize the OBBB induced by 4% isoflurane in 57% of rats and BDS activation induced by 1% isoflurane in 81% of rats. These results open new perspectives for the development of clinically significant bedside technologies for EEG-monitoring of OBBB and BDS.

TI  - The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning monitoring to safely administer a fluid-restrictive goal-directed treatment protocol to minimize the risk of transfusion during major spine surgery of a Jehovah's Witness: a case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) displays an innovative monitoring tool which predicts intraoperative hypotension before its onset. Case presentation We report the case of an 84-year-old Caucasian woman undergoing major spinal surgery with no possibility for the transfer of blood products given her status as a Jehovah's Witness. The hemodynamic treatment algorithm we employed was based on HPI and resulted in a high degree of hemodynamic stability during the surgical procedure. Further, the patient was not at risk for either hypo- or hypervolemia, conditions which might have caused dilution anemia. By using HPI as a tool for patient blood management, it was possible to reduce the incidence of intraoperative hypotension to a minimum. Conclusions In sum, this HPI-based treatment algorithm represents a useful application for the treatment of complex anesthesia and perioperative patient blood management. It is a simple but powerful extension of standard monitoring for the prevention of intraoperative hypotension.

TI  - Artificial neural networks can be effectively used to model changes of intracranial pressure (ICP) during spinal surgery different noninvasive ICP estimators
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques play a major role in anesthesiology, even though their importance is often overlooked. In the extant literature, AI approaches, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been underutilized, being used mainly to model patient's consciousness state, to predict the precise number of anesthetic gases, the level of analgesia, or the need of anesthesiological blocks, among oth-ers. In the field of neurosurgery, ANNs have been effectively applied to the diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral tumors, seizures, low back pain, and also to the monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP).METHODS: A multilayer perceptron (MLP), which is a feedforward ANN, with hyperbolic tangent as activation function in the input/hidden layers, softmax as activation function in the output layer, and cross-entropy as error function, was used to model the impact of prone versus supine position and the use of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) on ICP in a sample of 30 patients undergoing spinal surgery. Different noninvasive surrogate estimations of ICP have been used and compared: namely, mean optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), noninvasive esti-mated cerebral perfusion pressure (NCPP), Pulsatility Index (PI), ICP derived from PI (ICP-PI), and flow velocity diastolic formula (FVDICP).RESULTS: ONSD proved to be a more robust surrogate estimation of ICP, with a predictive power of 75%, whilst the power of NCPP, ICP-PI, PI, and FVDICP were 60.5%, 54.8%, 53.1%, and 47.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our MLP analysis confirmed our findings previously obtained with regression, correlation, multivariate receiving operator curve (multi-ROC) analyses. ANNs can be successfully used to predict the effects of prone versus supine position and PEEP on ICP in patients undergoing spinal surgery using different noninvasive surrogate estimators of ICP.

AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The method involves obtaining ultrasound                images of a portion of the patient's thorax. The                ultrasound images are processed to obtain health                information using a machine-learning algorithm. The                health information is responsive to changes in                health of the patient. The sedation information of                the patient is obtained. The sedation information                provides details on a dosage of sedative provided                to the patient. The ventilation information of the                patient is obtained. The ventilation information                provides details on settings of a ventilator (195)                providing ventilation to the patient. The obtained                health information, the sedation information and                the ventilation information are displayed at a same                user interface (120).
                    USE - Computer-implemented method of providing                information for assisting in treatment of                ventilated and sedated patient using information                provision system provided for ultrasound imaging                system (claimed).
                    ADVANTAGE - The method provides a user interface that                provides a user with information for managing                ventilation and sedation of a patient within a                clinical setting, thus aiding to reduce                post-ventilation (e.g. post-extubation)                complications. The proposed display providing                information on various characteristics of the                subject thus helps users to have a broader vision                of health status of the patient. The user of the                user interface is enabled to observe deterioration                of the patient and changes in their status to                improve a clinical decision making process. The                stability of the patient is maintained to improve                the patient's health over time. The health,                sedation and ventilation information is displayed                in a pie chart form so that a user easily compares                a variance of each of these pieces of information                thus readily detecting which information has the                greatest variance.

TI  - A Real-Time Depth of Anesthesia Monitoring System Based on Deep Neural Network With Large EDO Tolerant EEG Analog Front-End

AB  - In this article, we present a real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) based depth of anesthesia (DoA) monitoring system in conjunction with a deep learning framework, AnesNET. An EEG analog front-end (AFE) that can compensate +/- 380-mV electrode DC offset using a coarse digital DC servo loop is implemented in the proposed system. The EEG-based MAC, EEGMAC, is introduced as a novel index to accurately predict the DoA, which is designed for applying to patients anesthetized by both volatile and intravenous agents. The proposed deep learning protocol consists of four layers of convolutional neural network and two dense layers. In addition, we optimize the complexity of the deep neural network (DNN) to operate on a microcomputer such as the Raspberry Pi 3, realizing a cost-effective small-size DoA monitoring system. Fabricated in 110-nm CMOS, the prototype AFE consumes 4.33 mu W per channel and has the input-referred noise of 0.29 mu Vrms from 0.5 to 100 Hz with the noise efficiency factor of 2.2. The proposed DNN was evaluated with pre-recorded EEG data from 374 subjects administrated by inhalational anesthetics under surgery, achieving an average squared and absolute errors of 0.048 and 0.05, respectively. The EEGMAC with subjects anesthetized by an intravenous agent also showed a good agreement with the bispectral index value, confirming the proposed DoA index is applicable to both anesthetics. The implemented monitoring system with the Raspberry Pi 3 estimates the EEGMAC within 20 ms, which is about thousand-fold faster than the BIS estimation in literature.

TI  - Imaging Features of Artificial Intelligence Algorithm in the Analysis of Cerebral Protective Effect of Craniotomy Hematoma Removal under Propofol Anesthesia in Patients with Chronic Subdural Hematoma
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The aim of this work was to study the cerebral protective effect of craniotomy hematoma removal under propofol anesthesia based on the artificial intelligence algorithm analysis of the changes in imaging characteristics of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) patients. Methods. A total of 60 CSDH patients who were treated in hospital were recruited and were randomly rolled into an experimental group and a control group, with 30 people in each group. Patients in the experimental group were treated with propofol anesthesia + craniotomy hematoma removal, while those in the control group were treated with conventional anesthesia + craniotomy hematoma removal. Head CT examinations were performed on the next day, one week, one month, three months, and six months after the operation. A two-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) algorithm was used for edge detection and denoising of brain CT images of CSDH patients. Then, the amount of hematoma was calculated, and the Markwalder grading was performed to evaluate the neurological function. The number of recurrence and reoperation cases within six months of follow-up was collected. Results. 1. The quality of CT images was remarkably improved after processing with artificial intelligence algorithms. 2. The amount of hematoma in the experimental group was remarkably lower than that in the control group at January, March, and June after surgery (12.89 +/- 2.12 VS 20.32 +/- 16.41; 7.55 +/- 4.13 VS 15.88 +/- 14.22; 3.39 +/- 3.79 VS 6.55 +/- 3.69, P < 0.05). 3. The experimental group was remarkably better than the control group in Markwalder grading three months and six months after the operation (P < 0.05). Conclusion. Artificial intelligence algorithm had good effect on the brain CT image processing of CSDH patients, and craniotomy hematoma removal under propofol anesthesia had an ideal brain protection effect.

TI  - Development of a Machine-Learning Model for Prediction of Extubation Failure in Patients with Difficult Airways after General Anesthesia of Head, Neck, and Maxillofacial Surgeries
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: Extubation failure after general anesthesia is significantly associated with morbidity and mortality. The risk of a difficult airway after the general anesthesia of head, neck, and maxillofacial surgeries is significantly higher than that after general surgery, increasing the incidence of extubation failure. This study aimed to develop a multivariable prediction model based on a supervised machine-learning algorithm to predict extubation failure in adult patients after head, neck, and maxillofacial surgeries. (2) Methods: A single-center retrospective study was conducted in adult patients who underwent head, neck, and maxillofacial general anesthesia between July 2015 and July 2022 at the Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital. The primary outcome was extubation failure after general anesthesia. The dataset was divided into training (70%) and final test sets (30%). A five-fold cross-validation was conducted in the training set to reduce bias caused by the randomly divided dataset. Clinical data related to extubation failure were collected and a stepwise logistic regression was performed to screen out the key features. Six machine-learning methods were introduced for modeling, including random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LOG), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and optical gradient boosting machine (GBM). The best performance model in the first cross-validation dataset was further optimized and the final performance was assessed using the final test set. (3) Results: In total, 89,279 patients over seven years were reviewed. Extubation failure occurred in 77 patients. Next, 186 patients with a successful extubation were screened as the control group according to the surgery type for patients with extubation failure. Based on the stepwise regression, seven variables were screened for subsequent analysis. After training, SVM and LOG models showed better prediction ability. In the k-fold dataset, the area under the curve using SVM and LOG were 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.93) and 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.82), respectively, in the k-fold dataset. (4) Conclusion: Applying our machine-learning model to predict extubation failure after general anesthesia in clinical practice might help to reduce morbidity and mortality of patients with difficult airways after head, neck, and maxillofacial surgeries.

TI  - Hypotension Prediction Index Software to Prevent Intraoperative Hypotension during Major Non-Cardiac Surgery: Protocol for a European Multicenter Prospective Observational Registry (EU-HYPROTECT)
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Intraoperative hypotension is common in patients having non-cardiac surgery and associated with postoperative acute myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, and mortality. Avoiding intraoperative hypotension is a complex task for anesthesiologists. Using artificial intelligence to predict hypotension from clinical and hemodynamic data is an innovative and intriguing approach. The Acumen (TM) Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) software (Edwards Lifesciences; Irvine, CA, USA) was developed using artificial intelligence-specifically machine learning-and predicts hypotension from blood pressure waveform features. We aimed to describe the incidence, duration, severity, and causes of intraoperative hypotension when using HPI monitoring in patients having elective major non-cardiac surgery Methods: We built up a European, multicenter, prospective, observational registry including at least 700 evaluable patients from five European countries. The registry includes consenting adults (>= 18 years) who were scheduled for elective major non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia that was expected to last at least 120 min and in whom arterial catheter placement and HPI monitoring was planned. The major objectives are to quantify and characterize intraoperative hypotension (defined as a mean arterial pressure [MAP] < 65 mmHg) when using HPI monitoring. This includes the time-weighted average (TWA) MAP < 65 mmHg, area under a MAP of 65 mmHg, the number of episodes of a MAP < 65 mmHg, the proportion of patients with at least one episode (1 min or more) of a MAP < 65 mmHg, and the absolute maximum decrease below a MAP of 65 mmHg. In addition, we will assess causes of intraoperative hypotension and investigate associations between intraoperative hypotension and postoperative outcomes. Discussion: There are only sparse data on the effect of using HPI monitoring on intraoperative hypotension in patients having elective major non-cardiac surgery. Therefore, we built up a European, multicenter, prospective, observational registry to describe the incidence, duration, severity, and causes of intraoperative hypotension when using HPI monitoring in patients having elective major non-cardiac surgery.

TI  - Trends in anesthesiology research: a machine learning approach to theme discovery and summarization.
T2  - JAMIA open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Traditionally, summarization of research themes and trends within a given discipline was accomplished by manual review of scientific works in the field. However, with the ushering in of the age of "big data," new methods for discovery of such information become necessary as traditional techniques become increasingly difficult to apply due to the exponential growth of document repositories. Our objectives are to develop a pipeline for unsupervised theme extraction and summarization of thematic trends in document repositories, and to test it by applying it to a specific domain.METHODS: To that end, we detail a pipeline, which utilizes machine learning and natural language processing for unsupervised theme extraction, and a novel method for summarization of thematic trends, and network mapping for visualization of thematic relations. We then apply this pipeline to a collection of anesthesiology abstracts.RESULTS: We demonstrate how this pipeline enables discovery of major themes and temporal trends in anesthesiology research and facilitates document classification and corpus exploration.DISCUSSION: The relation of prevalent topics and extracted trends to recent events in both anesthesiology, and healthcare in general, demonstrates the pipeline's utility. Furthermore, the agreement between the unsupervised thematic grouping and human-assigned classification validates the pipeline's accuracy and demonstrates another potential use.CONCLUSION: The described pipeline enables summarization and exploration of large document repositories, facilitates classification, aids in trend identification. A more robust and user-friendly interface will facilitate the expansion of this methodology to other domains. This will be the focus of future work for our group.

TI  - The Lifelong Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Clinical Prediction Models on Patients With Tetralogy of Fallot.
T2  - CJC pediatric and congenital heart disease
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Medical advancements in the diagnosis, surgical techniques, perioperative care, and continued care throughout childhood have transformed the outlook for individuals with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), improving survival and shifting the perspective towards lifelong care. However, with a growing population of survivors, longstanding challenges have been accentuated, and new challenges have surfaced, necessitating a re-evaluation of TOF care. Availability of prenatal diagnostics, insufficient information from traditional imaging techniques, previously unforeseen medical complications, and debates surrounding optimal timing and indications for reintervention are among the emerging issues. To address these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning holds great promise as they have the potential to revolutionize patient management and positively impact lifelong outcomes for individuals with TOF. Innovative applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have spanned across multiple domains of TOF care, including screening and diagnosis, automated image processing and interpretation, clinical risk stratification, and planning and performing cardiac interventions. By embracing these advancements and incorporating them into routine clinical practice, personalized medicine could be delivered, leading to the best possible outcomes for patients. In this review, we provide an overview of these evolving applications and emphasize the challenges, limitations, and future potential for integrating them into clinical care.
AB  - De grandes avancees medicales touchant le diagnostic de la tetralogie de Fallot (TF), les techniques chirurgicales, les soins perioperatoires ainsi que les soins continus au cours de lenfance ont transforme le pronostic de cette maladie et prolonge la survie des patients, doo la necessite dadopter une approche therapeutique a long terme. Compte tenu du nombre croissant de survivants, certains defis prennent une plus grande ampleur et de nouvelles difficultes sy ajoutent. Il convient donc de reevaluer les soins pour les patients atteints de TF. Lacces limite au diagnostic prenatal, les informations fragmentaires obtenues avec les techniques dimagerie traditionnelles, les complications medicales inattendues et les debats sur les indications et le moment approprie pour les interventions chirurgicales subsequentes sont de nouveaux enjeux. Pour y faire face, lintegration des outils dintelligence artificielle (IA) et dapprentissage automatique (AA) est prometteuse et pourrait reinventer la prise en charge des patients atteints de TF en plus dameliorer leurs resultats a long terme. Lutilisation innovante de lIA et de lAA touche de nombreux aspects des soins offerts a ces patients, par exemple le depistage et le diagnostic, lanalyse et linterpretation automatiques dimages, la stratification du risque clinique de meme que la planification et la realisation dinterventions cardiaques. Ladoption de ces avancees technologiques et leur integration dans la pratique clinique courante ouvrent la voie a une approche de medecine personnalisee dans lespoir dobtenir les meilleurs resultats possibles pour les patients. Notre article de synthese presente ces applications en pleine evolution et met en evidence leurs perspectives dintegration aux soins cliniques, mais aussi les defis et les limites qui accompagnent cette approche.

T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDHypotension after the induction of anesthesia is known to be associated with various adverse events. The involvement of a series of factors makes the prediction of hypotension during anesthesia quite challenging.AIMTo explore the ability and effectiveness of a random forest (RF) model in the prediction of post-induction hypotension (PIH) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.METHODSPatient information was obtained from the electronic health records of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University. The study included patients, >= 18 years of age, who underwent cardiac surgery from December 2007 to January 2018. An RF algorithm, which is a supervised machine learning technique, was employed to predict PIH. Model performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic. Mean decrease in the Gini index was used to rank various features based on their importance.RESULTSOf the 3030 patients included in the study, 1578 (52.1%) experienced hypotension after the induction of anesthesia. The RF model performed effectively, with an AUC of 0.843 (0.808-0.877) and identified mean blood pressure as the most important predictor of PIH after anesthesia. Age and body mass index also had a significant impact.CONCLUSIONThe generated RF model had high discrimination ability for the identification of individuals at high risk for a hypotensive event during cardiac surgery. The study results highlighted that machine learning tools confer unique advantages for the prediction of adverse post-anesthesia events.

TI  - Pain Management Mobile Applications: A Systematic Review of Commercial and Research Efforts
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Shared decision making is crucial in the pain domain. The subjective nature of pain demands solutions that can facilitate pain assessment and management. The aim of the current study is to review the current trends in both the commercial and the research domains in order to reveal the key issues and guidelines that could further help in the effective development of pain-focused apps. We searched for scientific publications and commercial apps in 22 databases and the two major app stores. Out of 3612 articles and 336 apps, 69 met the requirements for inclusion following the PRISMA guidelines. An analysis of their features (technological approach, design methodology, evaluation strategy, and others) identified critical points that have to be taken into consideration in future efforts. For example, commercial and research efforts target different types of pain, while no participatory design is followed in the majority of the cases examined. Moreover, the evaluation of the final apps remains a challenge that hinders their success. The examined domain is expected to experience a substantial increase. More research is needed towards the development of non-intrusive wearables and sensors for pain detection and assessment, along with artificial intelligence techniques and open data.

TI  - Machine Learning and Intelligent Diagnostics in Dental and Orofacial Pain Management: A Systematic Review
T2  - PAIN RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose. The study explored the clinical influence, effectiveness, limitations, and human comparison outcomes of machine learning in diagnosing (1) dental diseases, (2) periodontal diseases, (3) trauma and neuralgias, (4) cysts and tumors, (5) glandular disorders, and (6) bone and temporomandibular joint as possible causes of dental and orofacial pain. Method. Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science (all databases) were searched by 2 reviewers until 29(th) October 2020. Articles were screened and narratively synthesized according to PRISMA-DTA guidelines based on predefined eligibility criteria. Articles that made direct reference test comparisons to human clinicians were evaluated using the MI-CLAIM checklist. The risk of bias was assessed by JBI-DTA critical appraisal, and certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Information regarding the quantification method of dental pain and disease, the conditional characteristics of both training and test data cohort in the machine learning, diagnostic outcomes, and diagnostic test comparisons with clinicians, where applicable, were extracted. Results. 34 eligible articles were found for data synthesis, of which 8 articles made direct reference comparisons to human clinicians. 7 papers scored over 13 (out of the evaluated 15 points) in the MI-CLAIM approach with all papers scoring 5+ (out of 7) in JBI-DTA appraisals. GRADE approach revealed serious risks of bias and inconsistencies with most studies containing more positive cases than their true prevalence in order to facilitate machine learning. Patient-perceived symptoms and clinical history were generally found to be less reliable than radiographs or histology for training accurate machine learning models. A low agreement level between clinicians training the models was suggested to have a negative impact on the prediction accuracy. Reference comparisons found nonspecialized clinicians with less than 3 years of experience to be disadvantaged against trained models. Conclusion. Machine learning in dental and orofacial healthcare has shown respectable results in diagnosing diseases with symptomatic pain and with improved future iterations and can be used as a diagnostic aid in the clinics. The current review did not internally analyze the machine learning models and their respective algorithms, nor consider the confounding variables and factors responsible for shaping the orofacial disorders responsible for eliciting pain.

TI  - Personalizing digital pain management with adapted machine learning approach
T2  - PAIN REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction:Digital therapeutics (DT) emerged and has been expanding rapidly for pain management. However, the efficacy of such approaches demonstrates substantial heterogeneity. Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a great opportunity for personalizing the efficacy of DT. However, the ML model accuracy is mainly associated with reduced clinical interpretability. Moreover, classical ML models are not adapted for the longitudinal nature of the DT follow-up data, which may also include nonlinear fluctuations.Objectives:This study presents an analytical framework for personalized pain management using piecewise mixed-effects model trees, considering the data dependencies, nonlinear trajectories, and boosting model interpretability.Methods:We demonstrated the implementation of the model with posture biofeedback training data of 3610 users collected during 8 weeks. The users reported their pain levels and posture quality. We developed personalized models for nonlinear time-related fluctuations of pain levels, posture quality, and weekly training duration using age, gender, and body mass index as potential moderating factors.Results:Pain levels and posture quality demonstrated strong improvement during the first 3 weeks of the training, followed by a sustained pattern. The age of the users moderated the time fluctuations in pain levels, whereas age and gender interactively moderated the trajectories in the posture quality. Train duration increased during the first 3 weeks only for older users, whereas all the users decreased the training duration during the next 5 weeks.Conclusions:This analytical framework offers an opportunity for investigating the personalized efficacy of digital therapeutics for pain management, taking into account users' characteristics and boosting interpretability and can benefit from including more users' characteristics.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened and hub genes were investigated using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were constructed among the co-DEGs (common genes between DEGs and hub genes), followed by functional enrichment analyses. Then, three machine learning methods were used to reveal drug targets, followed by validation, nomogram analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis. Finally, an miRNA-target network was constructed.ResultsA total of 686 DEGs were identified between the two groups-of which, 183 DEGs integrated with genes revealed by WCGNA were identified as co-genes. These genes, including contactin-associated protein 1 (CNTNAP1), are mainly involved in functions such as action potentials. PPI network analysis revealed three models, with the machine learning analysis exploring four drug target genes: A2H, FAM155B, SCARF2, and SDR16C5. ROC and nomogram analyses demonstrated the ideal diagnostic value of these target genes. Finally, miRNA-mRNA pairs were constructed based on the four mRNAs and associated 174 miRNAs.ConclusionFA2H, FAM155B, SCARF2, and SDR16C5 may be novel drug target genes for isoflurane-induced anesthesia. CNTNAP1 may participate in the progression of isoflurane-induced anesthesia via its action potential function.

TI  - Machine Learning Algorithms Can Be Reliably Leveraged to Identify Patients at High Risk of Prolonged Postoperative Opioid Use Following Orthopedic Surgery: A Systematic Review
T2  - HSS JOURNAL
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a method to determine patient-specific risk for prolonged postoperative opioid use after orthopedic procedures. Purpose: We sought to analyze the efficacy and validity of ML algorithms in identifying patients who are at high risk for prolonged opioid use following orthopedic procedures. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science Core Collection databases were queried for articles published prior to August 2021 for articles applying ML to predict prolonged postoperative opioid use following orthopedic surgeries. Features pertaining to patient demographics, surgical procedures, and ML algorithm performance were analyzed. Results: Ten studies met inclusion criteria: 4 spine, 3 knee, and 3 hip. Studies reported postoperative opioid use over 30 to 365 days and varied in defining prolonged use. Prolonged postsurgical opioid use frequency ranged from 4.3% to 40.9%. C-statistics for spine studies ranged from 0.70 to 0.81; for knee studies, 0.75 to 0.77; and for hip studies, 0.71 to 0.77. Brier scores for spine studies ranged from 0.039 to 0.076; for knee, 0.01 to 0.124; and for hip, 0.052 to 0.21. Seven articles reported calibration intercept (range: -0.02 to 0.16) and calibration slope (range: 0.88 to 1.08). Nine articles included a decision curve analysis. No investigations performed external validation. Thematic predictors of prolonged postoperative opioid use were preoperative opioid, benzodiazepine, or antidepressant use and extremes of age depending on procedure population. Conclusions: This systematic review found that ML algorithms created to predict risk for prolonged postoperative opioid use in orthopedic surgery patients demonstrate good discriminatory performance. The frequency and predictive features of prolonged postoperative opioid use identified were consistent with existing literature, although algorithms remain limited by a lack of external validation and imperfect adherence to predictive modeling guidelines.

AB  - The pandemic of the new coronavirus infection has swept the world and killed more than 5 million people, which has shocked all human beings who have believed in modern medical progress. Along with the sedation of infections, the balance between restriction and acceleration of socio-economic activities is difficult. With the spread of vaccines and the advent of viral therapeutic agents, we expect how to control this pandemic has finally become visible.In this situation, we realize that data science and robotics innovations are quite important in many medical fields. Artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis and remote medical care are becoming a reality, and this direction will accelerate further in 2022, the first year of post-pandemic. The trend of digital transformation (Dx) will also be rushing into Orthopedics next year. In addition, research on virtual reality and augmented reality is being actively conducted, and it has become possible to use it for surgical simulation and technical training. As, in the field of abdominal surgery, remote robotic surgery will soon become available in the field of orthopedics as well.These Dx trend will prevail to our field instead of experience, and knowledge of medicine, which can change the medical care style dramatically in near future. It is crucial for orthopedic surgeons to always aim for its development and evolution. (c) 2021 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effective hemodynamic monitoring
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Hemodynamic monitoring is the centerpiece of patient monitoring in acute care settings. Its effectiveness in terms of improved patient outcomes is difficult to quantify.This review focused on effectiveness of monitoring-linked resuscitation strategies from: (1) process-specific monitoring that allows for non-specific prevention of new onset cardiovascular insufficiency (CVI) in perioperative care. Such goal-directed therapy is associated with decreased perioperative complications and length of stay in high-risk surgery patients. (2) Patient-specific personalized resuscitation approaches for CVI. These approaches including dynamic measures to define volume responsiveness and vasomotor tone, limiting less fluid administration and vasopressor duration, reduced length of care. (3) Hemodynamic monitoring to predict future CVI using machine learning approaches. These approaches presently focus on predicting hypotension. Future clinical trials assessing hemodynamic monitoring need to focus on process-specific monitoring based on modifying therapeutic interventions known to improve patient-centered outcomes.

TI  - Depth of anesthesia prediction via EEG signals using convolutional neural network and ensemble empirical mode decomposition
T2  - MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - According to a recently conducted survey on surgical complication mortality rate, 47% of such cases are due to anesthetics overdose. This indicates that there is an urgent need to moderate the level of anesthesia. Recently deep learning (DL) methods have played a major role in estimating the depth of Anesthesia (DOA) of patients and has played an essential role in control anesthesia overdose. In this paper, Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been used for the prediction of DOA. EEG signals are very complex signals which may require months of training and advanced signal processing techniques. It is a point of debate whether DL methods are an improvement over the already existing traditional EEG signal processing approaches. One of the DL algorithms is Convolutional neural network (CNN) which is very popular algorithm for object recognition and is widely growing its applications in processing hierarchy in the human visual system. In this paper, various decomposition methods have been used for extracting the features EEG signal. After acquiring the necessary signals values in image format, several CNN models have been deployed for classification of DOA depending upon their Bispectral Index (BIS) and the signal quality index (SQI). The EEG signals were converted into the frequency domain using and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). However, because of the inter mode mixing observed in EMD method; EEMD have been utilized for this study. The developed CNN models were used to predict the DOA based on the EEG spectrum images without the use of handcrafted features which provides intuitive mapping with high efficiency and reliability. The best trained model gives an accuracy of 83.2%. Hence, this provides further scope and research which can be carried out in the domain of visual mapping of DOA using EEG signals and DL methods.

AB  - Post-induction hypotension frequently occurred after anesthesia induction. Avoiding post-induction hypotension is important as it is associated with postoperative adverse outcomes. Related studies have shown that the dose of anesthetic induction drugs affects the post-induction hypotension. The purpose of this study is to propose an anesthetic dose that does not cause post-induction hypotension according to the patient's condition. A model for predicting the optimal dose of an anesthetic induction drug is constructed using a regression model which is one of machine learning methods by focusing on electronic anesthesia records. The prediction coefficient of determination 0.5008 was achieved by adjusting the explanatory variables and parameters and using ridge regression.

TI  - Development and validation of a machine learning ASA-score to identify candidates for comprehensive preoperative screening and risk stratification
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The ASA physical status (ASA-PS) is determined by an anesthesia provider or surgeon to communicate co-morbidities relevant to perioperative risk. Assigning an ASA-PS is a clinical decision and there is substantial provider-dependent variability. We developed and externally validated a machine learning-derived algorithm to determine ASA-PS (ML-PS) based on data available in the medical record.Design: Retrospective multicenter hospital registry study.Setting: University-affiliated hospital networks.Patients: Patients who received anesthesia at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA, training [n = 361,602] and internal validation cohorts [n = 90,400]) and Montefiore Medical Center (Bronx, NY, external validation cohort [n = 254,412]).Measurements: The ML-PS was created using a supervised random forest model with 35 preoperatively available variables. Its predictive ability for 30-day mortality, postoperative ICU admission, and adverse discharge were determined by logistic regression.Main results: The anesthesiologist ASA-PS and ML-PS were in agreement in 57.2% of the cases (moderate inter -rater agreement). Compared with anesthesiologist rating, ML-PS assigned more patients into extreme ASA-PS (I and IV), (p < 0.01), and less patients in ASA II and III (p < 0.01). ML-PS and anesthesiologist ASA-PS had excellent predictive values for 30-day mortality, and good predictive values for postoperative ICU admission and adverse discharge. Among the 3594 patients who died within 30 days after surgery, net reclassification improvement analysis revealed that using the ML-PS, 1281 (35.6%) patients were reclassified into the higher clinical risk category compared with anesthesiologist rating. However, in a subgroup of multiple co-morbidity patients, anesthesiologist ASA-PS had a better predictive accuracy than ML-PS.Conclusions: We created and validated a machine learning physical status based on preoperatively available data. The ability to identify patients at high risk early in the preoperative process independent of the provider's de-cision is a part of the process we use to standardize the stratified preoperative evaluation of patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery.

TI  - Quantifying arousal and awareness in altered states of consciousness using interpretable deep learning
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors propose an explainable consciousness indicator using deep learning to quantify arousal and awareness under sleep, anesthesia, and in patients with disorders of consciousness.Consciousness can be defined by two components: arousal (wakefulness) and awareness (subjective experience). However, neurophysiological consciousness metrics able to disentangle between these components have not been reported. Here, we propose an explainable consciousness indicator (ECI) using deep learning to disentangle the components of consciousness. We employ electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation under various conditions, including sleep (n = 6), general anesthesia (n = 16), and severe brain injury (n = 34). We also test our framework using resting-state EEG under general anesthesia (n = 15) and severe brain injury (n = 34). ECI simultaneously quantifies arousal and awareness under physiological, pharmacological, and pathological conditions. Particularly, ketamine-induced anesthesia and rapid eye movement sleep with low arousal and high awareness are clearly distinguished from other states. In addition, parietal regions appear most relevant for quantifying arousal and awareness. This indicator provides insights into the neural correlates of altered states of consciousness.

TI  - Examining the Ability of Artificial Neural Networks Machine Learning Models to Accurately Predict Complications Following Posterior Lumbar Spine Fusion
T2  - SPINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Design. A cross-sectional database study.Objective. The aim of this study was to train and validate machine learning models to identify risk factors for complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion.Summary of Background Data. Machine learning models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are valuable tools for analyzing and interpreting large and complex datasets. ANNs have yet to be used for risk factor analysis in orthopedic surgery.Methods. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried for patients who underwent posterior lumbar spine fusion. This query returned 22,629 patients, 70% of whom were used to train our models, and 30% were used to evaluate the models. The predictive variables used included sex, age, ethnicity, diabetes, smoking, steroid use, coagulopathy, functional status, American Society for Anesthesiology (ASA) class >3, body mass index (BMI), pulmonary comorbidities, and cardiac comorbidities. The models were used to predict cardiac complications, wound complications, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and mortality. Using ASA class as a benchmark for prediction, area under receiver operating curves (AUC) was used to determine the accuracy of our machine learning models.Results. On the basis of AUC values, ANN and LR both outperformed ASA class for predicting all four types of complications. ANN was the most accurate for predicting cardiac complications, and LR was most accurate for predicting wound complications, VTE, and mortality, though ANN and LR had comparable AUC values for predicting all types of complications. ANN had greater sensitivity than LR for detecting wound complications and mortality.Conclusion. Machine learning in the form of logistic regression and ANNs were more accurate than benchmark ASA scores for identifying risk factors of developing complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion, suggesting they are potentially great tools for risk factor analysis in spine surgery.

AB  - Background/Aims: The purpose of this prospective study was to compare patients' discomfort during water immersion (WI) colonoscopy without sedation or available on request, with that of patients during air insufflation (AI) colonoscopy with sedation, in the ambulatory setting.Material and Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in 100 patients who performed a colonoscopy between August 2015 and February 2016 in an Ambulatory Gastroenterology Center in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. They were divided into two branches A and B. Patients in Group A underwent a classic colonoscopy with AI and standard sedation (2 mg of midazolam and 50 mg of tramadol), while patients in Group B underwent an unsedated or on demand sedation colonoscopy with WI technique.Results: The patients in group A presented a higher discomfort (statistically significant) compared to those in group B, and had also the median total discomfort score higher than those in group B. The patients in group A had also a higher discomfort score after examination. The total time of examination was the same in the two groups, but in group B the progression to cecum time was 3 minutes lower than for those in group A. A greater discomfort of the patient was correlated with the longer time required to reach the cecum.Conclusion: In conclusion, WI colonoscopy is superior to AI technique in reducing insertion pain, progression-to-cecum time, minimizing sedation requirements and also in the willingness to repeat the technique.

T2  - CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Perioperative neurological disorders are important causes of postoperative disability and even perioperative death, bringing a huge challenge to the vulnerable and increasing aging population. Perioperative neurological disorders usually contain ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and neurocognitive disorders during the perioperative period. Although a few prevention and treatment strategies have been developed for each disorder, there is still a lack of effective treatments and the underlying mechanisms are far from well-understood. This special issue is dedicated to introducing the recent advances in new strategies towards the management of perioperative neurological disorders. The issue collects research articles and reviews focusing on the neuroprotection mechanisms and application of novel technologies in perioperative neurological disorders, including machine learning and nano-delivery system. These works help to shed lights on developing novel therapeutic targets of perioperative neurological disorders in the pursuit of better recovery and prognosis of the surgical patients.

TI  - What are patients saying about you online? A sentiment analysis of online written reviews on Scoliosis Research Society surgeons
T2  - SPINE DEFORMITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Physician review websites have significant influence on a patient's selection of a provider, but written reviews are subjective. Sentiment analysis of writing through artificial intelligence can quantify surgeon reviews to provide actionable feedback. The objective of this study is to quantitatively analyze the written reviews of members of the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) through sentiment analysis. Methods Online written reviews and star-rating reviews of SRS surgeons were obtained from healthgrades.com, and a sentiment analysis package was used to obtain compound scores of each physician's reviews. A t test and ANOVA was performed to determine the relationship between demographic variables and average sentiment score of written reviews. Positive and negative word and word-pair frequency analysis was performed to provide context to words used to describe surgeons. Results Seven hundred and twenty-one SRS surgeon's reviews were analyzed. Analysis showed a positive correlation between the sentiment scores and overall average star-rated reviews (r(2) = 0.5, p < 0.01). There was no difference in review sentiment by provider gender. However, the age of surgeons showed a significant difference as younger surgeons, on average, had more positive reviews (p < 0.01). Conclusion The most frequently used word pairs used to describe top-rated surgeons describe compassionate providers and efficiency in pain management. Conversely, those with the worst reviews are characterized as unable to relieve pain. Through quantitative analysis of physician reviews, pain is a clear factor contributing to both positive and negative reviews of surgeons, reinforcing the need to properly manage pain expectations.

TI  - New machine learning scoring system for predicting postoperative mortality in gastroduodenal ulcer perforation: A study using a Japanese nationwide inpatient database
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Conventional prediction models for estimating risk of postoperative mortality in gastroduodenal ulcer perforation have suboptimal prediction ability. We aimed to develop and validate new machine learning models and an integer-based score for predicting the postoperative mortality.Methods: We retrospectively identified patients with gastroduodenal ulcer perforation who underwent surgical repair, using a nationwide Japanese inpatient database. In a derivation cohort from July 2010 to March 2016, we developed 2 machine learning-based models, Lasso and XGBoost, using 45 candidate predictors, and also developed an integer-based score for clinical use by including important variables in Lasso. In a validation cohort from April 2016 to March 2017, we measured the prediction performances of the models by computing area under the curve and comparing it to the conventional American Society of Anesthesiology risk score.Results: Of 25,886 patients, 1,176 (4.5%) died after surgical repair. For the validation cohort, Lasso and XGBoost had significantly higher prediction abilities than the American Society of Anesthesiology score (Lasso area under the curve = 0.84; 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.86; American Society of Anesthesiology score area under the curve = 0.70; 95% confidence interval 0.65-0.74, P<.001). The integer-based risk score, which had 13 factors, had a prediction ability similar to those of Lasso and XGBoost (area under the curve = 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.86). According to the integer-based score, the mortalities were 0.1%, 2.3%, 9.3%, and 29.0% for the low (score, 0), moderate (1-2), high (3-4), and very high (>= 5) score groups, respectively.Conclusion: Machine learning models and the integer-based risk score performed well in predicting risk of postoperative mortality in gastroduodenal ulcer perforation. These models will help in decision making. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The prognostic value of intraoperative HRV during anesthesia in patients presenting for non-cardiac surgery
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To examine the prognostic value of HRV measurements during anesthesia for postoperative clinical outcomes prediction using machine learning models.Data sources VitalDB, a comprehensive database of 6388 surgical patients admitted to Seoul National University Hospital.Eligibility criteria for study selection Cases with ECG lead II recording duration of less than one hour were excluded. Cases with more than 20% of missing HRV measurements were also excluded. A total of 5641 cases were eligible for the analyses.Methods Six machine learning models including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and an ensemble of the five baseline models were developed to predict postoperative clinical outcomes. The prediction models were trained using only clinical information, and using both clinical information and HRV features, respectively. Feature importance based on the SHAP method was used to assess the contribution of the HRV measurements to the outcome predictions. Subgroup analysis was also performed to evaluate the risk association between postoperative ICU stay and various HRV measurements such as heart rate, low-frequency power (LFP), and short-term fluctuation DFA alpha(1).Result The final cohort included 5641 unique cases, among whom 4678 (83.0%) cases had ages over 40, 2877 (51.0%) were male, 1073 (19.0%) stayed in ICU after surgery, 52 (0.9%) suffered in-hospital death, and 3167(56.1%) had a total length of hospital stay longer than 7 days. In the final test set, the highest AUROC performance with only clinical information was 0.79 for postoperative ICU stay, 0.58 for in-hospital mortality, and 0.76 for the total length of hospital stay prediction. Importantly, using both clinical information and HRV features, the AUROC performance was 0.83, 0.70, and 0.76 for the three clinical outcome predictions, respectively. Subgroup analysis found that patients with an average heart rate higher than 70, low-frequency power (LFP) < 33, and short-term fluctuation DFA alpha(1) < 0.95 during anesthesia, had a significantly higher risk of entering the ICU after surgery.Conclusion This study suggested that HRV measurements during anesthesia are feasible and effective for predicting postoperative clinical outcomes.

TI  - Deep-learning-based real-time prediction of acute kidney injury outperforms human predictive performance
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication after cardiothoracic surgery. Early prediction of AKI could prompt preventive measures, but is challenging in the clinical routine. One important reason is that the amount of postoperative data is too massive and too high-dimensional to be effectively processed by the human operator. We therefore sought to develop a deep-learning-based algorithm that is able to predict postoperative AKI prior to the onset of symptoms and complications. Based on 96 routinely collected parameters we built a recurrent neural network (RNN) for real-time prediction of AKI after cardiothoracic surgery. From the data of 15,564 admissions we constructed a balanced training set (2224 admissions) for the development of the RNN. The model was then evaluated on an independent test set (350 admissions) and yielded an area under curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval) of 0.893 (0.862-0.924). We compared the performance of our model against that of experienced clinicians. The RNN significantly outperformed clinicians (AUC = 0.901 vs. 0.745, p < 0.001) and was overall well calibrated. This was not the case for the physicians, who systematically underestimated the risk (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the RNN was superior to physicians in the prediction of AKI after cardiothoracic surgery. It could potentially be integrated into hospitals' electronic health records for real-time patient monitoring and may help to detect early AKI and hence modify the treatment in perioperative care.

T2  - 2023 EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, ECC
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - European Control Conference (ECC)
CL  - Bucharest, ROMANIA
AB  - In this paper, a data-based approach is used to predict the effect of Propofol and Remifentanil on Bispectral Index (BIS) and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) during total intravenous anesthesia. In particular, we aim to reproduce the measured data by identifying the pharmacodynamic function using machine-learning techniques. Features from the output of classic pharmacokinetic models and patient information are considered. Five learning methods are tested including linear models, support vector machine, Kernel, k-neighbors regressors, and neural-network. Learning and testing are performed on a particular subset of 150 surgery cases extracted from the VitalDB database. Results show that this approach improves the classic surface-response methods for BIS and MAP prediction and can be used for anesthesia control applications.

TI  - Deep learning classification of capnography waveforms: secondary analysis of the PRODIGY study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Capnography monitors trigger high priority 'no breath' alarms when CO2 measurements do not exceed a given threshold over a specified time-period. False alarms occur when the underlying breathing pattern is stable, but the alarm is triggered when the CO2 value reduces even slightly below the threshold. True 'no breath' events can be falsely classified as breathing if waveform artifact causes an aberrant spike in CO2 values above the threshold. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of a deep learning approach to classifying segments of capnography waveforms as either 'breath' or 'no breath'. A post hoc secondary analysis of data from 9 North American sites included in the PRediction of Opioid-induced Respiratory Depression In Patients Monitored by capnoGraphY (PRODIGY) study was conducted. We used a convolutional neural network to classify 15 s capnography waveform segments drawn from a random sample of 400 participants. Loss was calculated over batches of 32 using the binary cross-entropy loss function with weights updated using the Adam optimizer. Internal-external validation was performed by iteratively fitting the model using data from all but one hospital and then assessing its performance in the remaining hospital. The labelled dataset consisted of 10,391 capnography waveform segments. The neural network's accuracy was 0.97, precision was 0.97 and recall was 0.96. Performance was consistent across hospitals in internal-external validation. The neural network could reduce false capnography alarms. Further research is needed to compare the frequency of alarms derived from the neural network with the standard approach.

TI  - Design and Implementation of a Machine Learning Based EEG Processor for Accurate Estimation of Depth of Anesthesia
T2  - 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS (ISCAS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Accurate monitoring of the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is essential for intraoperative and postoperative patient's health. Commercially available electroencephalograph (EEG)-based DoA monitors are recommended only for certain anesthetic drugs and specific age-group patients. This paper presents a machine learning classification processor for accurate DoA estimation irrespective of the patient's age and anesthetic drug. The classification is solely based on six features extracted from EEG signal, i.e., spectral edge frequency (SEF), beta ratio, and four bands of spectral energy (FBSE). A machine learning fine decision tree classifier is adopted to achieve a four-class DoA classification (deep, moderate, and light DoA versus awake state). The feature selection and the classification processor are optimized to achieve the highest classification accuracy for the state of moderate anesthesia required for the surgical operations. The proposed 256-point fast Fourier transform accelerator is implemented to realize SEF, beta ratio, and FBSE that enables minimal latency and high accuracy feature extraction. The proposed DoA processor is implemented using a 65 nm CMOS technology and experimentally verified using field programming gate array (FPGA) based on the EEG recordings of 75 patients undergoing elective surgery with different types of anesthetic agents. The processor achieves an average accuracy of 92.2% for all DoA states, with a latency of is The 0.09 mm(2) DoA processor consumes 140nJ/classification.

TI  - The Changing Environment in Postgraduate Education in Orthopedic Surgery and Neurosurgery and Its Impact on Technology-Driven Targeted Interventional and Surgical Pain Management: Perspectives from Europe, Latin America, Asia, and The United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Personalized care models are dominating modern medicine. These models are rooted in teaching future physicians the skill set to keep up with innovation. In orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery, education is increasingly influenced by augmented reality, simulation, navigation, robotics, and in some cases, artificial intelligence. The postpandemic learning environment has also changed, emphasizing online learning and skill- and competency-based teaching models incorporating clinical and bench-top research. Attempts to improve work-life balance and minimize physician burnout have led to work-hour restrictions in postgraduate training programs. These restrictions have made it particularly challenging for orthopedic and neurosurgery residents to acquire the knowledge and skill set to meet the requirements for certification. The fast-paced flow of information and the rapid implementation of innovation require higher efficiencies in the modern postgraduate training environment. However, what is taught typically lags several years behind. Examples include minimally invasive tissue-sparing techniques through tubular small-bladed retractor systems, robotic and navigation, endoscopic, patient-specific implants made possible by advances in imaging technology and 3D printing, and regenerative strategies. Currently, the traditional roles of mentee and mentor are being redefined. The future orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons involved in personalized surgical pain management will need to be versed in several disciplines ranging from bioengineering, basic research, computer, social and health sciences, clinical study, trial design, public health policy development, and economic accountability. Solutions to the fast-paced innovation cycle in orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery include adaptive learning skills to seize opportunities for innovation with execution and implementation by facilitating translational research and clinical program development across traditional boundaries between clinical and nonclinical specialties. Preparing the future generation of surgeons to have the aptitude to keep up with the rapid technological advances is challenging for postgraduate residency programs and accreditation agencies. However, implementing clinical protocol change when the entrepreneur-investigator surgeon substantiates it with high-grade clinical evidence is at the heart of personalized surgical pain management.

TI  - Computation-assisted discovery of bioactive minor cannabinoids from hemp
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This project aims to conduct mechanistic research of potential therapeutic benefits of minor cannabinoids in hemp. We propose to integrate Artificial Intelligence in our workflow to accelerate the discovery of bioactive minor cannabinoids. We focus on chronic pain as our therapeutic benefit of non-psychoactive cannabinoids. A large body of literature suggests that terpenophenolics from hemp may have potential in the treatment of pain and other conditions that are driven by low-grade chronic inflammation. The conventional, classic approach to identify potential therapeutics derived from natural products (NPs) is laborious and time-consuming bioassay-guided fractionation. Our AI-assisted approach for the discovery of bioactive NPs accelerates the discovery pipeline, as our feasibility studies show. We expect that we will succeed in identifying bioactive cannabinoids that have previously not been studied in clinically relevant bioassays. Our Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1: To predict and validate the effects of individual cannabinoids in CBD-depleted hemp extracts in cell culture models relevant to nociception. Columbia Basin Bioscience operates an industrial scale CBD manufacturing facility which makes use of recrystallization of CBD from cannabinoid-enriched hemp extracts. We will use the supernatants of various recrystallization stages (“mother liquors”) as our source of minor cannabinoids in our computation-assisted discovery of bioactives. We will perform calcium flux assays using HEK-293 cells stably over-expressing recombinant human TRPV1 as a cell culture model relevant to nociception. We will also test for FAAH/COX-2 inhibitory activity as dual acting compounds targeting the endocannabinoid and endovanilloid systems are emerging as a novel treatment option for chronic pain management. We will validate the most potent predictors of activity by testing individual, pure cannabinoids in the same assays. We will also determine the bioactivity of 17 minor cannabinoids from our repository of cannabinoid standards, which may or may not include predictors of bioactivity from our discovery pipeline. Specific Aim 2: To predict and validate synergistic/interactive effects between bioactive cannabinoids. Our AI-discovery pipeline has the ability to detect synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects based on measurements of absolute concentrations of NPs in crude fractions containing bioactive cannabinoids for which we will establish concentration-effect curves. We will quantify the pharmacological interactions among a subset of authentic cannabinoids including 17 minor cannabinoids from our repository of standards which show bioactivity in our assays or which have been reported to attenuate TRPV1-related pain signaling. We expect that the proposed AI-assisted discovery approach will generate cannabinoid candidates that attenuate nociceptive TRPV1-FAAH/COX-1 signaling pathways for further mechanistic testing in preclinical models of pain sensation. The development of minor cannabinoids as pain mitigators from waste products of the CBD-industry will benefit not only chronic pain patients but also a sustainable agro-industry.

TI  - Closed-Loop Control of Anesthesia: Survey on Actual Trends, Challenges and Perspectives
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Automation empowers self-sustainable adaptive processes and personalized services in many industries. The implementation of the integrated healthcare paradigm built on Health 4.0 is expected to transform any area in medicine due to the lightning-speed advances in control, robotics, artificial intelligence, sensors etc. The two objectives of this article, as addressed to different entities, are: i) to raise awareness throughout the anesthesiologists about the usefulness of integrating automation and data exchange in their clinical practice for providing increased attention to alarming situations, ii) to provide the actualized insights of drug-delivery research in order to create an opening horizon towards precision medicine with significantly improved human outcomes. This article presents a concise overview on the recent evolution of closed-loop anesthesia delivery control systems by means of control strategies, depth of anesthesia monitors, patient modelling, safety systems, and validation in clinical trials. For decades, anesthesia control has been in the midst of transformative changes, going from simple controllers to integrative strategies of two or more components, but not achieving yet the breakthrough of an integrated system. However, the scientific advances that happen at high speed need a modern review to identify the current technological gaps, societal implications, and implementation barriers. This article provides a good basis for control research in clinical anesthesia to endorse new challenges for intelligent systems towards individualized patient care. At this connection point of clinical and engineering frameworks through (semi-) automation, the following can be granted: patient safety, economical efficiency, and clinicians' efficacy.

TI  - Improving the efficiency of the operating room environment with an optimization and machine learning model
T2  - HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The operating room is a major cost and revenue center for most hospitals. Thus, more effective operating room management and scheduling can provide significant benefits. In many hospitals, the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), where patients recover after their surgical procedures, is a bottleneck. If the PACU reaches capacity, patients must wait in the operating room until the PACU has available space, leading to delays and possible cancellations for subsequent operating room procedures. We develop a generalizable optimization and machine learning approach to sequence operating room procedures to minimize delays caused by PACU unavailability. Specifically, we use machine learning to estimate the required PACU time for each type of surgical procedure, we develop and solve two integer programming models to schedule procedures in the operating rooms to minimize maximum PACU occupancy, and we use discrete event simulation to compare our optimized schedule to the existing schedule. Using data from Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, we show that the scheduling system can significantly reduce operating room delays caused by PACU congestion while still keeping operating room utilization high: simulation of the second half of 2016 shows that our model could have reduced total PACU holds by 76% without decreasing operating room utilization. We are currently working on implementing the scheduling system at the hospital.

TI  - Derivation and Validation of an Ensemble Model for the Prediction of Agitation in Mechanically Ventilated Patients Maintained Under Light Sedation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES:Light sedation is recommended over deep sedation for invasive mechanical ventilation to improve clinical outcome but may increase the risk of agitation. This study aimed to develop and prospectively validate an ensemble machine learning model for the prediction of agitation on a daily basis.DESIGN:Variables collected in the early morning were used to develop an ensemble model by aggregating four machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, C5.0, adaptive boosting with classification trees, and extreme gradient boosting with classification trees, to predict the occurrence of agitation in the subsequent 24 hours.SETTING:The training dataset was prospectively collected in 95 ICUs from 80 Chinese hospitals on May 11, 2016, and the validation dataset was collected in 20 out of these 95 ICUs on December 16, 2019.PATIENTS:Invasive mechanical ventilation patients who were maintained under light sedation for 24 hours prior to the study day and who were to be maintained at the same sedation level for the next 24 hours.INTERVENTIONS:None.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:A total of 578 invasive mechanical ventilation patients from 95 ICUs in 80 Chinese hospitals, including 459 in the training dataset and 119 in the validation dataset, were enrolled. Agitation was observed in 36% (270/578) of the invasive mechanical ventilation patients. The stepwise regression model showed that higher body temperature (odds ratio for 1 degrees C increase: 5.29; 95% CI, 3.70-7.84; p < 0.001), greater minute ventilation (odds ratio for 1 L/min increase: 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30; p = 0.019), higher Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (odds ratio for 1-point increase: 2.43; 95% CI, 1.92-3.16; p < 0.001), and days on invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio for 1-d increase: 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98; p = 0.001) were independently associated with agitation in the subsequent 24 hours. In the validation dataset, the ensemble model showed good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.918; 95% CI, 0.866-0.969) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test p = 0.459) in predicting the occurrence of agitation within 24 hours.CONCLUSIONS:This study developed an ensemble model for the prediction of agitation in invasive mechanical ventilation patients under light sedation. The model showed good calibration and discrimination in an independent dataset.

T2  - 2022 20TH IEEE INTERREGIONAL NEWCAS CONFERENCE (NEWCAS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 20th IEEE Interregional NEWCAS Conference (IEEE NEWCAS)
CL  - Quebec City, CANADA
AB  - Monitoring the depth of anesthesia (DoA) during surgical procedures is very critical for patients' health. Any inaccurate dosage of the anesthetic agents can result in postoperative health issues or complications such as comma or intraoperative awareness. The accurate estimation of DoA using the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is still a problem in many DoA monitors. This paper proposes a novel approach for accurate DoA estimation based on Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) spectral features while using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor Network for the prediction of DoA index. The regressor utilizes an optimized temporal, fractal, and spectral feature set to identify the patient's conscious level irrespective of age and the type of anesthetic agent. The proposed algorithm is validated on 95 patients (age 5 months-67 years), (weight: 6 - 90 Kg). The anesthetic agents used in this study include Propofol, Sevoflurane, Isoflurane, Fentanyl, Ketamine, and Caudal. The proposed DoA regressor outperforms the state-of-the-art DoA prediction algorithms by predicting highly accurate DoA indexes with an overall Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.014 and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.02 while utilizing minimized feature set and a deep learning-based MLP regression network. The minimized feature set allows efficient implementation on-chip.

TI  - Deep-learning model for predicting 30-day postoperative mortality
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Postoperative mortality occurs in 1-2% of patients undergoing major inpatient surgery. The currently available prediction tools using summaries of intraoperative data are limited by their inability to reflect shifting risk associated with intraoperative physiological perturbations. We sought to compare similar benchmarks to a deep-learning algorithm predicting postoperative 30-day mortality.Methods: We constructed a multipath convolutional neural network model using patient characteristics, co-morbid conditions, preoperative laboratory values, and intraoperative numerical data from patients undergoing surgery with tracheal intubation at a single medical centre. Data for 60 min prior to a randomly selected time point were utilised. Model performance was compared with a deep neural network, a random forest, a support vector machine, and a logistic regression using predetermined summary statistics of intraoperative data.Results: Of 95 907 patients, 941 (1%) died within 30 days. The multipath convolutional neural network predicted postoperative 30-day mortality with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.867 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.835-0.899). This was higher than that for the deep neural network (0.825; 95% CI: 0.790-0.860), random forest (0.848; 95% CI: 0.815-0.882), support vector machine (0.836; 95% CI: 0.802-870), and logistic regression (0.837; 95% CI: 0.803-0.871).Conclusions: A deep-learning time-series model improves prediction compared with models with simple summaries of intraoperative data. We have created a model that can be used in real time to detect dynamic changes in a patient's risk for postoperative mortality.

TI  - Defining Clinically Meaningful Subgroups for Risk Stratification in Patients Undergoing Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Combined Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTHROPLASTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Studies developing predictive models from large datasets to risk-stratify patients under going revision total hip arthroplasties (rTHAs) are limited. We used machine learning (ML) to stratify patients undergoing rTHA into risk-based subgroups. Methods: We retrospectively identified 7,425 patients who underwent rTHA from a national database. An unsupervised random forest algorithm was used to partition patients into high-risk and low-risk strata based on similarities in rates of mortality, reoperation, and 25 other postoperative complications. A risk calculator was produced using a supervised ML algorithm to identify high-risk patients based on preoperative parameters. 'Results: There were 3,135 and 4,290 patients identified in the high-risk and low-risk subgroups, respectively. Each group significantly differed by rate of 30-day mortalities, unplanned reoperations/ readmissions, routine discharges, and hospital lengths of stay (P < .05). An Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm identified preoperative platelets < 200, hematocrit > 35 or < 20, increasing age, albumin < 3, international normalized ratio > 2, body mass index > 35, American Society of Anesthesia class >= 3, blood urea nitrogen > 50 or < 30, creatinine > 1.5, diagnosis of hypertension or coagulopathy, and revision for periprosthetic fracture and infection as predictors of high risk. Conclusion: Clinically meaningful risk strata in patients undergoing rTHA were identified using an ML clustering approach. Preoperative labs, demographics, and surgical indications have the greatest impact on differentiating high versus low risk.'Level of evidence: III.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Implementation of Machine Learning to Predict Cost of Care Associated with Ambulatory Single-Level Lumbar Decompression
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - - BACKGROUND: With the emergence of the concept of value-based care, efficient resource allocation has become an increasingly prominent factor in surgical decision - making. Validated machine learning (ML) models for cost prediction in outpatient spine surgery are limited. As such, we developed and internally validated a supervised ML algorithm to reliably identify cost drivers associated with ambulatory single-level lumbar decompression surgery. - METHODS: A retrospective review of the New York State Ambulatory Surgical Database was performed to identify patients who underwent single-level lumbar decompression from 2014 to 2015. Patients with a length of stay of >0 were excluded. Using pre- and intraoperative parameters (features) derived from the New York State Ambulatory Surgical Database, an optimal supervised ML model was ultimately developed and internally validated after 5 candidate models were rigorously tested, trained, and compared for predictive performance related to total charges. The best performing model was then evaluated by testing its performance on identifying relationships be- tween features of interest and cost prediction. Finally, the best performing algorithm was entered into an open - access web application. RESULTS: A total of 8402 patients were included. The gradient-boosted ensemble model demonstrated the best performance assessed via internal validation. Major cost drivers included anesthesia type, operating room time, race, patient income and insurance status, community type, worker's compensation status, and comorbidity index. - CONCLUSIONS: The gradient-boosted ensemble model predicted total charges and associated cost drivers associated with ambulatory single-level lumbar decompression using a large, statewide database with excellent performance. External validation of this algorithm in future studies may guide practical application of this clinical tool.

TI  - CVCC Model: Learning-Based Computer Vision Color Constancy with RiR-DSN Architecture
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve computer vision color constancy (CVCC), it is vital but challenging to estimate scene illumination from a digital image, which distorts the true color of an object. Estimating illumination as accurately as possible is fundamental to improving the quality of the image processing pipeline. CVCC has a long history of research and has significantly advanced, but it has yet to overcome some limitations such as algorithm failure or accuracy decreasing under unusual circumstances. To cope with some of the bottlenecks, this article presents a novel CVCC approach that introduces a residual-in-residual dense selective kernel network (RiR-DSN). As its name implies, it has a residual network in a residual network (RiR) and the RiR houses a dense selective kernel network (DSN). A DSN is composed of selective kernel convolutional blocks (SKCBs). The SKCBs, or neurons herein, are interconnected in a feed-forward fashion. Every neuron receives input from all its preceding neurons and feeds the feature maps into all its subsequent neurons, which is how information flows in the proposed architecture. In addition, the architecture has incorporated a dynamic selection mechanism into each neuron to ensure that the neuron can modulate filter kernel sizes depending on varying intensities of stimuli. In a nutshell, the proposed RiR-DSN architecture features neurons called SKCBs and a residual block in a residual block, which brings several benefits such as alleviation of the vanishing gradients, enhancement of feature propagation, promotion of the reuse of features, modulation of receptive filter sizes depending on varying intensities of stimuli, and a dramatic drop in the number of parameters. Experimental results highlight that the RiR-DSN architecture performs well above its state-of-the-art counterparts, as well as proving to be camera- and illuminant-invariant.

TI  - General anesthesia enhances lesion quality and ablation efficiency of circumferential pulmonary vein isolation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARRHYTHMIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is the cornerstone of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. General anesthesia (GA) resolves the problem of pain intolerability and provides regular respiratory mode which might improve the catheter maneuverability of AF ablation. This study aims to compare the procedural performance of PVI under GA versus conscious sedation (CS) from multiple perspectives.Methods: A total of 36 consecutive patients undergoing first AF ablation under GA were enrolled in GA group. Another 109 patients receiving AF ablation under CS in the same period were selected as the control group. After propensity score matching, 29 matched pairs with similar baseline characteristics were available for further analysis. The AIFV (using AI to analyze the raw data from CARTO3 system) system was used to evaluate six procedural parameters in each PVI procedure.Results: Compared with CS, PVI under GA had a significantly shorter total PVI time (51.4 min vs. 67.8 min; p = .003) and higher radiofrequency ratio (62.6% vs. 55.8%; p = .032). The number of gaps (1.0 vs. 3.0; p < .001) and the rate of break point were significantly lower in the GA group. GA was also associated with a higher effective ablation-index ratio (87.5% vs. 74.1%; p < .001) and effective force-over-time ratio (85.3% vs. 69.2%; p = .001). After a medium follow-up time of 24 months, 12/29 (41.4%) patients in the CS group and 6/29 (20.7%) patients in the GA group suffered from AF recurrence (p = .156).Conclusions: GA improves the lesion quality and procedural efficiency of PVI from multiple perspectives evaluated by the AIFV system.

TI  - Prescription Opioid Laws and Opioid Dispensing in US Counties <i>Identifying Salient Law Provisions With Machine Learning</i>
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hundreds of laws aimed at reducing inappropriate prescription opioid dispensing have been implemented in the United States, yet heterogeneity in provisions and their simultaneous implementation have complicated evaluation of impacts. We apply a hypothesis-generating, multistage, machine-learning approach to identify salient law provisions and combinations associated with dispensing rates to test in future research.Methods: Using 162 prescription opioid law provisions capturing prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) access, reporting and administration features, pain management clinic provisions, and prescription opioid limits, we used regularization approaches and random forest models to identify laws most predictive of county-level and high-dose dispensing. We stratified analyses by overdose epidemic phases-the prescription opioid phase (2006-2009), heroin phase (2010-2012), and fentanyl phase (2013-2016)-to further explore pattern shifts over time.Results: PDMP patient data access provisions most consistently predicted high-dispensing and high-dose dispensing counties. Pain management clinic-related provisions did not generally predict dispensing measures in the prescription opioid phase but became more discriminant of high dispensing and high-dose dispensing counties over time, especially in the fentanyl period. Predictive performance across models was poor, suggesting prescription opioid laws alone do not strongly predict dispensing.Conclusions: Our systematic analysis of 162 law provisions identified patient data access and several pain management clinic provisions as predictive of county prescription opioid dispensing patterns. Future research employing other types of study designs is needed to test these provisions' causal relationships with inappropriate dispensing and to examine potential interactions between PDMP access and pain management clinic provisions.

TI  - Predicting Postoperative Mortality With Deep Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing: Model Development and Validation
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Machine learning (ML) achieves better predictions of postoperative mortality than previous prediction tools. Free-text descriptions of the preoperative diagnosis and the planned procedure are available preoperatively. Because reading these descriptions helps anesthesiologists evaluate the risk of the surgery, we hypothesized that deep learning (DL) models with unstructured text could improve postoperative mortality prediction. However, it is challenging to extract meaningful concept embeddings from this unstructured clinical text. Objective: This study aims to develop a fusion DL model containing structured and unstructured features to predict the in-hospital 30-day postoperative mortality before surgery. ML models for predicting postoperative mortality using preoperative data with or without free clinical text were assessed. Methods: We retrospectively collected preoperative anesthesia assessments, surgical information, and discharge summaries of patients undergoing general and neuraxial anesthesia from electronic health records (EHRs) from 2016 to 2020. We first compared the deep neural network (DNN) with other models using the same input features to demonstrate effectiveness. Then, we combined the DNN model with bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to extract information from clinical texts. The effects of adding text information on the model performance were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Statistical significance was evaluated using P<.05. Results: The final cohort contained 121,313 patients who underwent surgeries. A total of 1562 (1.29%) patients died within 30 days of surgery. Our BERT-DNN model achieved the highest AUROC (0.964, 95% CI 0.961-0.967) and AUPRC (0.336, 95% CI 0.276-0.402). The AUROC of the BERT-DNN was significantly higher compared to logistic regression (AUROC=0.952, 95% CI 0.949-0.955) and the American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status (ASAPS AUROC=0.892, 95% CI 0.887-0.896) but not significantly higher compared to the DNN (AUROC=0.959, 95% CI 0.956-0.962) and the random forest (AUROC=0.961, 95% CI 0.958-0.964). The AUPRC of the BERT-DNN was significantly higher compared to the DNN (AUPRC=0.319, 95% CI 0.260-0.384), the random forest (AUPRC=0.296, 95% CI 0.239-0.360), logistic regression (AUPRC=0.276, 95% CI 0.220-0.339), and the ASAPS (AUPRC=0.149, 95% CI 0.107-0.203). Conclusions: Our BERT-DNN model has an AUPRC significantly higher compared to previously proposed models using no text and an AUROC significantly higher compared to logistic regression and the ASAPS. This technique helps identify patients with higher risk from the surgical description text in EHRs.

AB  - PROJECT SUMMARYThe HEAL Data Ecosystem is working to collect data across its projects and networks to meet FAIR (Findable,Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data standards. Bringing diverse data sources together will requirecomplex data solutions to have a highly successful and accessible HEAL data commons. Meeting these datagoals brings two major challenges. The first is there are existing siloed datasets that are not yet able to becombined with other data limiting the findability and accessibility. The second is collecting and organizingprospective data so that one could assure data quality and integrity that allows for interoperability and reuse ofthe data. To accomplish this goal, this proposal responds to the request for strategies to make data moremachine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI ready). The focus of the parent grant is to create a researchframework for the HEAL IMPOWR network and larger scientific community to harmonize combined chronicpain (CP) and opioid use disorder (OUD) data. This administrative supplement expands this mission beyondthe scope of the NIH HEAL IMPOWR network to existing and future CP and OUD. The proposed work willsignificantly deepen and augment approaches to FAIR principles in CP and OUD data for both the HEALnetwork and larger NIH research community. It enhances the rigor of the parent grant by improving the largerdata relevance of what we are doing beyond the NIH HEAL IMPOWR network. The long-term goal is to build aHEAL Data Ecosystem that incorporates existing data and supports the integration of prospective CP and OUDdata collection. Building on our prior work, the overall objective of this project is to move CP and OUD data onestep closer to FAIR by leveraging existing datasets and developing tools for new projects. The generalhypothesis of the project is that leveraging existing CP & OUD data and collecting new data using ML/AI dataquality standards will accelerate the impact of the HEAL Data Ecosystem. The general hypothesis will betested by the following specific aims: (1) Transform existing dataset by mapping chronic pain/OUD CDE todemonstrate use case for making existing siloed data into a ML/AI ready format by automatically suggestingHEAL CDE annotations for already collected data based on semantic and syntactic analysis. (2) Adapt tools tosupport ML/AI readiness for existing and prospectively collected HEAL CDE. First, we will adapt our previouslydeveloped tools to measure and assess the semantic distance for pain/OUD CDE. This will support thedevelopment of federated transfer learning by assessing the quantitative distances using SHAP modeling ofpreviously collected data. We hypothesize that these tools will provide infrastructure necessary to successfullydevelop ML/AI ready data. In aim 1, we believe that transforming existing datasets to be ML/AI ready willaccelerate the harmonization of existing and prospective data for a future HEAL Data Commons. In aim 2, thedevelopment of CDE tools will support the data infrastructure quality checks to support ML/AI. The expectedoutcome of this project is data optimization pipelines and tools to support the goal of ML/AI ready data. Theresults will provide a strong basis for further development of the HEAL Data Ecosystem.

TI  - Development and validation of machine learning based prediction model for postoperative pain risk after extraction of impacted mandibular third molars
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Predicting postoperative pain risk in patients with impacted mandibular third molar extractions is helpful in guiding clinical decision-making, enhancing perioperative pain management, and improving the patients' medical experience. This study aims to develop a prediction model based on machine learning algorithms to identify patients at high risk of postoperative pain after tooth extraction. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study. Outpatients with impacted mandibular third molars were recruited and the outcome was defined as the NRS (Numerical Rating Scale) score of peak postoperative pain within 24 h after the operation >= 7, which is considered a high risk of postoperative pain. We compared the models built using nine different machine learning algorithms and conducted internal and time-series external validations to evaluate the model's predictive performances in terms of the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-value. Results: A total of 185 patients and 202 cases of impacted mandibular third molar data were included in this study. Five modeling variables were screened out using least absolute selection and shrinkage operator regression, including physician qualification, patient self-reported maximum pain sensitivity, OHI-S-CI, BMI, and systolic blood pressure. The overall performance of the random forest model was evaluated. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the prediction model built using the random forest method were 0.879 (0.861-0.891), 0.857, and 0.846, respectively, for the training set and 0.724 (0.673-0.732), 0.667, and 0.600, respectively, for the time series validation set. Conclusions: This study developed a machine learning-based postoperative pain risk prediction model for impacted mandibular third molar extraction, which is promising for providing a theoretical basis for better pain management to reduce postoperative pain after third molar extraction.

TI  - Hierarchical Poincare analysis for anaesthesia monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the degree of dispersion in Poincare plots of electroencephalograms (EEG), termed the Poincare-index, detects the depth of anaesthesia, the Poincare-index becomes estranged from the bispectral index (BIS) at lighter anaesthesia levels. The present study introduces Poincare-index(20-30 Hz), targeting the 20- to 30-Hz frequency, as the frequency range reported to contain large electromyogram (EMG) portions in frontal EEG. We combined Poincare-index(20-30 Hz) with the conventional Poincare-index(0.5-47 Hz) using a deep learning technique to adjust to BIS values, and examined whether this layered Poincare analysis can provide an index of anaesthesia level like BIS. A total of 83,867 datasets of these two Poincare-indices and BIS-monitor-derived parameters were continuously obtained every 3 s from 30 patients throughout general anaesthesia, and were randomly divided into 75% for a training dataset and 25% for a test dataset. Two Poincare-indices and two supplemental EEG parameters (EMG(70-110 Hz), suppression ratio) in the training dataset were trained in a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), with reference to BIS as supervisor. We then evaluated the trained MLPNN model using the test dataset, by comparing the measured BIS (mBIS) with BIS predicted from the model (PredBIS). The relationship between mBIS and PredBIS using the two Poincare-indices showed a tight linear regression equation: mBIS = 1.00 x PredBIS + 0.15, R = 0.87, p < 0.0001, root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.09, while the relationship between mBIS and PredBIS simply using the original Poincare-index(0.5-47 Hz) was weaker (R = 0.82, p < 0.0001, RMSE = 7.32). This suggests the 20- to 30-Hz hierarchical Poincare analysis has potential to improve on anaesthesia depth monitoring constructed by simple Poincare analysis.

TI  - Development and performance assessment of novel machine learning models to predict pneumonia after liver transplantation
T2  - RESPIRATORY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pneumonia is the most frequently encountered postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), which cause high morbidity and mortality rates. We aimed to develop a model to predict postoperative pneumonia in OLT patients using machine learning (ML) methods.Methods: Data of 786 adult patients underwent OLT at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 2015 to September 2019 was retrospectively extracted from electronic medical records and randomly subdivided into a training set and a testing set. With the training set, six ML models including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and gradient boosting machine (GBM) were developed. These models were assessed by the area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic on the testing set. The related risk factors and outcomes of pneumonia were also probed based on the chosen model.Results: 591 OLT patients were eventually included and 253 (42.81%) were diagnosed with postoperative pneumonia, which was associated with increased postoperative hospitalization and mortality (P<0.05). Among the six ML models, XGBoost model performed best. The AUC of XGBoost model on the testing set was 0.734 (sensitivity: 52.6%; specificity: 77.5%). Pneumonia was notably associated with 14 items features: INR, HCT, PLT, ALB, ALT, FIB, WBC, PT, serum Na+, TBIL, anesthesia time, preoperative length of stay, total fluid transfusion and operation time.Conclusion: Our study firstly demonstrated that the XGBoost model with 14 common variables might predict postoperative pneumonia in OLT patients.

TI  - Feasibility interventional study investigating PAIN in neurorehabilitation through wearabLE SensorS (PAINLESS): a study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionMillions of people survive injuries to the central or peripheral nervous system for which neurorehabilitation is required. In addition to the physical and cognitive impairments, many neurorehabilitation patients experience pain, often not widely recognised and inadequately treated. This is particularly true for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, for whom pain is one of the most common symptoms. In clinical practice, pain assessment is usually conducted based on a subjective estimate. This approach can lead to inaccurate evaluations due to the influence of numerous factors, including emotional or cognitive aspects. To date, no objective and simple to use clinical methods allow objective quantification of pain and the diagnostic differentiation between the two main types of pain (nociceptive vs neuropathic). Wearable technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to bridge this gap by continuously monitoring patients' health parameters and extracting meaningful information from them. Therefore, we propose to develop a new automatic AI-powered tool to assess pain and its characteristics during neurorehabilitation treatments using physiological signals collected by wearable sensors.Methods and analysisWe aim to recruit 15 participants suffering from MS undergoing physiotherapy treatment. During the study, participants will wear a wristband for three consecutive days and be monitored before and after their physiotherapy sessions. Measurement of traditionally used pain assessment questionnaires and scales (ie, painDETECT, Doleur Neuropathique 4 Questions, EuroQoL-5-dimension-3-level) and physiological signals (photoplethysmography, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, accelerometer data) will be collected. Relevant parameters from physiological signals will be identified, and AI algorithms will be used to develop automatic classification methods.Ethics and disseminationThe study has been approved by the local Ethical Committee (285-2022-SPER-AUSLBO). Participants are required to provide written informed consent. The results will be disseminated through contributions to international conferences and scientific journals, and they will also be included in a doctoral dissertation.Trial registration numberNCT05747040.

TI  - Electroencephalographic Evidence for Individual Neural Inertia in Mice That Decreases With Time
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that the brain has an intrinsic resistance to changes in arousal state. This resistance is most easily measured at the population level in the setting of general anesthesia and has been termed neural inertia. To date, no study has attempted to determine neural inertia in individuals. We hypothesize that individuals with markedly increased or decreased neural inertia might be at increased risk for complications related to state transitions, from awareness under anesthesia, to delayed emergence or confusion/impairment after emergence. Hence, an improved theoretical and practical understanding of neural inertia may have the potential to identify individuals at increased risk for these complications. This study was designed to explicitly measure neural inertia in individuals and empirically test the stochastic model of neural inertia using spectral analysis of the murine EEG. EEG was measured after induction of and emergence from isoflurane administered near the EC50 dose for loss of righting in genetically inbred mice on a timescale that minimizes pharmacokinetic confounds. Neural inertia was assessed by employing classifiers constructed using linear discriminant or supervised machine learning methods to determine if features of EEG spectra reliably demonstrate path dependence at steady-state anesthesia. We also report the existence of neural inertia at the individual level, as well as the population level, and that neural inertia decreases over time, providing direct empirical evidence supporting the predictions of the stochastic model of neural inertia.

TI  - Novel Deep Learning Tools for Clinical Decision Support in Postoperative Pain Management
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - AbstractPostoperative pain (POP) burdens millions of Americans, and it costs hundreds of billions dollars to the UShealthcare system annually. Poorly managed acute POP often leads to increased morbidity, mortality, and manyother complications, such as chronic POP and opioid overuse. Accurate prediction of POP outcomes and in-depthunderstandings of causal mechanisms of POP is critical to develop effective POP management. Also, many POPstudies indicate heterogeneity of responses to anesthesia methods and postoperative substance use, suggestinga critical need for effective methods to accurately identify patient subgroups for more effective POP managementtailored to the individual patient's needs. However, achieving these goals is challenging due to the complexPOP mechanisms and limited data from ideal large randomized controlled trials. On the other hand, abundantobservational POP data found in surgery patients' electronic health records (EHRs) are readily available, andthey can serve as a cost-effective alternative to address the critical challenges in POP management. However, the etiology of POP is intricate, i.e. many factors may interweave with each other and impact POPoutcomes non-linearly and non-additively, introducing daunting modeling challenges. Furthermore, confounding,a major concern associated with observational data, represents a particular challenge for conducting causalanalysis on POP data. Also, POP outcomes such as POP intensity scores are often irregularly and repeatedlymeasured, and distributed non-normally with two distinct data processes, requiring more advanced analysismethods. This proposal aims to overcome these analytic and modeling challenges with state-of-the-art deeplearning methods to improve POP management. Speciﬁcally, we will 1) establish robust deep learning models formore accurate predictions of both acute and chronic POP to achieve timely POP control and care; 2) develop validdeep learning based semi-parametric methods to identify true causal factors and mechanisms of POP to designmore effective POP management interventions; and 3) build powerful models to conduct robust hidden subgroupanalysis to develop the optimal POP management tailored to the individual patient's needs. Methods developedin Aims 1 3 are motivated and will be tested by two unique data: a large EHR data from the University of NorthCarolina at Chapel Hill's Carolina Data Warehouse for Health (CDW-H), and a high-quality cohort data from NIH-funded TEMporal PostOperative Pain Signatures study, which complements the CDW-H in scale and scope. Theproject will elucidate the scientiﬁc underpinnings of POP mechanisms and provide improved POP management.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th International Symposium on Medical Information Processing and Analysis
CL  - Mazatlan, MEXICO
AB  - This paper presents a quantitative imaging method and software technology to predict the risk and assess the severity of respiratory diseases in premature babies by fusing information from multiple sources: non-invasive low-radiation chest X-ray (CXR) imaging and clinical parameters. Prematurity is the largest single cause of death in children under five in the world. Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are the top cause of hospitalization and mortality in prematurity. However, there is no objective clinical marker to predict and prevent severe LRTI in the 15 million babies born prematurely every year worldwide. Traditionally, imaging biomarkers of lung disease from computed tomography have been successfully used in adults, but they entail heightened risks for children due to cumulative radiation and the need for sedation. The proposed technology is the first approach that uses low-radiation CXR imaging to predict hospitalization due to LRTI in prematurity. The method uses deep learning to quantify heterogeneous patterns (air trapping and irregular opacities) in the chest, which are combined with clinical parameters to predict the risk of LRTI. Our preliminary results obtained using a data obtained from ten premature subjects with LRTI showed high correlation between our imaging biomarkers and the rehospitalization of these subjects (R-2 = 0.98).

AB  - Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion-guided biopsy and brachytherapy (BT) offer promising diagnostic and therapeutic improvements to conventional practice for prostate cancer. One key component of these procedures is accurate segmentation of the prostate in three-dimensional (3D) TRUS images to define margins used for accurate targeting and guidance techniques. However, manual prostate segmentation is a time-consuming and difficult process that must be completed by the physician intraoperatively, often while the patient is under sedation (biopsy) or anesthetic (BT). Providing physicians with a quick and accurate prostate segmentation immediately after acquiring a 3D TRUS image could benefit multiple minimally invasive prostate interventional procedures and greatly reduce procedure time. Our solution to this limitation is the development of a convolutional neural network to segment the prostate in 3D TRUS images using multiple commercial ultrasound systems. Training of a modified U-Net was performed on 84 end-fire and 122 side-fire 3D TRUS images acquired during clinical biopsy and BT procedures. Our approach for 3D segmentation involved prediction on 2D radial slices, which were reconstructed into a 3D geometry. Manual contours provided the annotations needed for the training, validation, and testing datasets, with the testing dataset consisting of 20 unseen 3D side-fire images. Pixel map comparisons (Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall, and precision) and volume percent difference (VPD) were computed to assess error in the segmentation algorithm. Our algorithm performed with a 93.5% median DSC and 5.89% median VPD with a <0.7 s computation time, offering the possibility for reduced treatment time during prostate interventional procedures.*norland2@uwo.ca, dgillie@uwo.ca

TI  - Forecasting a Crisis: Machine-Learning Models Predict Occurrence of Intraoperative Bradycardia Associated With Hypotension
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND:Predictive analytics systems may improve perioperative care by enhancing preparation for, recognition of, and response to high-risk clinical events. Bradycardia is a fairly common and unpredictable clinical event with many causes; it may be benign or become associated with hypotension requiring aggressive treatment. Our aim was to build models to predict the occurrence of clinically significant intraoperative bradycardia at 3 time points during an operative course by utilizing available preoperative electronic medical record and intraoperative anesthesia information management system data.METHODS:The analyzed data include 62,182 scheduled noncardiac procedures performed at the University of Washington Medical Center between 2012 and 2017. The clinical event was defined as severe bradycardia (heart rate <50 beats per minute) followed by hypotension (mean arterial pressure <55 mm Hg) within a 10-minute window. We developed models to predict the presence of at least 1 event following 3 time points: induction of anesthesia (TP1), start of the procedure (TP2), and 30 minutes after the start of the procedure (TP3). Predictor variables were based on data available before each time point and included preoperative patient and procedure data (TP1), followed by intraoperative minute-to-minute patient monitor, ventilator, intravenous fluid, infusion, and bolus medication data (TP2 and TP3). Machine-learning and logistic regression models were developed, and their predictive abilities were evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The contribution of the input variables to the models were evaluated.RESULTS:The number of events was 3498 (5.6%) after TP1, 2404 (3.9%) after TP2, and 1066 (1.7%) after TP3. Heart rate was the strongest predictor for events after TP1. Occurrence of a previous event, mean heart rate, and mean pulse rates before TP2 were the strongest predictor for events after TP2. Occurrence of a previous event, mean heart rate, mean pulse rates before TP2 (and their interaction), and 15-minute slopes in heart rate and blood pressure before TP2 were the strongest predictors for events after TP3. The best performing machine-learning models including all cases produced an AUC of 0.81 (TP1), 0.87 (TP2), and 0.89 (TP3) with positive predictive values of 0.30, 0.29, and 0.15 at 95% specificity, respectively.CONCLUSIONS:We developed models to predict unstable bradycardia leveraging preoperative and real-time intraoperative data. Our study demonstrates how predictive models may be utilized to predict clinical events across multiple time intervals, with a future goal of developing real-time, intraoperative, decision support.

TI  - Immersion and haptic feedback impacts on dental anesthesia technical skills virtual reality training
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Administering anesthesia to the inferior alveolar nerve is 1 of the most stressful processes in dental training. Most studies using virtual reality (VR) for dental training have used non-immersive technologies. The purpose of this work is to assess the impact of immersive technologies on skills training.Methods On May 2019, an experimental study was conducted with 163 clinical dental students, divided into 4 groups across 2 phases (preceptorship and training) with haptic feedback either On or Off. The participants trained on the inferior alveolar dental anesthesia procedure in a haptic VR simulator. Their technical skills were evaluated in terms of needle insertion features which were computed from a haptic device providing kinematic data. Also, the participants reported their subjective experience with syringe handling and simulator sickness. A machine learning method was implemented to automatically evaluate the needle insertion point performance of the student.Results Groups receiving immersive preceptorship and/or immersive training showed more accuracy and confidence in administering the anesthesia. Participants perceived a high sense of realism with the haptic feedback when handling the syringe. The machine learning method was validated, with an accuracy of 84%, as a good classifier to assess a student's needle insertion point performance.Conclusions The immersive VR simulator allows the practice of the inferior alveolar nerve block under near real conditions and with immediate feedback to the dental student with respect to the needle insertion point. This machine learning based automatic evaluation provides a method to improve technical skills, contributing to dental training.

TI  - Intraoperative use of the machine learning-derived nociception level monitor results in less pain in the first 90 min after surgery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PAIN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this pooled analysis of two randomized clinical trials, intraoperative opioid dosing based on the nociception level-index produced less pain compared to standard care with a difference in pain scores in the post-anesthesia care unit of 1.5 (95% CI 0.8-2.2) points on an 11-point scale. The proportion of patients with severe pain was lower by 70%. Severe postoperative pain remains a significant problem and associates with several adverse outcomes. Here, we determined whether the application of a monitor that detects intraoperative nociceptive events, based on machine learning technology, and treatment of such events reduces pain scores in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). To that end, we performed a pooled analysis of two trials in adult patients, undergoing elective major abdominal surgery, on the effect of intraoperative nociception level monitor (NOL)-guided fentanyl dosing on PACU pain was performed. Patients received NOL-guided fentanyl dosing or standard care (fentanyl dosing based on hemodynamic parameters). Goal of the intervention was to keep NOL at values that indicated absence of nociception. The primary endpoint of the study was the median pain score obtained in the first 90 min in the PACU. Pain scores were collected at 15 min intervals on an 11-point Likert scale. Data from 125 patients (55 men, 70 women, age range 21-86 years) were analyzed. Sixty-one patients received NOL-guided fentanyl dosing and 64 standard care. Median PACU pain score was 1.5 points (0.8-2.2) lower in the NOL group compared to the standard care; the proportion of patients with severe pain was 70% lower in the NOL group (p = 0.045). The only significant factor associated with increased odds for severe pain was the standard of care compared to NOL treatment (OR 6.0, 95% CI 1.4 -25.9, p = 0.017). The use of a machine learning-based technology to guide opioid dosing during major abdominal surgery resulted in reduced PACU pain scores with less patients in severe pain.

TI  - Prediction of Post-Intubation Tachycardia Using Machine-Learning Models
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Tachycardia is defined as a heart rate greater than 100 bpm for more than 1 min. Tachycardia often occurs after endotracheal intubation and can cause serious complication in patients with cardiovascular disease. The ability to predict post-intubation tachycardia would help clinicians by notifying a potential event to pre-treat. In this paper, we predict the potential post-intubation tachycardia. Given electronic medical record and vital signs collected before tracheal intubation, we predict whether post-intubation tachycardia will occur within 10 min. Of 1931 available patient datasets, 257 remained after filtering those with inappropriate data such as outliers and inappropriate annotations. Three feature sets were designed using feature selection algorithms, and two additional feature sets were defined by statistical inspection or manual examination. The five feature sets were compared with various machine learning models such as naive Bayes classifiers, logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, extreme gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks. Parameters of the models were optimized for each feature set. By 10-fold cross validation, we found that an logistic regression model with eight-dimensional hand-crafted features achieved an accuracy of 80.5%, recall of 85.1%, precision of 79.9%, an F1 score of 79.9%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85.

TI  - Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Prediction: Machine Learning Insights from a Comprehensive Analysis of Perioperative Data
T2  - BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common complications after surgery. This study aimed to present the utilization of machine learning for predicting PONV and provide insights based on a large amount of data. This retrospective study included data on perioperative features of patients, such as patient characteristics and perioperative factors, from two hospitals. Logistic regression algorithms, random forest, light-gradient boosting machines, and multilayer perceptrons were used as machine learning algorithms to develop the models. The dataset of this study included 106,860 adult patients, with an overall incidence rate of 14.4% for PONV. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the models was 0.60-0.67. In the prediction models that included only the known risk and mitigating factors of PONV, the AUROC of the models was 0.54-0.69. Some features were found to be associated with patient-controlled analgesia, with opioids being the most important feature in almost all models. In conclusion, machine learning provides valuable insights into PONV prediction, the selection of significant features for prediction, and feature engineering.

TI  - Recent Trends and Hotspots in Hip Arthroplasty: A Bibliometric Analysis and Visualization Study of Last Five-Year Publications
T2  - ARCHIVES OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-ABJS
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Bibliometric analysis is one of the most prevalent methods for analyzing and predicting research trends of particular subjects. Through a bibliometric analysis, the present study sought to look into and depict the hotspots and research trends in hip arthroplasty research over the previous five years. Methods: The Web of Science Core Collection database was used to find studies on hip arthroplasty published between 2018 and 2022. The VOS viewer, Cite Space, and Bibliometrix were used to carry out the bibliometric study and network visualization. Results: During the last five years, 5,708 hip arthroplasty publications were cited 40,765 times. The United States and the Journal of Arthroplasty were the top countries and journals regarding the number of studies, respectively. The top 10 global high-impact documents were determined using the citation ranking and citation burst. The most frequently referenced research revealed the epidemiological aspects of hip arthroplasty, perioperative care after hip arthroplasty, COVID-19, periprosthetic joint infections, opioid medicines, stability, and osteonecrosis were the hot topics in hip arthroplasty research. Keyword burst analysis showed that the research trends in hip arthroplasty through 2022 were patient-reported outcome measures (PROM), depression, racial disparity, and artificial intelligence (AI). The analysis of the subject areas revealed the close connections and relationships between different subject areas, as demonstrated by the figures. Conclusion: The hip arthroplasty research community is very productive and highly centralized. Periprosthetic joint infection, dual-mobility cups, spinopelvic mobility, direct anterior approach, outpatient total hip arthroplasty, polyethylene, periprosthetic fracture, acetabular defects, tranexamic acid, developmental dysplasia of the hip, and safety-net hospitals were recent trends in hip arthroplasty research. Patient-reported outcome measures, depression, racial disparities, and AI were research hotspots in hip arthroplasty.

TI  - Identification of Anesthetic-Induced Cardiovascular Biomarkers in Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery Using Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis and Machine Learning
T2  - HEART SURGERY FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study aimed to select anesthesia-induced zinc finger protein-related gene biomarkers that predict cardiovascular function during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG). Methods: Gene expression data from GSE4386 included 20 post-anesthesia and 20 pre-anesthesia atrial tissue samples. Zinc finger protein-related genes (ZFPRGs) were searched in the UniProt database and anesthesia-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to screen hub genes, and three machine learning algorithms were used to further screen for cardiovascular biomarkers. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using a nomogram model. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to analyze the pathways enriched by the biomarkers. A microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA-transcription factor (TF) regulatory network was established to explore the potential regulatory mechanisms of these biomarkers. Disease-related drugs were predicted using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). Results: A total of 1102 cardioprotection-related DEGs were selected between the pre- and post-anesthesia groups. Additionally, 1095 hub genes were obtained based on WGCNA, and 2274 ZFPRGs were downloaded from the UniProt database. After Venn analysis and machine learning, ZNF420, RNF135, and BNC2 were selected as cardioprotection-related zinc finger biomarkers during OPCABG. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and nomogram models confirmed the diagnostic value and accuracy of the three cardioprotective biomarkers. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that ZNF420 is involved in the cell cycle and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. RNF135 and BNC2 were enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In the constructed miRNAmRNA-TF network, miR-182-5p and miR-16-5p simultaneously regulated three cardioprotective biomarkers. Conclusion: Three cardioprotection-related zinc finger protein biomarkers (ZNF420, RNF135, and BNC2) were identified using OPCABG samples.

AB  - ABSTRACTSurgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impairrecovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Literaturesuggests significant disparities exist with regard to pain management and its quality-of-life impacts, particularlyamong vulnerable populations (e.g. depressed, obese and diabetics). However, there lacks risk stratificationtools to identify individuals at high risk for these disparate pain outcomes. Although pain scores are routinelycollected in electronic health records (EHRs), shared algorithms to utilize them for care improvement are limited.To advance the efficient and effective use of the abundant amount of electronic data now available, a commondata model (CDM) is necessary: standardized structures, terminologies, and rules to represent EHR data. Usinga CMD for postoperative pain research would facilitate timely evidence generation across multiple populationsand settings, which can provide critical evidence to stakeholders and move the field away from pain treatmentfor the ‘average’ patient to pain treatment for an individual. In this grant, we propose an innovative approach toadvance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain across populations. Our approach will leverage theObservational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to develop tools that use standardize data formatsand naming conventions; OMOP has over 140 collaborating sites gloablly. We will further utilize analytical toolsdeveloped by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) on this CDM to facilitate disseminateacross the research community. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools foradverse pain outcomes across diverse populations. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we willdevelop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperativepain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deeplearning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our modelsexternally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This projectwill deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify patients at high risk foradverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in thecommunity– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic.

TI  - Explainable machine-learning predictions for the prevention of hypoxaemia during surgery
T2  - NATURE BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although anaesthesiologists strive to avoid hypoxaemia during surgery, reliably predicting future intraoperative hypoxaemia is not possible at present. Here, we report the development and testing of a machine-learning-based system that predicts the risk of hypoxaemia and provides explanations of the risk factors in real time during general anaesthesia. The system, which was trained on minute-by-minute data from the electronic medical records of over 50,000 surgeries, improved the performance of anaesthesiologists by providing interpretable hypoxaemia risks and contributing factors. The explanations for the predictions are broadly consistent with the literature and with prior knowledge from anaesthesiologists. Our results suggest that if anaesthesiologists currently anticipate 15% of hypoxaemia events, with the assistance of this system they could anticipate 30%, a large portion of which may benefit from early intervention because they are associated with modifiable factors. The system can help improve the clinical understanding of hypoxaemia risk during anaesthesia care by providing general insights into the exact changes in risk induced by certain characteristics of the patient or procedure.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a method for constructing an anesthesia treatment recommendation model that suggests an optimal treatment among given treatment candidates in response to 17 vital information regarding a patient during surgery. Since the results of the model in the medical field are finally applied to humans, it is crucial to ensure the reliability of the model results. The proposed model replaces the summation with max-pooling to independently calculate the weights for each input feature. Thus, the model can be trained using gradient descent and can provide a basis for the recommended results. We show the possibility through preliminary experiments using data from Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, and apply the method to the additional collected structured data to confirm its effectiveness.

We will further utilize analytical toolsdeveloped by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) on this CDM to facilitate disseminateacross the research community. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools foradverse pain outcomes across diverse populations. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we willdevelop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperativepain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deeplearning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our modelsexternally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This projectwill deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify patients at high risk foradverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in thecommunity– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic.

TI  - Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - AbstractSeventy percent of American adults are overweight or obese, presenting an unprecedented challenge to thenation’s health systems. Effective behavioral programs exist, but these programs are intensive, long-term andrequire highly-trained clinicians, making them prohibitively expensive and thus limiting disseminability.Approaches to decreasing costs include replacing highly-trained clinicians with paraprofessionals, reducingcontact frequency, and/or automating intervention. However, although these alternative interventions result inconsiderably lower average weight losses, variability of weight loss is high. Specifically, and consistent with aSupportive Accountability Model, a substantial minority of participants in high-intensity interventions receive nobenefit, while a subset of those receiving low-intensity interventions achieve clinically significant weight loss.An ideal weight loss treatment system would enhance outcomes and reduce costs by matching eachparticipant to the intervention he/she needs, thus adapting to participants’ needs and conserving resourceswhere they are not needed. Stepped care represents one such system, but has had mixed success and suffersfrom a number of shortcomings. The innovative artificial intelligence (AI) strategy of reinforcement learning(RL) provides rapidly and repeatedly-varying features of intervention, continuously "learning" which featuresprovide optimal responses for which participants. Our team recently completed a pilot of an AI weight losssystem in which overweight adults received a brief in-person weight loss intervention and then were randomlyassigned to receive 3 months of non-optimized interventions (i.e., 12-minute phone calls) or an optimizedcombination of phone calls, text exchanges, and automated messages, selected based on each participants’response to each intervention as determined by weight and behavioral data. As hypothesized, we achievedequivalent weight losses at a fraction of the time cost. The proposed study would recruit 320 overweight adults,provide 1 month of group-based behavioral weight loss treatment and then randomize participants to eithercontinue to receive group-based behavioral weight loss in a remote format for 11 months (BWL-S) or toreinforcement learning-based treatment (BWL-AI). In line with our Supportive Accountability model, BWL-AIwould vary modality, intensity and counselor skill based on continuously-monitored participant digital data. Theproposed study--the first of its kind--would expand on our pilot in several ways including sample size, duration,and features of intervention selected by the AI system. Aims of this project are to test the hypotheses thatweight loss outcomes in BWL-AI will be equivalent to or better than BWL-S, and that the cost per participantand per kg of lost weight will be less in BWL-AI than in BWL-S. Other include characterizing the AI system (interms of interventions selected), assessing feasibility and acceptability of the refined AI system, evaluatingpsychological and demographic predictors of AI intervention selection and investigating differences betweenresponders and non-responders in how the AI system allocates resources.

AB  - In this paper, we proposed a feature extraction and machine learning method for the classification of ultrasound images obtained from lumbar spine of pregnant patients in the transverse plane. A group of features, including matching values and positions, appearance of black pixels within predefined windows along the midline, are extracted from the ultrasound images using template matching and midline detection. Support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel is utilized to classify the bone images and interspinous images with optimal separation hyperplane. The SVM is trained with 800 images from 20 pregnant subjects and tested with 640 images from a separate set of 16 pregnant patients. A high success rate (97.25% on training set and 95.00% on test set) is achieved with the proposed method. The trained SVM model is further tested on 36 videos collected from 36 pregnant subjects and successfully identified the proper needle insertion site (interspinous region) on all of the cases. Therefore, the proposed method is able to identify the ultrasound images of lumbar spine in an automatic manner, so as to facilitate the anesthetists' work to identify the needle insertion point precisely and effectively.

TI  - Appropriateness and Comprehensiveness of Using ChatGPT for Perioperative Patient Education in Thoracic Surgery in Different Language Contexts: Survey Study
T2  - INTERACTIVE JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - \Background: ChatGPT, a dialogue-based artificial intelligence language model, has shown promise in assisting clinical workflows and patient-clinician communication. However, there is a lack of feasibility assessments regarding its use for perioperative patient education in thoracic surgery.Objective: This study aimed to assess the appropriateness and comprehensiveness of using ChatGPT for perioperative patient education in thoracic surgery in both English and Chinese contexts.Methods: This pilot study was conducted in February 2023. A total of 37 questions focused on perioperative patient education in thoracic surgery were created based on guidelines and clinical experience. Two sets of inquiries were made to ChatGPT for each question, one in English and the other in Chinese. The responses generated by ChatGPT were evaluated separately by experienced thoracic surgical clinicians for appropriateness and comprehensiveness based on a hypothetical draft response to a patient's question on the electronic information platform. For a response to be qualified, it required at least 80% of reviewers to deem it appropriate and 50% to deem it comprehensive. Statistical analyses were performed using the unpaired chi-square test or Fisher exact test, with a significance level set at P<.05.Results: The set of 37 commonly asked questions covered topics such as disease information, diagnostic procedures, perioperative complications, treatment measures, disease prevention, and perioperative care considerations. In both the English and Chinese contexts, 34 (92%) out of 37 responses were qualified in terms of both appropriateness and comprehensiveness. The remaining 3 (8%) responses were unqualified in these 2 contexts. The unqualified responses primarily involved the diagnosis of disease symptoms and surgical-related complications symptoms. The reasons for determining the responses as unqualified were similar in both contexts. There was no statistically significant difference (34/37, 92% vs 34/37, 92%; P=.99) in the qualification rate between the 2 language sets.Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates the potential feasibility of using ChatGPT for perioperative patient education in thoracic surgery in both English and Chinese contexts. ChatGPT is expected to enhance patient satisfaction, reduce anxiety, and improve compliance during the perioperative period. In the future, there will be remarkable potential application for using artificial intelligence, in conjunction with human review, for patient education and health consultation after patients have provided their informed consent.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Based CT Images in Analysis of Postoperative Recovery of Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy under Balanced Anesthesia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore whether preoperative processing can promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) surgery, in the study, an artificial intelligence-based algorithm was used to segment the CT images to assist doctors in decision making. The patients were divided into observation group (balanced anesthesia) and control group (general anesthesia) with SPSS. The observation group received balanced anesthesia half a day before the operation. The method of balanced anesthesia was to induce 0.2 mg/kg midazolam, 3 mg/kg propofol, 2 mu g/kg remifentanil, 0.2 mg/kg vecuronium, 4 similar to 5 mg/(kg.h) propofol, and 9 similar to 11 mu g/(kg.h) remifentanil continuous intravenous infusion to maintain anesthesia, and it was stopped once the patient defecated; the control group had general anesthesia in the afternoon after the operation, and it was stopped once the patient defecated. The time before the first exhaust and defecation after the surgery as well as the recovery time of bowel sound was recorded, and the degree of abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and gastrointestinal adverse reactions was evaluated at 22 hours, 46 hours, and 70 hours after the surgery. It was found that the accuracy of the artificial intelligence-based segmentation algorithm was 81%. The reconstruction accuracy of multidimensional liver could be observed at any angle, and the reconstruction accuracy was not lower than the resolution of original input CT. The calculation error was less than 9%, and the volume of whole liver, liver segment, preresection liver, and residual liver was less than 9%. The simulation accuracy of virtual liver surgery was not lower than the resolution of original input CT. The time before the first exhaust and defecation was shorter in the observation group versus the control group (P < 0.05). The recovery time of bowel sound in the observation group was shorter than that in the control group (P < 0.05). There was a significant difference in the scores of abdominal distension between the two groups at 22 h and 46 h after surgery (P < 0.05). It suggested that both the observation group and the control group could improve the symptoms of gastrointestinal adverse reactions after surgery. Nevertheless, balanced anesthesia can shorten the time before the first exhaust and defecation after surgery and promote the recovery of postoperative bowel sound. Furthermore, balanced anesthesia can alleviate abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal adverse reactions, which should be promoted in clinic.

TI  - A prediction model using machine-learning algorithm for assessing intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine dose during cesarean section
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine dosage for cesarean section is difficult to predetermine. This study aimed to develop a decision-support model using a machine-learning algorithm for assessing intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine dose based on physical variables during cesarean section. Methods Term parturients presenting for elective cesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were enrolled. Spinal anesthesia was performed at the L3/4 interspace with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine at dosages determined by the anesthesiologist. A spinal spread level between T4-T6 was considered the appropriate block level. We used a machine-learning algorithm to identify relevant parameters. The dataset was split into derivation (80%) and validation (20%) cohorts. A decision-support model was developed for obtaining the regression equation between optimized intrathecal 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine volume and physical variables. Results A total of 684 parturients were included, of whom 516 (75.44%) and 168 (24.56%) had block levels between T4 and T6, and less than T6 or higher than T4, respectively. The appropriate block level rate was 75.44%, with the mean bupivacaine volume [1.965, 95%CI (1.945,1.984)]ml. In lasso regression, based on the principle of predicting a reasonable dose of intrathecal bupivacaine with fewer physical variables, the model is "Y=0.5922+ 0.055117* X-1-0.017599*X-2" (Y: bupivacaine volume; X-1: vertebral column length; X-2: abdominal girth), with lambda 0.055, MSE 0.0087, and R-2 0.807. Conclusions After applying a machine-learning algorithm, we developed a decision model with R-2 0.8070 and MSE due to error 0.0087 using abdominal girth and vertebral column length for predicting the optimized intrathecal 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine dosage during term cesarean sections.

AB  - Project Summary/AbstractCurrent clinical practice of anesthesiology involves administering anesthetics using standard dosingguidelines, monitoring physiological responses during administration, and adjusting the dosedepending on the patient responses. Importantly, direct monitoring of the brain is not part of standardanesthesiology practice, despite the desired effect taking place in the brain. In cases where the brainis directly monitored, proprietary, drug-independent, non-personalized depth of unconsciousnessindices are commonly used to infer conscious state from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Thismay result in overdosing, as there are significant inter-individual differences in neurological responseto identical doses of anesthetics and signatures of anesthesia vary significantly with age or with choiceof anesthetic. Consequently, older patients are often given more anesthetic than necessary and are athigh risk for developing post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and delirium, which may last upto several months. The prevalence of surgical procedures on older patients will rise as the populationages, necessitating new approaches for ensuring safe, personalized delivery of anesthetics thatensure unconsciousness, but also safety and return to normal cognitive function following surgery.This project seeks to develop closed-loop control of general anesthesia in humans as a means ofpersonalizing anesthesia care. Aim 1 of this project seeks to use machine learning to develop a drug-specific marker of depth of unconsciousness that reflects the varying signatures of unconsciousnesswith age and may be understood clinically in terms of brain function. Aim 2 of this project is to developmodels and nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithms for regulating depth ofunconsciousness during general anesthesia. MPC is a control scheme that may be easily modified toincorporate clinical safety features and has been used extensively in medical control systems. Totightly regulate depth of unconsciousness, fast actuation by the anesthetic is critical. Aim 3 of thisproject seeks to characterize the effect of propanidid, a fast-acting anesthetic currently used in clinicalpractice in Mexico. The culmination of Aim 2 will result in designing clinical trials for the first closed-loop anesthetic control and the culmination of Aim 3 will result in designing a clinical pharmacokineticstudy of propanidid. The results of this project have the potential to transform clinical practice ofanesthesia and allow individualized anesthesia care. By direct EEG monitoring and control of brainstate rather than secondary markers, the personalized treatment developed by this project should helpreduce overdosing of senior surgical patients and reduce incidence of POCD and delirium.

AB  - An electroencephalograph (EEG) based classification processor for the depth of Anesthesia (DoA) during the intraoperative procedure is presented. To enable a DoA to monitor the correct estimation across a range of patients, a novel feature extraction along with machine learning processor is utilized. The decisions are solely based on seven features extracted from EEG along with the EMG signal for motion artifacts rejection. To extract the features efficiently on hardware, a 128-point FFT is proposed that achieves an area reduction and energy/FFT-operation by 39% and 58%, respectively, compared to the conventional. A simple decision tree is used to perform a multiclass DoA classification. The system is synthesized using a 65nm process and experimental verification is done using FPGA based on the subset of patients from the University of Queensland Vital Signs. The proposed patient-specific DoA classification processor achieves a classification accuracy of 79%.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Hyperglycemia or high blood glucose during surgery is associated with poor postoperative outcome. Knowing in advance which patients may develop hyperglycemia allows optimal assignment of resources and earlier initiation of glucose management plan. Objective To develop predictive models to estimate peak glucose levels in surgical patients and to implement the best performing model as a point-of-care clinical tool to assist the surgical team to optimally manage glucose levels. Methods Using a large perioperative dataset (6,579 patients) of patient- and surgery-specific parameters, we developed and validated linear regression and machine learning models (random forest, extreme gradient boosting [Xg Boost], classification and regression trees [CART], and neural network) to predict the peak glucose levels during surgery. The model performances were compared in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), logarithm of the ratio of the predicted to actual value (log ratio), median prediction error, and interquartile error range. The best performing model was implemented as part of a web-based application for optimal decision-making toward glucose management during surgery. Results Accuracy of the machine learning models were higher (MAPE = 17%, log ratio = 0.029 for Xg Boost) when compared with that of the linear regression model (MAPE = 22%, log ratio = 0.041). The Xg Boost model had the smallest median prediction error (5.4 mg/dL) and the narrowest interquartile error range (-17 to 24 mg/dL) as compared with the other models. The best performing model, Xg Boost, was implemented as a web application, Hyper-G, which the perioperative providers can use at the point of care to estimate peak glucose levels during surgery. Conclusions Machine learning models are able to accurately predict peak glucose levels during surgery. Implementation of such a model as a web-based application can facilitate optimal decision-making and advance planning of glucose management strategies.

M3  - Article
AB  - Brain cancer is a disease caused by the growth of abnormal aggressive cells in the brain outside of normal cells. Symptoms and diagnosis of brain cancer cases are producing more accurate results day by day in parallel with the development of technological opportunities. In this study, a deep learning model called BrainMRNet which is developed for mass detection in open-source brain magnetic resonance images was used. The BrainMRNet model includes three processing steps: attention modules, the hypercolumn technique, and residual blocks. To demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model, three types of tumor data leading to brain cancer were examined in this study: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary. In addition, a segmentation method was proposed, which additionally determines in which lobe area of the brain the two classes of tumors that cause brain cancer are more concentrated. The classification accuracy rates were performed in the study; it was 98.18% in glioma tumor, 96.73% in meningioma tumor, and 98.18% in pituitary tumor. At the end of the experiment, using the subset of glioma and meningioma tumor images, it was determined which at brain lobe the tumor region was seen, and 100% success was achieved in the analysis of this determination. In this study, a hybrid deep learning model is presented to determine the detection of the brain tumor. In addition, open-source software was proposed, which statistically found in which lobe region of the human brain the brain tumor occurred. The methods applied and tested in the experiments have shown promising results with a high level of accuracy, precision, and specificity. These results demonstrate the availability of the proposed approach in clinical settings to support the medical decision regarding brain tumor detection.

TI  - Blood pressure monitoring during anesthesia induction using PPG morphology features and machine learning
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Blood pressure (BP) is a crucial biomarker giving valuable information regarding cardiovascular diseases but requires accurate continuous monitoring to maximize its value. In the effort of developing non-invasive, non-occlusive and continuous BP monitoring devices, photoplethysmography (PPG) has recently gained interest. Researchers have attempted to estimate BP based on the analysis of PPG waveform morphology, with promising results, yet often validated on a small number of subjects with moderate BP variations. This work presents an accurate BP estimator based on PPG morphology features. The method first uses a clinically-validated algorithm (oBPM((R))) to perform signal preprocessing and extraction of physiological features. A subset of features that best reflects BP changes is automatically identified by Lasso regression, and a feature relevance analysis is conducted. Three machine learning (ML) methods are then investigated to translate this subset of features into systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimates; namely Lasso regression, support vector regression and Gaussian process regression. The accuracy of absolute BP estimates and trending ability are evaluated. Such an approach considerably improves the performance for SBP estimation over previous oBPM((R)) technology, with a reduction in the standard deviation of the error of over 20%. Furthermore, rapid BP changes assessed by the PPG-based approach demonstrates concordance rate over 99% with the invasive reference. Altogether, the results confirm that PPG morphology features can be combined with ML methods to accurately track BP variations generated during anesthesia induction. They also reinforce the importance of adding a calibration measure to obtain an absolute BP estimate.

TI  - Prediction of Bispectral Index during Target-controlled Infusion of Propofol and Remifentanil <i>A Deep Learning Approach</i>
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The discrepancy between predicted effect-site concentration and measured bispectral index is problematic during intravenous anesthesia with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. We hypothesized that bispectral index during total intravenous anesthesia would be more accurately predicted by a deep learning approach.Methods: Long short-term memory and the feed-forward neural network were sequenced to simulate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parts of an empirical model, respectively, to predict intraoperative bispectral index during combined use of propofol and remifentanil. Inputs of long short-term memory were infusion histories of propofol and remifentanil, which were retrieved from target-controlled infusion pumps for 1,800 s at 10-s intervals. Inputs of the feed-forward network were the outputs of long short-term memory and demographic data such as age, sex, weight, and height. The final output of the feed-forward network was the bispectral index. The performance of bispectral index prediction was compared between the deep learning model and previously reported response surface model.Results: The model hyperparameters comprised 8 memory cells in the long short-term memory layer and 16 nodes in the hidden layer of the feed-forward network. The model training and testing were performed with separate data sets of 131 and 100 cases. The concordance correlation coefficient (95% CI) were 0.561 (0.560 to 0.562) in the deep learning model, which was significantly larger than that in the response surface model (0.265 [0.263 to 0.266], P < 0.001).Conclusions: The deep learning model-predicted bispectral index during target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil more accurately compared to the traditional model. The deep learning approach in anesthetic pharmacology seems promising because of its excellent performance and extensibility.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Delayed recovery from general anesthesia is a well-known complication that requires predictive tools and approaches. This study aimed to determine significant factors associated with postanesthesia recovery and to develop an algorithm for estimating recovery time from general anesthesia. Materials & methods: The genotypes of patients were determined by SNaPshot or ARMS-qPCR. The algorithm was developed via machine-learning and tested by the worm plot. Results: Results showed that OPRM1 rs1799971 (p =0.006) and ABCG2 rs2231142 (p =0.041) were significantly associated with recovery time. Ten factors after random forest and stepwise selection were associated with recovery time. Ten factors after random forest and stepwise selection were associated with recovery time. Meanwhile, seven factors were associated with delayed recovery. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that both clinical and pharmacogenetic data are significantly associated with recovery from general anesthesia and provide the basis for pre-emptive prediction tools.

TI  - Continuous Blood Pressure Monitoring in Patients Having Surgery: A Narrative Review
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Hypotension can occur before, during, and after surgery and is associated with postoperative complications. Anesthesiologists should thus avoid profound and prolonged hypotension. A crucial part of avoiding hypotension is accurate and tight blood pressure monitoring. In this narrative review, we briefly describe methods for continuous blood pressure monitoring, discuss current evidence for continuous blood pressure monitoring in patients having surgery to reduce perioperative hypotension, and expand on future directions and innovations in this field. In summary, continuous blood pressure monitoring with arterial catheters or noninvasive sensors enables clinicians to detect and treat hypotension immediately. Furthermore, advanced hemodynamic monitoring technologies and artificial intelligence-in combination with continuous blood pressure monitoring-may help clinicians identify underlying causes of hypotension or even predict hypotension before it occurs.

TI  - Edge artificial intelligence wireless video capsule endoscopy
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, including colorectal cancer, which has shown a rising incidence among adults younger than 50. Although this could be alleviated by regular screening, only a small percentage of those at risk are screened comprehensively, due to shortcomings in accuracy and patient acceptance. To address these challenges, we designed an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered wireless video endoscopic capsule that surpasses the performance of the existing solutions by featuring, among others: (1) real-time image processing using onboard deep neural networks (DNN), (2) enhanced visualization of the mucous layer by deploying both white-light and narrow-band imaging, (3) on-the-go task modification and DNN update using over-the-air-programming and (4) bi-directional communication with patient's personal electronic devices to report important findings. We tested our solution in an in vivo setting, by administrating our endoscopic capsule to a pig under general anesthesia. All novel features, successfully implemented on a single platform, were validated. Our study lays the groundwork for clinically implementing a new generation of endoscopic capsules, which will significantly improve early diagnosis of upper and lower GI tract diseases.

TI  - Children's Pain Identification Based on Skin Potential Signal
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pain management is a crucial concern in medicine, particularly in the case of children who may struggle to effectively communicate their pain. Despite the longstanding reliance on various assessment scales by medical professionals, these tools have shown limitations and subjectivity. In this paper, we present a pain assessment scheme based on skin potential signals, aiming to convert subjective pain into objective indicators for pain identification using machine learning methods. We have designed and implemented a portable non-invasive measurement device to measure skin potential signals and conducted experiments involving 623 subjects. From the experimental data, we selected 358 valid records, which were then divided into 218 silent samples and 262 pain samples. A total of 38 features were extracted from each sample, with seven features displaying superior performance in pain identification. Employing three classification algorithms, we found that the random forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 70.63%. While this identification rate shows promise for clinical applications, it is important to note that our results differ from state-of-the-art research, which achieved a recognition rate of 81.5%. This discrepancy arises from the fact that our pain stimuli were induced by clinical operations, making it challenging to precisely control the stimulus intensity when compared to electrical or thermal stimuli. Despite this limitation, our pain assessment scheme demonstrates significant potential in providing objective pain identification in clinical settings. Further research and refinement of the proposed approach may lead to even more accurate and reliable pain management techniques in the future.

T2  - PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pain management is gaining the attention of clinical practitioners to relieve patients from pain in an effective manner. Pain management is primarily dependent on pain measurement. Researchers have proposed various techniques to measure pain from facial expressions improving the accuracy and efficiency of the traditional pain measurement such as self-reporting and visual analog scale. Developments in the field of deep learning have further enhanced the pain assessment technique. Despite of the state of the art performance of deep learning algorithms, adaptation to new subjects is still a problem due to availability of a few samples of the same. Authors have addressed this issue by employing a model agnostic meta-learning algorithm for pain detection and fast adaptation of the trained algorithm for new subjects using only a few labeled images. The model is pre-trained with labeled images of subjects with five pain levels to acquire meta-knowledge in the presented work. This meta-knowledge is then used to adapt the model to a new learning task in the form of a new subject. The proposed model is evaluated on a benchmark dataset, i.e., UNBC McMaster pain archive database. Experimental results show that the model can be very easily adapted to new subjects with the accuracy of 96% and 98% for 1-shot and 5-shot learning respectively, proving the potential of the proposed algorithm for clinical use.

AB  - Undergoing an MRI scan can be a stressful experience for young children. For this reason, pediatric patients are often scanned under general anesthesia or sedation, which is costly and may carry health risks. By preparing children for their scan, anesthesia may be avoided; however, existing preparation solutions are generally hospital-specific and not easily scalable. We describe the iterative design process and feasibility test of the Scan Buddy app: a scalable app to prepare children 4-10 for an MRI scan.Interviews and Questionnaire: Interviews with 19 healthcare practitioners (US and EU) revealed a desire to reduce anesthesia for imaging through better patient preparation. A questionnaire administered to 73 caregivers of children who recently had an MRI scan exposed the need for well-designed tools to explain the MRI procedure as well as caregivers' willingness to invest time in at-home preparation if it could increase the likelihood of an awake scan.Design Rationale: We developed a learning framework based on Informing, Familiarizing and Training children for MRI (FIT-for-MRI), and designed a gamified app with 7 learning goals.Method: Scan Buddy v1 was used in the weeks prior to an MRI examination by 28 children in a feasibility test at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.Results: Scan Buddy prepared the children for their MRI: learning goals were met, children enjoyed playing with the app, awake scanning was successful, and parents felt it supported their child in their preparation. Scan Buddy v2 was subsequently developed, and the rationale for design is detailed.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Predicts Cost After Ambulatory Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
T2  - Arthroscopy, sports medicine, and rehabilitation
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and internally validate a machine-learning algorithm to reliably predict cost after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).METHODS: A retrospective review of the New York State Ambulatory Surgery and Services database was performed to identify patients who underwent elective ACLR from 2015 to 2016. Features included in initial models consisted of patient characteristics (age, sex, insurance status, income, medical comorbidities as classified by the Clinical Classifications Software diagnosis code) as well as intraoperative variables (type of anesthesia and procedure-specific factors). Models were generated to predict total charges using 4 algorithms: random forest, extreme gradient boost, elastic net penalized regression, and support vector machines with radial kernels. Training was performed with 10-fold cross-validation followed by internal validation via 0.632 bootstrapping. Model discriminative performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration, and the Brier score. Decision curve analysis was performed to demonstrate the net benefit of using the final model in practice.RESULTS: In total, 7,311 patients undergoing ambulatory ACLR were included. The random forest model demonstrated the best performance assessed via internal validation (area under the curve= 0.85), calibration, and the Brier score (0.208). Cost incurred was influenced by anesthesia type, operating room time, and number of chronic comorbidities. Decision curve analysis revealed a net benefit for use of the random forest model and the model was integrated into a web-based open-access application.CONCLUSIONS: The random forest model predicted cost after ambulatory ACLR using a large, statewide database with good performance. The top variables found to predict increased charges were general anesthesia, operating room time, meniscal repair, self-pay insurance, patient neighborhood characteristics, and number of chronic conditions.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, retrospective cohort study.

AB  - ABSTRACTTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and patients with moderate-severetraumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Patients with TBI who havesurgery have poor outcomes, attributed to a high (>50%) prevalence of perioperative second insults such ashypotension and hypocarbia, which reduce cerebral perfusion and cause cerebral ischemia. Anesthesiologistsprovide analgesia, sedation, immobility, and amnesia, and aim to confer physiological stability, expectedpatient response, real-time physiological data, and professional judgement but are unfortunately unable toaccurately predict in real time which patients with TBI will have hypotension and hypocarbia. Yet, avoidance ofthese second insults increases discharge survival among patients with TBI. Predicting and preventinghypotension and hypocarbia during TBI care is, therefore, vital, and avoidance of hypotension and hypocarbiaare key performance indicators for perioperative TBI care. Small data science studies suggest that machinelearning (ML) techniques can model and predict TBI pathophysiology and help reduce unwanted secondinsults after TBI. The project goal is to use ML methods to prevent second insults (hypotension andhypocarbia) during urgent/emergent perioperative TBI care. In response to PA-16-161, we propose 2 SpecificAims: 1) To construct and identify the TBI physiological ML model that most accurately predictsperioperative hypotension and hypocarbia, and 2) To develop ML derived personalized prescriptionsfor prevention of perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia. This project is innovative and will beimpactful because the approach is grounded in strong data science, and acute care, and implementationscience frameworks, because it develops ML derived prescriptions to prevent hypotension and hypocarbia,and because we use ML solutions to improve care quality and outcomes after TBI.

TI  - Machine learning based method for the evaluation of the Analgesia Nociception Index in the assessment of general anesthesia
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring the level of analgesia to adapt the opioids infusion during anesthesia to the real needs of the patient is still a challenge. This is a consequence of the absence of a specific measure capable of quantifying the nociception level of the patients. Unlike existing proposals, this paper aims to evaluate the suitability of the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) as a guidance variable to replicate the decisions made by the experts when a modification of the opioid infusion rate is required. To this end, different machine learning classifiers were trained with several sets of clinical features. Data for training were captured from 17 patients undergoing cholecystectomy surgery. Satisfactory results were obtained when including information about minimum values of ANI for predicting a change of dose. Specifically, a higher efficiency of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was observed compared with the situation in which the ANI index was not included: accuracy: 86.21% (83.62%87.93%), precision: 86.11% (83.78%-88.57%), recall: 91.18% (88.24%-91.18%), specificity: 79.17% (75%83.33%), AUC: 0.89 (0.87-0.90) and kappa index: 0.71 (0.66-0.75). The results of this research evidenced that including information about the minimum values of ANI together with the hemodynamic information outperformed the decisions made regarding only non-specific traditional signs such as heart rate and blood pressure. In addition, the analysis of the results showed that including the ANI monitor in the decision making process may anticipate a dose change to prevent hemodynamic events. Finally, the SVM was able to perform accurate predictions when making different decisions commonly observed in the clinical practice.

AB  - We developed an objective real-time pain detection method using a smartphone and a wrist-worn wearable device to collect electrodermal activity (EDA) signals. Recently, various researchers have developed pain management applications. However, they rely on subjective self-reported pain scores or the video camera of a smartphone to detect pain, but the latter method's accuracy needs further improvement. In our work, we use a wrist-worn EDA device which transmits data via Bluetooth to a smartphone. A smartphone application was developed to analyze the EDA data so that near real-time processed pain detection information can be displayed. The analysis of EDA is based on estimating time-varying spectral power in the frequency range (0.08-0.24 Hz) associated with the sympathetic nervous system. This time-varying characterization of EDA is termed TVSymp. In this work, we also examined whether removing baseline EDA fluctuations from TVSymp would provide more accurate results. This was carried out by taking the moving average of the EDA response prior to stimulus and subtracting that value from the EDA response post stimulus. This approach is termed modified TVSymp (MTVSymp). Pain stimuli were induced in ten subjects using a thermal grill, which gives intense pain perception without damaging skin tissues. We compared both TVSymp and MTVSymp in detecting pain induced by the thermal grill using machine learning approaches. We found the accuracy of pain detection of TVSymp and MTVSymp to be 80% and 90%, respectively.

TI  - Predictive Analysis of Hypotension after Spinal Anesthesia During Cesarean Section: A Machine Learning-based Study
T2  - Acta Medicinae Universitatis Scientiae et Technologiae Huazhong
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To construct and verify the prediction models of hypotension after spinal anesthesia during cesarean section.Methods All patients undergoing spinal anesthesia from April 1st of 2014to May 1st of 2018were collected retrospectively, of which 3100cases met the inclusion criteria.After data pre-processing,the important features of the populations were selected through Lasso regression cross validation.Using these features and the vital sign vectors with intraoperative time series feature,5machine learning models were constructed:Logistic regression model,support vector machine model,random forest model,artificial neural network and Xgboost model.The predictive accuracy was assessed by using the ROC curve and the area under the curve(AUC).In order to find the best model,the importance of each feature in this model was explored.Ten-fold cross-validation was conducted in the best model in order to explore the universality and stability of the model.Results Out of 2113cases,1005(47.56%)experienced hypotension after spinal anesthesia.Twenty-three features of machine learning were selected by using Lasso regression cross-validation.The AUC values of logistic regression model,support vector machine model, random forest model and Xgboost model were 0.751(95%CI,0.721to 0.780),0.797(95%CI,0.770to 0.824),0.764(95% CI,0.735to 0.792),0.734(95%CI,0.704to 0.764)and 0.801(95%CI,0.775to 0.827),respectively.The Xgboost model had the best prediction ability.According to the importance of each feature in the model,continuous variables(including vital signs before anesthesia,age and height)and categorical variables(including ondansetron,magnesium sulfate,ASA classification, local anesthetics,twin pregnancy,preeclampsia and diabetes)were found to be closely related to the occurrence of hypotension after spinal anesthesia.Through ten-fold cross-validation,Xgboost model showed good universality and stability.Conclusion Xgboost model is constructed by using a variety of data,which has satisfying prediction performance and clinical value.

TI  - Smart Portable Pen for Continuous Monitoring of Anaesthetics in Human Serum With Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of anaesthetics infusion is demanded by anaesthesiologists to help in defining personalized dose, hence reducing risks and side effects. We propose the first piece of technology tailored explicitly to close the loop between anaesthesiologist and patient with continuous drug monitoring. Direct detection of drugs is achieved with electrochemical techniques, and several options are present in literature to measure propofol (widely used anaesthetics). Still, the sensors proposed do not enable in-situ detection, they do not provide this information continuously, and they are based on bulky and costly lab equipment. In this paper, we present a novel smart pen-shaped electronic system for continuous monitoring of propofol in human serum. The system consists of a needle-shaped sensor, a quasi digital front-end, a smart machine learning data processing, in a single wireless battery-operated embedded device featuring Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. The system has been tested and characterized in real, undiluted human serum, at 37 degrees C. The device features a limit of detection of 3.8 mu M, meeting the requirement of the target application, with an electronics system 59% smaller and 81% less power consuming w.r.t. the state-of-the-art, using a smart machine learning classification for data processing, which guarantees up to twenty continuous measure.

TI  - Machine learning approach to predict postoperative opioid requirements in ambulatory surgery patients
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Opioids play a critical role in acute postoperative pain management. Our objective was to develop machine learning models to predict postoperative opioid requirements in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. To develop the models, we used a perioperative dataset of 13,700 patients (>= 18 years) undergoing ambulatory surgery between the years 2016-2018. The data, comprising of patient, procedure and provider factors that could influence postoperative pain and opioid requirements, was randomly split into training (80%) and validation (20%) datasets. Machine learning models of different classes were developed to predict categorized levels of postoperative opioid requirements using the training dataset and then evaluated on the validation dataset. Prediction accuracy was used to differentiate model performances. The five types of models that were developed returned the following accuracies at two different stages of surgery: 1) Prior to surgery-Multinomial Logistic Regression: 71%, Naive Bayes: 67%, Neural Network: 30%, Random Forest: 72%, Extreme Gradient Boost: 71% and 2) End of surgery-Multinomial Logistic Regression: 71%, Naive Bayes: 63%, Neural Network: 32%, Random Forest: 72%, Extreme Gradient Boost: 70%. Analyzing the sensitivities of the best performing Random Forest model showed that the lower opioid requirements are predicted with better accuracy (89%) as compared with higher opioid requirements (43%). Feature importance (% relative importance) of model predictions showed that the type of procedure (15.4%), medical history (12.9%) and procedure duration (12.0%) were the top three features contributing to model predictions. Overall, the contribution of patient and procedure features towards model predictions were 65% and 35% respectively. Machine learning models could be used to predict postoperative opioid requirements in ambulatory surgery patients and could potentially assist in better management of their postoperative acute pain.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Identification of Cardiomyopathy Risk in Childhood Cancer Survivors
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTTreatment-related cardiomyopathy/heart failure (CHF) is a leading cause of premature morbidity in childhoodcancer survivors. Given the widespread use of anthracycline and related cardiotoxic chemotherapeutics, and incombination with radiotherapy exposure to the chest, over half of long-term survivors of childhood cancer are atsignificantly increased risk of early CHF compared with an age-matched general population. Currently, nationaland international consensus guidelines recommend the routine use of 2-dimensional (2D) echocardiography toscreen this high-risk population for early signs of CHF, in particular, left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction andchanges in LV geometry. At present, 2D echocardiography represents the standard of care across the US givenits widespread availability, relatively lower cost, and avoidance of ionizing radiation or sedation. Nevertheless,limitations of 2D echocardiography include greater intra-patient and inter-observer variability. As a result, currentechocardiography-based surveillance continues to have limited sensitivity and often requires serial studiesbefore a patient is identified as having a potential abnormality. Although there is insufficient evidence to guideCHF management specific to pediatric cancer survivors, the evidence for non-cancer-related cardiomyopathy inboth children and adults suggests that earlier intervention can mitigate or delay CHF progression. Therefore,methods that improve the detection of early CHF in childhood cancer survivors may have important clinicalimplications. Deep learning (DL), a subfield of machine learning, can automatically extract patterns from largeunstructured datasets, such as medical images, and is increasingly being utilized in medicine for diseasediagnosis as well as disease onset and outcome prediction. We propose to leverage a unique imaging datasetwe have assembled from the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), a part of the NCI-sponsored National ClinicalTrials Network and Community Oncology Research Program, to explore the potential of DL for enhanceddetection of CHF. We have longitudinal echocardiographic data on over 100 survivors of childhood cancer whodeveloped CHF and over 350 who did not, all defined using standardized criteria, representing an imagingrepository of >3000 individual echocardiograms (and growing). Using this extant and clinically annotated dataset,we propose to: 1) Using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), identify the optimal process for a DL-based assessment of CHF in pediatric cancer survivors; and 2) Assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy ofDCNN-based prediction of cardiomyopathy onset from pre-CHF diagnosis echocardiograms. Expected resultsinclude the development of a DCNN that will differentiate between abnormal and normal echocardiograms frompediatric cancer survivors with and without CHF, respectively. After optimization, we will conduct a preliminaryefficacy analysis to determine how many years in advance a survivor's transition to CHF can be predicted usingan optimized DCNN.

TI  - Machine-Learning Model for the Prediction of Hypoxaemia during Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography under Monitored Anaesthesia Care
T2  - YONSEI MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Hypoxaemia is a significant adverse event during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) under monitored anaesthesia care (MAC); however, no model has been developed to predict hypoxaemia. We aimed to develop and compare logistic regression (LR) and machine learning (ML) models to predict hypoxaemia during ERCP under MAC.Materials and Methods: We collected patient data from our institutional ERCP database. The study population was randomly divided into training and test sets (7:3). Models were fit to training data and evaluated on unseen test data. The training set was further split into k-fold (k=5) for tuning hyperparameters, such as feature selection and early stopping. Models were trained over k loops; the i-th fold was set aside as a validation set in the i-th loop. Model performance was measured using area under the curve (AUC).Results: We identified 6114 cases of ERCP under MAC, with a total hypoxaemia rate of 5.9%. The LR model was established by combining eight variables and had a test AUC of 0.693. The ML and LR models were evaluated on 30 independent data splits. The average test AUC for LR was 0.7230, which improved to 0.7336 by adding eight more variables with an l(1) regularisation-based selection technique and ensembling the LRs and gradient boosting algorithm (GBM). The high-risk group was discriminated using the GBM ensemble model, with a sensitivity and specificity of 63.6% and 72.2%, respectively.Conclusion: We established GBM ensemble model and LR model for risk prediction, which demonstrated good potential for preventing hypoxaemia during ERCP under MAC.

TI  - Predictive model for difficult laryngoscopy using machine learning: retrospective cohort study
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Both predictions and predictors of difficult laryngoscopy are controversial. Machine learning is an excellent alternative method for predicting difficult laryngoscopy. This study aimed to develop and validate practical predictive models for difficult laryngoscopy through machine learning.Methods: Variables for the prediction of difficult laryngoscopy included age, Mallampati grade, body mass index, sternomental distance, and neck circumference. Difficult laryngoscopy was defined as grade 3 and 4 by the Cormack-Lehane classification. Pre-anesthesia and anesthesia data of 616 patients who had undergone anesthesia at a single center were included. The dataset was divided into a base training set (n = 492) and a base test set (n = 124), with equal distribution of difficult laryngoscopy. Training data sets were trained with six algorithms (multilayer perceptron, logistic regression, supportive vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine), and cross-validated. The model with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was chosen as the final model, which was validated with the test set.Results: The results of cross-validation were best using the light gradient boosting machine algorithm with Mallampati score x age and sternomental distance as predictive model parame-ters. The predicted AUROC for the difficult laryngoscopy class was 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.83; p = 0.014), and the recall (sensitivity) was 0.85.Conclusion: Predicting difficult laryngoscopy is possible with three parameters. Severe damage resulting from failure to predict difficult laryngoscopy with high recall is small with the reported model. The model's performance can be further enhanced by additional data training.(c) 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

TI  - Machine Learning Study of the Extended Drug-target Interaction Network informed by Pain Related Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels.
T2  - ArXiv
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Pain is a significant global health issue, and the current treatment options for pain management have limitations in terms of effectiveness, side effects, and potential for addiction. There is a pressing need for improved pain treatments and the development of new drugs. Voltage-gated sodium channels, particularly Nav1.3, Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9, play a crucial role in neuronal excitability and are predominantly expressed in the peripheral nervous system. Targeting these channels may provide a means to treat pain while minimizing central and cardiac adverse effects. In this study, we construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks based on pain-related sodium channels and develop a corresponding drug-target interaction (DTI) network to identify potential lead compounds for pain management. To ensure reliable machine learning predictions, we carefully select 111 inhibitor datasets from a pool of over 1,000 targets in the PPI network. We employ three distinct machine learning algorithms combined with advanced natural language processing (NLP)-based embeddings, specifically pre-trained transformer and autoencoder representations. Through a systematic screening process, we evaluate the side effects and repurposing potential of over 150,000 drug candidates targeting Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 sodium channels. Additionally, we assess the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of these candidates to identify leads with near-optimal characteristics. Our strategy provides an innovative platform for the pharmacological development of pain treatments, offering the potential for improved efficacy and reduced side effects.

AB  - The notion of pain covers a multitude of distinct sensorial experiences that serve as a warning system to the human subject. Pain management is crucial because an untreated or intense pain can subdue the nervous system and the entire emotional universe of the suffering patient. In this paper we propose an automatic pain assistance solution, a visual recognition system for pain intensity estimation that targets patients unable to communicate that they are in pain. We trained from scratch a ResNet model on the BioVid Heat Pain data set, with different selections of hyper-parameters and data augmentation and we evaluated the results. We also analyzed the impact of constraining the test and train data sets with regards to using images of the same subject for both the train and the test sets comparing with the scenario where the images of a subject are used solely for testing or for training sets. The selection of parameters is of central importance in building a robust classifier that generalizes and led us to state of the art results in the context of the complex pain intensity estimation task on the BioVid Heat Pain data set.

TI  - Precision Pharmacogenomic Perioperative Prediction
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Background: The VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) predicts risk for importantpostoperative outcomes and shares process improvements from high performance sites with lowerperformance sites to continuously improve surgical outcomes. The VASQIP was so successful it wasimplemented in the private sector and continues today. The proposed research will add pharmacogenomicdata from the Million Veterans Program (MVP) to the VASQIP. In addition, the VASQIP is collaborating withthe VA National Artificial Intelligence Institute (NAII) to add more phenotype data from other VA databasesincluding VASQIP, Centralized Interactive Phenomics Resource (CIPHER), VA Informatics and ComputingInfrastructure (VINCI), and the Corporate Data Warehouse. This phenotype data will also be added to theVASQIP and machine learning/ artificial intelligence will be used to update the VASQIP in a separate projectthat will be done in parallel.Significance: Pharmacogenomics examines an individual person’s genes that affect drug metabolism, drugtarget, drug transport, or drug immune response and the impact on adverse drug events and treatmenteffectiveness. Pharmacogenomics can explain the variation in treatment response that is commonly seen inclinical practice. Pharmacogenomics has been associated with both worse and improved outcomes and costeffectiveness in a number of clinical settings. Pharmacogenomic data is included on 499 FDA drug labels.Despite this acknowledgement of the benefits of Pharmacogenomic testing, such testing is not routinelycompleted within the VA in general, and not for surgery specifically.Innovation & Impact: There are several innovative approaches to the proposed research. Applyingpharmacogenomic data to surgical outcomes, using machine learning and artificial intelligence to addphenotypic data to the VASQIP program with the goal of rapidly implementing the results into patient care tooptimize patient centered decision making and outcomes are all innovative.Specific Aims: 1) Identify pharmacogenomic risk associations with outcomes among individuals receivingvascular surgery and cardiac surgery the past 10 years for established (tier 1 and 2) drug/ gene sets. 2)Identify pharmacogenomic risk associations with outcomes among individuals receiving vascular surgery andcardiac surgery the past 10 years for non-established (tier 3) drug/ gene sets. 3) Assess frequency of studydrug usage and presence of pharmacogenomic genes for power modeling future studies. 4) Identify high-risksubgroups that may benefit from pharmacogenomic testing.Methodology: This is a retrospective cohort study that will use the standard VASQIP variables and outcomes.Baseline analysis will use linear regression or Cox’s proportional hazards model and will control for patientbaseline characteristics and surgical factors using propensity scores with matching or inverse weighting.Machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks, classification and regression trees, or ensemblelearning will be used to improve predictions and account for nonlinear relationships and interactions amongthe potentially large set of pharmacogenomic features.Next Steps/Implementation: The results of the proposed research will be used to update all VASQIPsurgeries, then field implementation can occur for real time clinical decision support. High risk patientsubgroups will be identified that would benefit from preoperative pharmacogenomic testing and furtherintervention studies.

AB  - The use of Hybrid Artificial Intelligent techniques in medicine has increased in recent years. Specifically, one of the main challenges in anesthesia is achieving new controllers capable of automating the drug titration during surgeries. This work deals with the development of a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller to automate the drug infusion for the control of hypnosis in patients undergoing anesthesia. To do that, a combination of Neural Networks and optimization techniques were applied to tune the internal parameters of the fuzzy controller. For the training process, data from 20 patients undergoing surgery were used. Finally, the controller proposed was tested over 16 virtual surgeries. It was concluded that the fuzzy controller was able to meet both clinical and control objectives.

AB  - Development of closed-loop control strategies for drug infusion and delivery is one of the most recent efforts of control engineers and clinicians. This can be used especially in anesthesia during different surgeries to stabilize the patient in the desired awareness condition. In this paper, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy controller is proposed to overcome the current challenges in closed-loop control of anesthesia such as inter and intra patient variability, complex and nonlinear dynamics, measurement noises and surgical disturbances as well as the presence of undershoot and overshoot in the induction phase. The results show an acceptable performance of the proposed controller in solving these problems by providing a learning scheme.

TI  - Artifacts annotations in anesthesia blood pressure data by man and machine
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Physiologic data from anesthesia monitors are automatically captured. Yet erroneous data are stored in the process as well. While this is not interfering with clinical care, research can be affected. Researchers should find ways to remove artifacts. The aim of the present study was to compare different artifact annotation strategies, and to assess if a machine learning algorithm is able to accept or reject individual data points. Non-cardiac procedures requiring invasive blood pressure monitoring were eligible. Two trained research assistants observed procedures live for artifacts. The same procedures were also retrospectively annotated for artifacts by a different person. We compared the different ways of artifact identifications and modelled artifacts with three different learning algorithms (lasso restrictive logistic regression, neural network and support vector machine). In 88 surgical procedures including 5711 blood pressure data points, the live observed incidence of artifacts was 2.1% and the retrospective incidence was 2.2%. Comparing retrospective with live annotation revealed a sensitivity of 0.32 and specificity of 0.98. The performance of the learning algorithms which we applied ranged from poor (kappa 0.053) to moderate (kappa 0.651). Manual identification of artifacts yielded different incidences in different situations, which were not comparable. Artifact detection in physiologic data collected during anesthesia could be automated, but the performance of the learning algorithms in the present study remained moderate. Future research should focus on optimization and finding ways to apply them with minimal manual work. The present study underlines the importance of an explicit definition for artifacts in database research.

TI  - Machine learning-based causal models for predicting the response of individual patients to dexamethasone treatment as prophylactic antiemetic
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Risk-based strategies are widely used for decision making in the prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), a major complication of general anesthesia. However, whether risk is associated with individual treatment effect remains uncertain. Here, we used machine learning-based algorithms for estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) (double machine learning [DML], doubly robust [DR] learner, forest DML, and generalized random forest) to predict the treatment response heterogeneity of dexamethasone, the first choice for prophylactic antiemetics. Electronic health record data of 2026 adult patients who underwent general anesthesia from January to June 2020 were analyzed. The results indicated that only a small subset of patients respond to dexamethasone treatment, and many patients may be non-responders. Estimated CATE did not correlate with predicted risk, suggesting that risk may not be associated with individual treatment responses. The current study suggests that predicting treatment responders by CATE models may be more appropriate for clinical decision making than conventional risk-based strategy.

TI  - Skill Assessment of an Epidural Anesthesia Using the PeriSIM Simulator
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL ROBOTICS AND BIONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the training in the lumbar epidural anesthesia procedure, a very common procedure, is mainly performed on patients under the supervision of experts. The reason for this situation is that the simulators that exist on the market are not realistic enough to efficiently learn this particularly haptic-sense-based gesture. To avoid this ethical issue and provide an efficient, repeatable, and affordable way of safely learning this gesture, the Ampere laboratory designed PeriSIM: a haptic training computer-based simulator. In this article, the trainees' skill assessment is tackled. This work presents various machine learning approaches to the evaluation of trainees and introduces a complete skill assessment algorithm to use in conjunction with the PeriSIM simulator. This work also aims to determine the important variables of an lumbar epidural anesthesia procedure for objective assessment purpose.

TI  - Clinical outcome prediction from analysis of microelectrode recordings using deep learning in subthalamic deep brain stimulation for Parkinson`s disease
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDeep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for improving the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Accurate positioning of the stimulation electrodes is necessary for better clinical outcomes.ObjectiveWe applied deep learning techniques to microelectrode recording (MER) signals to better predict motor function improvement, represented by the UPDRS part III scores, after bilateral STN DBS in patients with advanced PD. If we find the optimal stimulation point with MER by deep learning, we can improve the clinical outcome of STN DBS even under restrictions such as general anesthesia or non-cooperation of the patients.MethodsIn total, 696 4-second left-side MER segments from 34 patients with advanced PD who underwent bilateral STN DBS surgery under general anesthesia were included. We transformed the original signal into three wavelets of 1-50 Hz, 50-500 Hz, and 500-5,000 Hz. The wavelet-transformed MER was used for input data of the deep learning. The patients were divided into two groups, good response and moderate response groups, according to DBS on to off ratio of UPDRS part III score for the off-medication state, 6 months postoperatively. The ratio were used for output data in deep learning. The Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16 model with a multitask learning algorithm was used to estimate the bilateral effect of DBS. Different ratios of the loss function in the task-specific layer were applied considering that DBS affects both sides differently.ResultsWhen we divided the MER signals according to the frequency, the maximal accuracy was higher in the 50-500 Hz group than in the 1-50 Hz and 500-5,000 Hz groups. In addition, when the multitask learning method was applied, the stability of the model was improved in comparison with single task learning. The maximal accuracy (80.21%) occurred when the right-to-left loss ratio was 5:1 or 6:1. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.88 in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.ConclusionClinical improvements in PD patients who underwent bilateral STN DBS could be predicted based on a multitask deep learning-based MER analysis.

TI  - Applied computer technologies in clinical decision support systems for pain management: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - Millions of people around the world suffer from pain, acute or chronic and this raises the importance of its screening, assessment and treatment. Pain, is highly subjective and the use of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can play an important part in improving the accuracy of pain assessment, and lead to better clinical practices. This review examines CDSSs, in relation to computer technologies and was conducted with the following electronic databases: CiteSeer(x), IEEE Xplore, ISI Web of Knowledge, Mendeley, Microsoft Academic Search, PubMed, Science Accelerator, Science. gov, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and The Cochrane Library. The studies referenced were compiled with several criteria in mind. Firstly, that they constituted a decision support system. Secondly, that study data included pain values or results based on the detection of pain. Thirdly, that they were published in English, between 1992 and 2011, and finally that they focused on patients with acute or chronic pain. In total, thirty-nine studies highlighted the following topics: rule based algorithms, artificial neural networks, rough and fuzzy sets, statistical learning algorithms, terminologies, questionnaires and scores. The median accuracy ranged from 53% to 87.5%. The lack of integration with mobile devices, the limited use of web-based interfaces and the scarcity of systems that allow for data to be inserted by patients were all limitations that were detected.

TI  - Optimization of Propofol Dose Estimated During Anesthesia Through Artificial Intelligence by Genetic Algorithm: Design and Clinical Assessment
T2  - NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the application of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to assign the optimal dose of propofol as a vital anesthetic drug considering patient needs. The purpose of this research was to explore the factors that influence the propofol dosage needed to sedate patients. This paper estimates the drug dose to regulate the depth of anesthesia by administrating propofol. In this regard, two artificial intelligence approaches; a feedforward neural network and ANFIS are applied to predict the propofol dose. Introducing an estimator to control automatically might provide remarkable advantages for the patient in reducing the risk for under- and over-dosing. The suggested estimations are compared with results extracted from the classical model revised method and then evaluated patients undergoing surgery in a Mashhad's hospital to identify a research innovation. The propofol doses are optimized using a genetic algorithm. Sensitivity analysis methods are used to test the estimator using a collection of patient models consisting of some populations. Finally, during anesthesia, an optimal dose estimator allows for a rapid period of induction with reasonable overshoot and adequate disturbance rejection results. The novelty of this study is in estimating without using Bi-spectral Index signal and also there is a significant reduction in anesthesia costs by optimizing the drug dose. The results of the optimization model show a 14.06% saving of propofol dose with MSE 5.3 x 10(-6).

AB  - Growing uses of opioids for pain management have led to a crisis of addiction and thousands of deaths in the United States. Although many of the opioid effects have been observed and reported, experience directly from the opioid users may help provide additional information in identifying any potentially unreported effects. In this study, we developed a neural embedding-based method to discover potential opioid-effect relations through similar relations of known medication effects. Using a corpus of 3.6 million clean unannotated tweets, a vector space model was learned with word2vec, and the model was used to identify potential opioid effects. The inferred results were further verified against 5 authoritative sources of medication effects. Seven of inferred effects were identified as potentially unreported, demonstrating the power and utility of our method. It is conceivable that our approach can be applied to discovery of potentially unreported effects of other medications.

TI  - Telemedicine, E-Health, and Multi-Agent Systems for Chronic Pain Management
T2  - CLINICS AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Telemedicine, telehealth, and E-health all offer significant benefits for pain management and healthcare services by fostering the physician-patient relationship in otherwise challenging circumstances. A critical component of these artificial-intelligence-based health systems is the "agent-based system", which is rapidly evolving as a means of resolving complicated or straightforward problems. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are well-established modeling and problem-solving modalities that model and solve real-world problems. MAS's core concept is to foster communication and cooperation among agents, which are broadly considered intelligent autonomous factors, to address diverse challenges. MAS are used in various telecommunications applications, including the internet, robotics, healthcare, and medicine. Furthermore, MAS and information technology are utilized to enhance patient-centered palliative care. While telemedicine, E-health, and MAS all play critical roles in managing chronic pain, the published research on their use in treating chronic pain is currently limited. This paper discusses why telemedicine, E-health, and MAS are the most critical novel technologies for providing healthcare and managing chronic pain. This review also provides context for identifying the advantages and disadvantages of each application's features, which may serve as a useful tool for researchers.

AB  - Peripheral Nerve Blocking (PNB), is a procedure used for performing regional anesthesia, that comprises the administration of anesthetic in the proximity of a nerve. Several techniques have been used with the purpose of locating nerve structures when the PNB procedure is performed: anatomical surface landmarks, elicitation of paresthesia, nerve stimulation and ultrasound imaging. Among those, ultrasound imaging has gained great attention because it is not invasive and offers an accurate location of the nerve and the structures around it. However, the segmentation of nerve structures in ultrasound images is a difficult task for the specialist, since such images are affected by echo perturbations and speckle noise. The development of systems for the automatic segmentation of nerve structures can aid the specialist for locating nerve structures accurately. In this paper we present a methodology for the automatic segmentation of nerve structures in ultrasound images. An initial step is carried out using Graph Cut segmentation in order to generate regions of interest; we then use machine learning techniques with the aim of segmenting the nerve structure; here, a specific non-linear Wavelet transform is used for the feature extraction stage, and Gaussian processes for the classification step. The methodology performance is measured in terms of accuracy and the dice coefficient. Results show that the implemented methodology can be used for automatically segmenting nerve structures.

TI  - Research progress in pain management in day surgery for children
T2  - Journal of Clinical Anesthestology
M3  - Review
AB  - The special anatomical and physiological characteristics of children make them prone to respiratory depression after surgery, and it is difficult to describe the pain, which limits the implementation of postoperative analgesia to a certain extent, affects the recovery of children and leads to prolonged hospital stay. Appropriate and effective postoperative analgesia is beneficial to ensure the safe implementation of day surgery, promote postoperative rehabilitation and improve medical satisfaction. At present, the application of multi-mode analgesia to deopioid after surgery has gradually become a consensus, and the perioperative social psychological factors of children and their caregivers have received more and more attention. The development of multi-genomics and artificial intelligence provides the possibility for more individualized and humanized analgesia programs, but there is still a lack of accurate and unified methods for postoperative pain assessment in children. With the development of day surgery and the advancement of comfortable medicine, the establishment of a sound pain management system for children's day surgery has become an urgent problem for scholars at home and abroad. This paper reviews the research progress of perioperative pain management for children's day surgery, in order to provide reference for postoperative analgesia programs for children's day surgery.

M3  - Review
AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: The current review will attempt to describe the important lessons learned from published randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing water immersion (WI) or water exchange (WE) techniques with gas insufflation colonoscopy. Air insufflation (AI) to distend the colon to permit visualization and passage through the lumen was developed for diagnostic colonoscopy. When screening colonoscopy was adopted, the same AI method was used. Interval cancers, diagnosed within 3 to 5years after an index screening colonoscopy, appeared to be linked to low adenoma detection rate (ADR). Conscious sedation was introduced to manage insertion pain a few decades ago, incurring moderate costs of nursing staff, space for recovery, patient burdens of escort requirement, and at home recovery time. Recent advancement to deep sedation entailed additional costs of anesthesia staff support. In the past decade, investigators worldwide evaluated the use of water-assisted methods as an adjunct or in lieu of gas insufflation during insertion to minimize discomfort and improve ease of insertion. For convenience, one approach embraced the removal of infused water during withdrawal (WI). A subsequent evolution entailed removal of infused water predominantly during insertion (WE), specifically designed to further minimize insertion pain. Results of RCT shed light on the impact of WI and WE on insertion pain (primary outcome) and adenoma detection (secondary outcome). Water immersion is easier to learn and apply than WE, but mastery of the WE technique appears to have two major advantages. Current RCT data suggest that both WI and WE decrease insertion pain and facilitate completion of difficult colonoscopy, with WE having a superior impact than WI. Water exchange was serendipitously associated with an increase in ADR; this has been repeatedly confirmed in follow-up studies. When it is unknown which patient's colonoscopy will be difficult, it would seem prudent for the average colonoscopist to optimize the chance of success and increase in ADR by using WE from the very start.

TI  - An explainable supervised machine learning predictor of acute kidney injury after adult deceased donor liver transplantation
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Early prediction of acute kidney injury (AKI) after liver transplantation (LT) facilitates timely recognition and intervention. We aimed to build a risk predictor of post-LT AKI via supervised machine learning and visualize the mechanism driving within to assist clinical decision-making.Methods: Data of 894 cases that underwent liver transplantation from January 2015 to September 2019 were collected, covering demographics, donor characteristics, etiology, peri-operative laboratory results, co-morbidities and medications. The primary outcome was new-onset AKI after LT according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. Predicting performance of five classifiers including logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM) and adaptive boosting were respectively evaluated by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity and specificity. Model with the best performance was validated in an independent dataset involving 195 adult LT cases from October 2019 to March 2021. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was applied to evaluate feature importance and explain the predictions made by ML algorithms.Results: 430 AKI cases (55.1%) were diagnosed out of 780 included cases. The GBM model achieved the highest AUC (0.76, CI 0.70 to 0.82), F1-score (0.73, CI 0.66 to 0.79) and sensitivity (0.74, CI 0.66 to 0.8) in the internal validation set, and a comparable AUC (0.75, CI 0.67 to 0.81) in the external validation set. High preoperative indirect bilirubin, low intraoperative urine output, long anesthesia time, low preoperative platelets, and graft steatosis graded NASH CRN 1 and above were revealed by SHAP method the top 5 important variables contributing to the diagnosis of post-LT AKI made by GBM model.Conclusions: Our GBM-based predictor of post-LT AKI provides a highly interoperable tool across institutions to assist decision-making after LT.

TI  - The use of artificial intelligence and robotics in regional anaesthesia
T2  - ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - The current fourth industrial revolution is a distinct technological era characterised by the blurring of physics, computing and biology. The driver of change is data, powered by artificial intelligence. The UK National Health Service Topol Report embraced this digital revolution and emphasised the importance of artificial intelligence to the health service. Application of artificial intelligence within regional anaesthesia, however, remains limited. An example of the use of a convoluted neural network applied to visual detection of nerves on ultrasound images is described. New technologies that may impact on regional anaesthesia include robotics and artificial sensing. Robotics in anaesthesia falls into three categories. The first, used commonly, is pharmaceutical, typified by target-controlled anaesthesia using electroencephalography within a feedback loop. Other types include mechanical robots that provide precision and dexterity better than humans, and cognitive robots that act as decision support systems. It is likely that the latter technology will expand considerably over the next decades and provide an autopilot for anaesthesia. Technical robotics will focus on the development of accurate sensors for training that incorporate visual and motion metrics. These will be incorporated into augmented reality and visual reality environments that will provide training at home or the office on life-like simulators. Real-time feedback will be offered that stimulates and rewards performance. In discussing the scope, applications, limitations and barriers to adoption of these technologies, we aimed to stimulate discussion towards a framework for the optimal application of current and emerging technologies in regional anaesthesia.

AB  - Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to fit a mapping from patient state to a medication regimen. Prior studies have used deterministic and value-based tabular learning to learn a propofol dose from an observed anesthetic state. Deep RL replaces the table with a deep neural network and has been used to learn medication regimens from registry databases. Here we perform the first application of deep RL to closed-loop control of anesthetic dosing in a simulated environment. We use the cross-entropy method to train a deep neural network to map an observed anesthetic state to a probability of infusing a fixed propofol dosage. During testing, we implement a deterministic policy that transforms the probability of infusion to a continuous infusion rate. The model is trained and tested on simulated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models with randomized parameters to ensure robustness to patient variability. The deep RL agent significantly outperformed a proportional-integral-derivative controller (median absolute performance error 1.7% +/- 0.6 and 3.4% +/- 1.2). Modeling continuous input variables instead of a table affords more robust pattern recognition and utilizes our prior domain knowledge. Deep RL learned a smooth policy with a natural interpretation to data scientists and anesthesia care providers alike.

TI  - Effects of sedatives and opioids on trigger and cycling asynchronies throughout mechanical ventilation: an observational study in a large dataset from critically ill patients
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn critically ill patients, poor patient-ventilator interaction may worsen outcomes. Although sedatives are often administered to improve comfort and facilitate ventilation, they can be deleterious. Whether opioids improve asynchronies with fewer negative effects is unknown. We hypothesized that opioids alone would improve asynchronies and result in more wakeful patients than sedatives alone or sedatives-plus-opioids.MethodsThis prospective multicenter observational trial enrolled critically ill adults mechanically ventilated (MV) >24h. We compared asynchronies and sedation depth in patients receiving sedatives, opioids, or both. We recorded sedation level and doses of sedatives and opioids. BetterCare (TM) software continuously registered ineffective inspiratory efforts during expiration (IEE), double cycling (DC), and asynchrony index (AI) as well as MV modes. All variables were averaged per day. We used linear mixed-effects models to analyze the relationships between asynchronies, sedation level, and sedative and opioid doses.ResultsIn 79 patients, 14,166,469 breaths were recorded during 579days of MV. Overall asynchronies were not significantly different in days classified as sedatives-only, opioids-only, and sedatives-plus-opioids and were more prevalent in days classified as no-drugs than in those classified as sedatives-plus-opioids, irrespective of the ventilatory mode. Sedative doses were associated with sedation level and with reduced DC (p<0.0001) in sedatives-only days. However, on days classified as sedatives-plus-opioids, higher sedative doses and deeper sedation had more IEE (p<0.0001) and higher AI (p=0.0004). Opioid dosing was inversely associated with overall asynchronies (p<0.001) without worsening sedation levels into morbid ranges.ConclusionsSedatives, whether alone or combined with opioids, do not result in better patient-ventilator interaction than opioids alone, in any ventilatory mode. Higher opioid dose (alone or with sedatives) was associated with lower AI without depressing consciousness. Higher sedative doses administered alone were associated only with less DC.Trial registrationClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03451461

TI  - Automated preclinical detection of mechanical pain hypersensitivity and analgesia
T2  - PAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of sensitive and robust behavioral assessments of pain in preclinical models has been a major limitation for both pain research and the development of novel analgesics. Here, we demonstrate a novel data acquisition and analysis platform that provides automated, quantitative, and objective measures of naturalistic rodent behavior in an observer-independent and unbiased fashion. The technology records freely behaving mice, in the dark, over extended periods for continuous acquisition of 2 parallel video data streams: (1) near-infrared frustrated total internal reflection for detecting the degree, force, and timing of surface contact and (2) simultaneous ongoing video graphing of whole-body pose. Using machine vision and machine learning, we automatically extract and quantify behavioral features from these data to reveal moment-by-moment changes that capture the internal pain state of rodents in multiple pain models. We show that these voluntary pain-related behaviors are reversible by analgesics and that analgesia can be automatically and objectively differentiated from sedation. Finally, we used this approach to generate a paw luminance ratio measure that is sensitive in capturing dynamic mechanical hypersensitivity over a period and scalable for high-throughput preclinical analgesic efficacy assessment.

M3  - Review
AB  - Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common birth anomalies, and the care of children with CHD has improved over the past 4 decades. However, children with CHD who undergo general anesthesia remain at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. The proliferation of electronic health record systems and sophisticated patient monitors affords the opportunity to capture and analyze large amounts of CHD patient data, and the application of novel, effective analytics methods to these data can enable clinicians to enhance their care of pediatric CHD patients. This narrative review covers recent efforts to leverage analytics in pediatric cardiac anesthesia and critical care to improve the care of children with CHD. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Robust prediction of nonhome discharge following elective anterior cervical discectomy and fusion using explainable machine learning
T2  - EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposePredict nonhome discharge (NHD) following elective anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) using an explainable machine learning model.Methods2227 patients undergoing elective ACDF from 2008 to 2019 were identified from a single institutional database. A machine learning model was trained on preoperative variables, including demographics, comorbidity indices, and levels fused. The validation technique was repeated stratified K-Fold cross validation with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) statistic as the performance metric. Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were calculated to provide further explainability regarding the model's decision making.ResultsThe preoperative model performed with an AUROC of 0.83 +/- 0.05. SHAP scores revealed the most pertinent risk factors to be age, medicare insurance, and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score. Interaction analysis demonstrated that female patients over 65 with greater fusion levels were more likely to undergo NHD. Likewise, ASA demonstrated positive interaction effects with female sex, levels fused and BMI.ConclusionWe validated an explainable machine learning model for the prediction of NHD using common preoperative variables. Adding transparency is a key step towards clinical application because it demonstrates that our model's "thinking" aligns with clinical reasoning. Interactive analysis demonstrated that those of age over 65, female sex, higher ASA score, and greater fusion levels were more predisposed to NHD. Age and ASA score were similar in their predictive ability. Machine learning may be used to predict NHD, and can assist surgeons with patient counseling or early discharge planning.

TI  - Development and validation of a difficult laryngoscopy prediction model using machine learning of neck circumference and thyromental height
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Predicting difficult airway is challengeable in patients with limited airway evaluation. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a model that predicts difficult laryngoscopy by machine learning of neck circumference and thyromental height as predictors that can be used even for patients with limited airway evaluation. Methods Variables for prediction of difficulty laryngoscopy included age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, neck circumference, and thyromental distance. Difficult laryngoscopy was defined as Grade 3 and 4 by the Cormack-Lehane classification. The preanesthesia and anesthesia data of 1677 patients who had undergone general anesthesia at a single center were collected. The data set was randomly stratified into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%), with equal distribution of difficulty laryngoscopy. The training data sets were trained with five algorithms (logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine). The prediction models were validated through a test set. Results The model's performance using random forest was best (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.79 [95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.86], area under precision-recall curve = 0.32 [95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.37]). Conclusions Machine learning can predict difficult laryngoscopy through a combination of several predictors including neck circumference and thyromental height. The performance of the model can be improved with more data, a new variable and combination of models.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - The preoperative qualitative and hierarchical diagnosis of intervertebral foramen stenosis is very important for clinicians to explore the effect of multimodal analgesia nursing on pain control after spinal fusion and to formulate treatment strategies and patients' health recovery. However, there are still many problems in this aspect, and there is a lack of relevant research and effective methods to assist clinicians in diagnosis. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of computer-aided diagnosis of intervertebral foramen stenosis and the work efficiency of doctors, a deep learning automatic grading algorithm of intervertebral foramen stenosis image is proposed in this study. The image of intervertebral foramen was extracted from the MRI image of sagittal spine, and the image was preprocessed. 86 patients with spinal fusion treated in our hospital, specifically from May 2018 to May 2020, were randomly divided into the control group (routine analgesic nursing) and the multimodal group (multimodal analgesic nursing), with 43 cases in each group. The pain control effect and satisfaction of the two groups were observed. The results after multimodal analgesia nursing show that the VASs of the multimodal group at different time points were significantly lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05); the satisfaction score of pain control in the multimodal group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Multimodal analgesia nursing for patients undergoing spinal fusion can effectively reduce the degree of postoperative pain and improve the effect of pain control and satisfaction with pain control, which is worthy of promotion.

TI  - Machine learning for dynamic and early prediction of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery increases morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis relies on oliguria or increased serum creatinine, which develop 48 to 72 hours after injury. We hypothesized machine learning incorporating preoperative, operative, and intensive care unit data could dynamically predict acute kidney injury before conventional identification.Methods: Cardiac surgery patients at a tertiary hospital (2008-2019) were identified using electronic medical records in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Preoperative and intraoperative parameters included demographics, Charlson Comorbidity subcategories, and operative details. Intensive care unit data included hemodynamics, medications, fluid intake/output, and laboratory results.Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria were used for acute kidney injury diagnosis. An ensemble machine learning model was trained for hourly predictions of future acute kidney injury within 48 hours. Performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and balanced accuracy.Results: Within the cohort (n 1/4 4267), there were approximately 7 million data points. Median baseline creatinine was 1.0 g/dL (interquartile range, 0.8-1.2), with 17% (735/4267) of patients having chronic kidney disease. Postoperative stage 1 acute kidney injury occurred in 50% (2129/4267), stage 2 occurred in 8% (324/ 4267), and stage 3 occurred in 4% (183/4267). For hourly prediction of any acute kidney injury over the next 48 hours, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.82, and balanced accuracy was 75%. For hourly prediction of stage 2 or greater acute kidney injury over the next 48 hours, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.95 and balanced accuracy was 86%. The model predicted acute kidney injury before clinical detection in 89% of cases.Conclusions: Ensemble machine learning models using electronic medical records data can dynamically predict acute kidney injury risk after cardiac surgery. Continuous postoperative risk assessment could facilitate interventions to limit or prevent renal injury. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2023;166:e551-64)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prediction of the depth of anesthesia is a difficult job in the biomedical field.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build a boosting-based prediction model to predict the depth of anesthesia based on four clinical monitoring data.METHODS: Boosting is a framework algorithm that is used to train a series of weak learners into strong learners by assigning different weights according to their classification accuracy. The input of the boosting-based prediction model included four types of clinical monitoring data: electromyography, end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure, remifentanil dosage, and flow rate. The output was the depth of anesthesia.RESULTS: The boosting framework model built in this study achieved higher prediction accuracy and a lower discrete degree in predicting the depth of anesthesia compared with the DT-, KNN-, and SVM-based models.CONCLUSIONS: The boosting framework was used to set up a prediction model to predict the depth of anesthesia based on four clinical monitoring data. In the experiments, the boosting framework model of this study achieved higher prediction accuracy and a lower discrete degree. This model will be useful in predicting the depth of anesthesia.

TI  - Assistive system based on nerve detection and needle navigation in ultrasound images for regional anesthesia
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia (UGRA) is of great help to practitioners of regional anesthesia as it enables real time visualization of the needle, the targeted nerve, and different anatomic structures. However, the clinician has to perform a complex hand coordination to keep the needle, the nerve and some key regions visible in the ultrasound image plane. Daily clinical practice therefore requires a high degree of training and practical skill to identify the nerve block and steer the needle to it There are two critical steps in UGRA: the recognition of anatomical structures and steering the needle to the target region. An intelligent system, with the ability to identify the regions of interest and to provide the needle insertion trajectory in ultrasound images, can significantly improve UGRA practice and generalize it to medical facilities that lack practitioners. It would also make the UGRA procedure safer (i.e., reducing the risk of nerve trauma). This work presents the first fully automatic system for the detection of regions of interest and generation of the needle trajectory for UGRA. Several problems were addressed, in two stages. The first one consisted in the automatic localization and segmentation of the nerve (target) and arteries (obstacles) in ultrasound images. A new method based on a machine learning algorithm with a multi-model classification process using a sliding window for localization, then an active contour was applied to delineate the localized regions. In the second stage, an algorithm for path planning was also developed to obtain the optimal trajectory for needle insertion based on the result of the first stage (target and obstacle detection). To check the effectiveness of the proposed system, firstly, experiments were performed over individual modules of the detection framework. Secondly, a comparison between the overall framework and the existing method was performed. Two data-sets were acquired in real conditions at different times to prove the robustness of our method. The first data-set contained eight patients and the second data-set, acquired one year later, contained five patients. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme and the feasibility of such an assistive system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conventionally, monitoring the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is performed using the standard procedures of either observing the patient's vitals or through commercial electroencephalogram (EEG)-based monitors. The reports of intraoperative awareness indicate that these methods are still unreliable for all patients and anesthetic agents. This paper proposes a novel approach for accurate DoA estimation based on Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and fractal features while utilizing Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier, a class of Feed Forward Neural Network. The classifier utilizes an optimized temporal, fractal and spectral feature set to identify the patient conscious level irrespective of age and the type of anesthetic agent. The proposed algorithm is validated on 95 patients (age 5 months-67 years), (weight: 6 - 90 Kg). The anesthetic agents used in this study include Propofol, Sevoflurane, Isoflurane, Fentanyl, Ketamine, and Caudal. The proposed DoA classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art DoA prediction algorithms with the highest accuracy of 96.8% while utilizing minimized feature set and a deep learning-based MLP classifier for the first time in literature.

TI  - Machine learning for predicting acute hypotension: A systematic review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - An acute hypotensive episode (AHE) can lead to severe consequences and complications that threaten patients' lives within a short period of time. How to accurately and non-invasively predict AHE in advance has become a hot clinical topic that has attracted a lot of attention in the medical and engineering communities. In the last 20 years, with rapid advancements in machine learning methodology, this topic has been viewed from a different perspective. This review paper examines studies published from 2008 to 2021 that evaluated the performance of various machine learning algorithms developed to predict AHE. A total of 437 articles were found in four databases that were searched, and 35 full-text articles were included in this review. Fourteen machine learning algorithms were assessed in these 35 articles; the Support Vector Machine algorithm was studied in 12 articles, followed by Logistic Regression (six articles) and Artificial Neural Network (six articles). The accuracy of the algorithms ranged from 70 to 96%. The size of the study sample varied from small (12 subjects) to very large (3,825 subjects). Recommendations for future work are also discussed in this review.

TI  - Construction and Comparison of Predictive Models for Length of Stay after Total Knee Arthroplasty: Regression Model and Machine Learning Analysis Based on 1,826 Cases in a Single Singapore Center
T2  - JOURNAL OF KNEE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive model for length of stay (LOS) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Between 2013 and 2014, 1,826 patients who underwent TKA from a single Singapore center were enrolled in the study after qualification. Demographics of patients with normal and prolonged LOS were analyzed. The risk variables that could affect LOS were identified by univariate analysis. Predictive models for LOS after TKA by logistic regression or machine learning were constructed and compared. The univariate analysis showed that age, American Society of Anesthesiologist level, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, general anesthesia, and operation duration were risk factors that could affect LOS ( p < 0.05). Comparing with logistic regression models, the machine learning model with all variables was the best model to predict LOS after TKA, of whose area of operator characteristic curve was 0.738. Machine learning algorithms improved the predictive performance of LOS prediction models for TKA patients.

TI  - A rapid and effective nonsurgical artificial insemination protocol using the NSET™ device for sperm transfer in mice without anesthesia
T2  - TRANSGENIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial insemination (AI) is an assisted reproductive technique that is implemented successfully in humans as a fertility treatment, performed extensively for commercial breeding of livestock, and is also successful in laboratory rodents. AI in the mouse may be especially useful for breeding of transgenic or mutant mice with fertility problems, expansion of mouse colonies, and as an alternative to in vitro fertilization. Nonsurgical AI techniques for the mouse have been described previously but are not often implemented due to technical difficulties. Here we compare various protocols for preparation of CD1 recipients prior to AI for na < ve (in estrus), ovulation-induced, and superovulated females. Timing of hormone administration relative to sperm delivery is also compared. An improved protocol for nonsurgical AI in mice is described, which incorporates a convenient hormone administration schedule for female recipients and rapid, non-stressful sperm transfer without the need for anesthesia or analgesia.

TI  - Shape constraint function for artery tracking in ultrasound images
T2  - COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ultrasound guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) has emerged as a powerful technique for pain management in the operating theatre. It uses ultrasound imaging to visualize anatomical structures, the needle insertion and the delivery of the anesthetic around the targeted nerve block. Detection of the nerves is a difficult task, however, due to the poor quality of the ultrasound images. Recent developments in pattern recognition and machine learning have heightened the need for computer aided systems in many applications. This type of system can improve UGRA practice. In many imaging situations nerves are not salient in images. Generally, practitioners rely on the arteries as key anatomical structures to confirm the positions of the nerves, making artery tracking an important aspect for UGRA procedure. However, artery tracking in a noisy environment is a challenging prob-lem, due to the instability of the features. This paper proposes a new method for real-time artery tracking in ultrasound images. It is based on shape information to correct tracker location errors. A new objective function is proposed, which defines an artery as an elliptical shape, enabling its robust fitting in a noisy environment. This approach is incorporated in two well-known tracking algorithms, and shows a systematic improvement over the original trackers. Evaluations were performed on 71 videos of different axillary nerve blocks. The results ob-tained demonstrated the validity of the proposed method.

AB  - We demonstrate the use of reinforcement learning algorithms for efficient and personalized control of patients' depth of general anesthesia during surgical procedures - an important aspect for Neurotechnology. We used the continuous actor-critic learning automaton technique, which was trained and tested in silico using published patient data, physiological simulation and the bispectral index (BIS) of patient EEG. Our two-stage technique learns first a generic effective control strategy based on average patient data (factory stage) and can then fine-tune itself to individual patients (personalization stage). The results showed that the reinforcement learner as compared to a bang-bang controller reduced the dose of the anesthetic agent administered by 9.4% and kept the patient closer to the target state, as measured by RMSE (4.90 compared to 8.47). It also kept the BIS error within a narrow, clinically acceptable range 93.9% of the time. Moreover, the policy was trained using only 50 simulated operations. Being able to learn a control strategy this quickly indicates that the reinforcement learner could also adapt regularly to a patient's changing responses throughout a live operation and facilitate the task of anesthesiologists by prompting them with recommended actions.

TI  - The Association Between Ventilator Dyssynchrony, Delivered Tidal Volume, and Sedation Using a Novel Automated Ventilator Dyssynchrony Detection Algorithm
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Ventilator dyssynchrony is potentially harmful to patients with or at risk for the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Automated detection of ventilator dyssynchrony from ventilator waveforms has been difficult. It is unclear if certain types of ventilator dyssynchrony deliver large tidal volumes and whether levels of sedation alter the frequency of ventilator dyssynchrony.Design: A prospective observational study.Setting: A university medical ICU.Patients: Patients with or at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome.Interventions: Continuous pressure-time, flow-time, and volume-time data were directly obtained from the ventilator. The level of sedation and the use of neuromuscular blockade was extracted from the medical record. Machine learning algorithms that incorporate clinical insight were developed and trained to detect four previously described and clinically relevant forms of ventilator dyssynchrony. The association between normalized tidal volume and ventilator dyssynchrony and the association between sedation and the frequency of ventilator dyssynchrony were determined.Measurements and Main Results: A total of 4.26 million breaths were recorded from 62 ventilated patients. Our algorithm detected three types of ventilator dyssynchrony with an area under the receiver operator curve of greater than 0.89. Ventilator dyssynchrony occurred in 34.4% (95% CI, 34.41-34.49%) of breaths. When compared with synchronous breaths, double-triggered and flow-limited breaths were more likely to deliver tidal volumes greater than 10 mL/kg (40% and 11% compared with 0.2%; p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Deep sedation reduced but did not eliminate the frequency of all ventilator dyssynchrony breaths (p < 0.05). Ventilator dyssynchrony was eliminated with neuromuscular blockade (p < 0.001).Conclusion: We developed a computerized algorithm that accurately detects three types of ventilator dyssynchrony. Double-triggered and flow-limited breaths are associated with the frequent delivery of tidal volumes of greater than 10 mL/kg. Although ventilator dyssynchrony is reduced by deep sedation, potentially deleterious tidal volumes may still be delivered. However, neuromuscular blockade effectively eliminates ventilator dyssynchrony.

AB  - Economic and technologic progresses states the analysis of human's exhaled air as a promising tool for medical diagnosis and therapy monitoring. Challenges of most pulmonary breath acquisition devices are related to the substances' concentrations that are source (oral cavity, esophageal and alveolar) dependent and their low values (in ppbv - pptv range). We introduce a prototype that is capable of collecting samples of exhaled air according to the respiratory source and independent of the metabolic production of carbon dioxide. It also allows to access the breathing cycle in real-time, detects the optimized sampling instants and selects the collection pathway through the implementation of an algorithm containing a machine learning process. A graphical interface allows the interaction between the operator/user and the process of acquisition making it easy, quick and reliable. The imposition of breath rhythm led to improvements in accuracy of obtaining samples from specific parts of the respiratory tract and it should be adapted according to their age and physiological/health condition. The technology implemented in the proposed system should be taken into consideration for further studies, since the prototype is suitable for selectively sampling exhaled air from persons according to its age, genre and physiological condition.

TI  - Using Machine Learning to Evaluate Attending Feedback on Resident Performance
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND:High-quality and high-utility feedback allows for the development of improvement plans for trainees. The current manual assessment of the quality of this feedback is time consuming and subjective. We propose the use of machine learning to rapidly distinguish the quality of attending feedback on resident performance.METHODS:Using a preexisting databank of 1925 manually reviewed feedback comments from 4 anesthesiology residency programs, we trained machine learning models to predict whether comments contained 6 predefined feedback traits (actionable, behavior focused, detailed, negative feedback, professionalism/communication, and specific) and predict the utility score of the comment on a scale of 1-5. Comments with >= 4 feedback traits were classified as high-quality and comments with >= 4 utility scores were classified as high-utility; otherwise comments were considered low-quality or low-utility, respectively. We used RapidMiner Studio (RapidMiner, Inc, Boston, MA), a data science platform, to train, validate, and score performance of models.RESULTS:Models for predicting the presence of feedback traits had accuracies of 74.4%-82.2%. Predictions on utility category were 82.1% accurate, with 89.2% sensitivity, and 89.8% class precision for low-utility predictions. Predictions on quality category were 78.5% accurate, with 86.1% sensitivity, and 85.0% class precision for low-quality predictions. Fifteen to 20 hours were spent by a research assistant with no prior experience in machine learning to become familiar with software, create models, and review performance on predictions made. The program read data, applied models, and generated predictions within minutes. In contrast, a recent manual feedback scoring effort by an author took 15 hours to manually collate and score 200 comments during the course of 2 weeks.CONCLUSIONS:Harnessing the potential of machine learning allows for rapid assessment of attending feedback on resident performance. Using predictive models to rapidly screen for low-quality and low-utility feedback can aid programs in improving feedback provision, both globally and by individual faculty.

TI  - Machine learning approach to needle insertion site identification for spinal anesthesia in obese patients
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Ultrasonography for neuraxial anesthesia is increasingly being used to identify spinal structures and the identification of correct point of needle insertion to improve procedural success, in particular in obesity. We developed an ultrasound-guided automated spinal landmark identification program to assist anesthetists on spinal needle insertion point with a graphical user interface for spinal anesthesia.Methods: Forty-eight obese patients requiring spinal anesthesia for Cesarean section were recruited in this prospective cohort study. We utilized a developed machine learning algorithm to determine the needle insertion point using automated spinal landmark ultrasound imaging of the lumbar spine identifying the L3/4 interspinous space (longitudinal view) and the posterior complex of dura mater (transverse view). The demographic and clinical characteristics were also recorded.Results: The first attempt success rate for spinal anesthesia was 79.1% (38/48) (95%CI 65.0 - 89.5%), followed by successful second attempt of 12.5% (6/48), third attempt of 4.2% (2/48) and 4th attempt (4.2% or 2/48). The scanning duration of L3/4 interspinous space and the posterior complex were 21.0 [IQR: 17.0, 32.0] secs and 11.0 [IQR: 5.0, 22.0] secs respectively. There is good correlation between the program recorded depth of the skin to posterior complex and clinician measured depth (r = 0.915).Conclusions: The automated spinal landmark identification program is able to provide assistance to needle insertion point identification in obese patients. There is good correlation between program recorded and clinician measured depth of the skin to posterior complex of dura mater. Future research may involve imaging algorithm improvement to assist with needle insertion guidance during neuraxial anesthesia.

TI  - Comparison of Deep Learning Algorithms in Predicting Expert Assessments of Pain Scores during Surgical Operations Using Analgesia Nociception Index
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many surgical operations performed daily in operation rooms worldwide. Adequate anesthesia is needed during an operation. Besides hypnosis, adequate analgesia is critical to prevent autonomic reactions. Clinical experience and vital signs are usually used to adjust the dosage of analgesics. Analgesia nociception index (ANI), which ranges from 0 to 100, is derived from heart rate variability (HRV) via electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, for pain evaluation in a non-invasive manner. It represents parasympathetic activity. In this study, we compared the performance of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in predicting expert assessment of pain score (EAPS) based on patient ' s HRV during surgery. The objective of this study was to analyze how deep learning models differed from the medical doctors ' predictions of EAPS. As the input and output features of the deep learning models, the opposites of ANI and EAPS were used. This study included 80 patients who underwent operations at National Taiwan University Hospital. Using MLP and LSTM, a holdout method was first applied to 60 training patients, 10 validation patients, and 10 testing patients. As compared to the LSTM model, which had a testing mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.633 +/- 0.542, the MLP model had a testing MAE of 2.490 +/- 0.522, with a more appropriate shape of its prediction curves. The model based on MLP was selected as the best. Using MLP, a seven-fold cross validation method was then applied. The first fold had the lowest testing MAE of 2.460 +/- 0.634, while the overall MAE for the seven-fold cross validation method was 2.848 +/- 0.308. In conclusion, HRV analysis using MLP algorithm had a good correlation with EAPS; therefore, it can play role as a continuous monitor to predict intraoperative pain levels, to assist physicians in adjusting analgesic agent dosage. Further studies may consider obtaining more input features, such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and other kinds of continuous variable, to improve the prediction performance.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The goal of this K23 application is to provide Dr. Bishara with the necessary research experience andtime to establish himself as a primary investigator focused on designing and implementing machine learning(ML) and artificial intelligence in the perioperative setting. The career development activities in this applicationinclude early intensive course work in ML and statistics focused on improving model development and causalinference techniques. Then coursework focuses on clinical trial training, grantsmanship, responsible conduct ofresearch, and culminates in a course studying implementation science and algorithmic human-robot interaction.Augmenting this training are project-specific tutorials with experts to improve the models proposed in thisapplication with a focus on real-time prediction of perioperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and describing the risklandscape of perioperative AKI. To achieve these goals, Dr. Bishara has assembled a team of experts andmentors in the areas of data science, AKI, ML, and statistics. Dr. Atul Butte, his primary mentor, is an expert indata science and ML and has trained nearly 100 post-doctoral fellows, undergraduate and graduate students,and staff. Dr. Kathleen Liu is a thought leader in the field of AKI with an active research program focused on AKIand critical care clinical trials. She has mentored numerous junior faculty, including previous NIH K23 awardees.Dr. Romain Pirracchio is an expert in biostatistics and ML in acute care. He has collaborations with Berkeley andthe FDA and over 100 publications in the realm. These three mentors and the impressive team of advisors willguide Dr. Bishara to complete the project described below and to grow into an independent investigator. There has been a recent surge in the published literature on ML in medicine, and studies have shownpatient care improves when provider expertise is augmented by ML. Unfortunately, implementing published MLmodels to inform clinical care is not trivial, as many obstacles exist. This application focuses on exploring andovercoming those obstacles by implementing specific models in the perioperative setting. Dr. Bishara hasdeveloped novel ML visualization technology that allows for improved interactions between providers andmodels, which provide predictions and recommendations to those providers. This technology also allows forimproved regular monitoring and interpretation of the model to assure sustained accuracy and reliability. He willapply this new technology to predict perioperative AKI in real-time, building upon models he has developed.Postoperative AKI is a major public health problem affecting up to 47% of patients and is consistently associatedwith adverse outcomes, including, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), increased healthcare costs,and death. Randomized controlled trials show that implementation of kidney-protective strategies prevents AKIfor high-risk patients. Evidence suggests these strategies are underutilized as risk of AKI is often underestimatedin the perioperative setting. Dr. Bishara hypothesizes his ML models will identify those patients who will mostbenefit from timely kidney protective interventions at the time when preventative strategies can be initiated.

TI  - Anesthesia resuscitation object detection method based on improved single shot multibox detector
T2  - Journal of Computer Applications
M3  - Article
AB  - The target detection model of anesthesia resuscitation is often used to help medical staff to perform resuscitation detection on anesthetized patients. The targets of facial actions during patient resuscitation are small and are not obvious, and the existing Single Shot multibox Detector (SSD) is difficult to accurately detect the facial micro-action features of patients in real time. Aiming at the problem that the original model has low detection speed and is easy to have missed detection, an anesthesia resuscitation object detection method based on improved SSD was proposed. Firstly, the backbone network VGG (Visual Geometry Group)16 of the original SSD was replaced by the lightweight backbone network MobileNetV2, and the standard convolutions were replaced by the depthwise separable convolutions. At the same time, the calculation method of first increasing and then reducing the dimension of the extracted features from patient photos was used to reduce computational cost, thereby improving detection speed of the model. Secondly, the Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism was integrated into the feature layers with different scales extracted by the SSD, and the ability of the feature map to extract key information was improved by weighting the channel and location information, so that the network positioning and classification performance was optimized. Finally, comparative experiments were carried out on three datasets: CEW (Closed Eyes in the Wild), LFW(Labeled Faces in the Wild), and HAPF(Hospital Anesthesia Patient Facial). Experimental results show that the mean Average Precision (AP) of the proposed model reaches 95.23%, and the detection rate of photos is 24 frames per second, which are 1.39 percentage points higher and 140% higher than those of the original SSD model respectively. Therefore, the improved model has the effect of real-time accurate detection in anesthesia resuscitation detection, and can assist medical staff in resuscitation detection.

TI  - Ultrasound Image-Guided Nerve Block Combined with General Anesthesia under an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm on Patients Undergoing Radical Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer during and after Operation (Retracted Article)
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - This study was aimed at investigating the location of gastric cancer by using a gastroscope image based on an artificial intelligence algorithm for gastric cancer and the effect of ultrasonic-guided nerve block combined with general anesthesia on patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery. A total of 160 patients who were undergoing gastric cancer surgery from March 2019 to March 2021 were collected as the research objects, and the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used to segment the gastroscope image of gastric cancer. The patients were randomly divided into a simple general anesthesia group of 80 cases and a transversus abdominis plane block combined with rectus abdominis sheath block combined with the general anesthesia group of 80 cases. Then, compare the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) at the four time points T-0, T-1, T-2, and T-3. The times of analgesic drug use within 48 hours after operation and postoperative adverse reactions were recorded. The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were also recorded at 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. The results show that the image quality after segmentation is good: the accuracy of tumor location is 75.67%, which is similar to that of professional endoscopists. Compared with the general anesthesia group, the transversus abdominis plane block combined with the rectus sheath block combined with the general anesthesia group had fewer anesthetics, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Compared with the general anesthesia group, SBP, DBP, and HR were significantly reduced at T-1, T-2, and T-3 in the transverse abdominis plane block combined with rectus sheath block and general anesthesia group (P < 0.05). Compared with the simple general anesthesia group, the VAS scores of the transversus abdominis plane block combined with rectus sheath block combined with the general anesthesia group decreased at 4 h, 12 h, and 24 h after surgery, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The number of analgesics used in transversus abdominis plane block combined with the rectus sheath block combined with the general anesthesia group within 48 hours after operation was significantly less than that in the general anesthesia group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The average incidence of adverse reactions in the nerve block combined with the general anesthesia group was 2.5%, which was lower than the average incidence of 3.75% in the general anesthesia group. In summary, the CNN algorithm can accurately segment the lesions in the ultrasonic images of gastric cancer, which was convenient for doctors to make a more accurate judgment on the lesions, and provided a basis for the preoperative examination of radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Ultrasonic-guided nerve block combined with general anesthesia can effectively improve the analgesic effect of radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer, reduced intraoperative and postoperative adverse reactions and analgesic drug dosage, and had a good effect on postoperative recovery of patients. The combined application of these two methods can further improve the precision treatment of gastric cancer patients and accelerate postoperative recovery.

TI  - Effects of pain, sedation and delirium monitoring on clinical and economic outcome: A retrospective study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSignificant improvements in clinical outcome can be achieved by implementing effective strategies to optimise pain management, reduce sedative exposure, and prevent and treat delirium in ICU patients. One important strategy is the monitoring of pain, agitation and delirium (PAD bundle). We hypothesised that there is no sufficient financial benefit to implement a monitoring strategy in a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)-based reimbursement system, therefore we expected better clinical and decreased economic outcome for monitored patients.MethodsThis is a retrospective observational study using routinely collected data. We used univariate and multiple linear analysis, machine-learning analysis and a novel correlation statistic (maximal information coefficient) to explore the association between monitoring adherence and resulting clinical and economic outcome. For univariate analysis we split patients in an adherence achieved and an adherence non-achieved group.ResultsIn total 1,323 adult patients from two campuses of a German tertiary medical centre, who spent at least one day in the ICU between admission and discharge between 1. January 2016 and 31. December 2016. Adherence to PAD monitoring was associated with shorter hospital LoS (e.g. pain monitoring 13 vs. 10 days; p<0.001), ICU LoS, duration of mechanical ventilation shown by univariate analysis. Despite the improved clinical outcome, adherence to PAD elements was associated with a decreased case mix per day and profit per day shown by univariate analysis. Multiple linear analysis did not confirm these results. PAD monitoring is important for clinical as well as economic outcome and predicted case mix better than severity of illness shown by machine learning analysis.ConclusionAdherence to PAD bundles is also important for clinical as well as economic outcome. It is associated with improved clinical and worse economic outcome in comparison to non-adherence in univariate analysis but not confirmed by multiple linear analysis.

TI  - Predictors of emergency department opioid administration and prescribing: A machine learning approach
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The opioid epidemic has altered normative clinical perceptions on addressing both acute and chronic pain, particularly within the Emergency Department (ED) setting, where providers are now confronted with balancing pain management and potential abuse. This study aims to examine patient sociodemographic and ED clinical characteristics to comprehensively determine predictors of opioid administration during an ED visit (ED-RX) and prescribing upon discharge (DC-RX). Methods: ED visit data of patients >= 18 years old from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2014 to 2017 were used. Opioid prescriptions were determined utilizing Lexicon narcotic drug classifications. Visit characteristics studied included sociodemographic variables, and ED clinical variables, such as chief complaint, and discharge diagnosis. Machine learning methods were used to determine predictors of ED-RX and DC-RX and weighted logistic regressions were performed using selected predictors. Results: Of the 44,227 ED visits identified, patients tended to be female (57.4%), and White (74.2%) with an average age of 46.4 years (SE = 0.3). Weighted proportions of ED-RX and DC-RX were 23.2% and 18.9%, respectively. The strongest predictors of ED-RX were CT scan ordered (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.84-2.58), abdominal pain (OR = 1.93, 95% CI:1.59-2.34) and back pain (OR = 1.81, 95% CI:1.45-2.27). Tooth pain (OR = 6.94, 95% CI = 4.40-10.94) and fracture injury diagnoses (OR = 3.76, 95% CI = 2.72-5.19) were the strongest predictors of DC-RX. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the utility of machine learning for understanding clinical predictors of opioid administration and prescribing in the ED, and its potential in informing standardized prescribing recommendations and guidelines.

TI  - The Lifetime History of the First Italian Public Extra-Corporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) Lithotripter as a Mirror of the Evolution of Endourology over the Last Decade.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the only non-invasive treatment for kidney stones. It does not require an operating room, anesthesia, or hospital stay. Its role evolved over the years and nowadays ESWL is slowly disappearing from many stone centers and urologic departments. We present the history and the role of ESWL treatment since its birth in 1959 and its development through the following years. We also present details of its application and impact on the first Italian stone center in 1985. ESWL has had different roles over the centuries: in the early years it was a great alternative to open surgery and percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL), then it had its decline with the introduction of the miniscopes. Currently, although ESWL is not considered a treatment of excellence, newer models are emerging. With the application of new technologies and artificial intelligence, this technique can become a good option alongside endourologic treatments.

TI  - ERAS protocol for pediatric laparoscopic cholecystectomy promotes safe and early discharge
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) pediatric patients in our institution have historically been admitted for an overnight hospital stay (OHS). The purpose of this study was to implement an ERAS protocol for elective LC in pediatric patients to promote same-day discharge (SDD) while maintaining excellent outcomes.Methods: An ERAS protocol for elective LC was implemented encompassing pre-, perk and postoperative management. A retrospective review of prospectively collected data from patients before (BI) and after implementation (AI) of the protocol was performed.Results: A total of 250 patients (BI 105, AI 145) were included in the study. The AI group had significantly higher rate of SDD compared to BI (77.2% vs. 1.9%, p < <0.01) and significantly decreased opioid use (morphine equivalents mg/kg AI 0.36 vs. BI 0.46, p < <0.001). There were also no significant differences in the rate of total 30-day emergency department visits (BI 11.4% vs. AI 9.7%, p = 0.52) or surgery-related 30-day emergency department visits (BI 7.6% vs. AI 8.3%, p = 0.53). Factors that predisposed patients to an OHS after LC included higher ASA, later surgery start times, and longer operative times.Conclusions: The ERAS protocol significantly increased the rate of SDD after elective LC in pediatric patients without an associated increase in emergency department visits or readmissions.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the effect of intelligentized patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) management on the quality of postoperative analgesia in the patients. Methods A total of 6 601 patients who underwent postoperative PCA from January 1, 2015 to December 31,2017 searched from the intelligentized PCA system database were selected as intelligentized PCA management group (I group),and then were divided into 3 subgroups according to the year: 2015 subgroup (n = 2 221), 2016 subgroup (n = 2 152) and 2017 subgroup (n = 2 228). A total of 1 235 patients who underwent PCA which was mainly performed by a department of anesthesiology in the postoperative analgesia-related multi-center questionnaire from April 11, 2016 to April 22,2016 in 12 grade A tertiary hospitals in Guangdong Province were selected as the traditional PCA management group (C group). The development of moderate and severe pain, nausea and vomiting, over-sedation at rest and during activity and patient's satisfaction were recorded on 1st and 2nd days after operation. Results Compared with C group,the incidence of moderate and severe pain, nausea and vomiting and over-sedation at rest and during activity was significantly decreased, and the rate of patient's satisfaction was increased at each time point after operation in I group (P<0.05 or 0.01). Compared with 2015 subgroup, the incidence of moderate and severe pain at rest and severe pain during activity was significantly decreased in 2016 and 2017 subgroups (P<0.05 or 0.01),and the incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly increased in 2017 subgroup (P<0.05). Compared with 2016 subgroup, the incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly increased in 2017 subgroup (P<0.05). Conclusion Intelligentized PCA management can improve the efficacy of PCA,mitigates the occurrence of adverse reactions and raise the quality of postoperative analgesia in the patients.

TI  - Con: Artificial Intelligence-Derived Algorithms to Guide Perioperative Blood Management Decision Making
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial intelligence has the potential to improve the care that is given to patients; however, the predictive models created are only as good as the base data used in their design. Perioperative blood management presents a complex clinical conundrum in which significant variability and the unstructured nature of the required data make it difficult to develop precise prediction models. There is a potential need for training clinicians to ensure they can interrogate the system and override when errors occur. Current systems created to predict perioperative blood transfusion are not generalizable across clinical settings, and there is a considerable cost implication required to research and develop artificial intelligence systems that would disadvantage resource-poor health systems. In addition, a lack of strong regulation currently means it is difficult to prevent bias. Crown Copyright (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-range temporal correlations in the brain distinguish conscious wakefulness from induced unconsciousness
T2  - NEUROIMAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rhythmic neuronal synchronization across large-scale networks is thought to play a key role in the regulation of conscious states. Changes in neuronal oscillation amplitude across states of consciousness have been widely reported, but little is known about possible changes in the temporal dynamics of these oscillations. The temporal structure of brain oscillations may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness. To address this question, we examined long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of EEG oscillation amplitudes recorded during both wakefulness and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Importantly, the time-varying EEG oscillation envelopes were assessed over the course of a sevoflurane sedation protocol during which the participants alternated between states of consciousness and unconsciousness. Both spectral power and LRTC in oscillation amplitude were computed across multiple frequency bands. State-dependent differences in these features were assessed using non-parametric tests and supervised machine learning. We found that periods of unconsciousness were associated with increases in LRTC in beta (15-30Hz) amplitude over frontocentral channels and with a suppression of alpha (8-13Hz) amplitude over occipitoparietal electrodes. Moreover, classifiers trained to predict states of consciousness on single epochs demonstrated that the combination of beta LRTC with alpha amplitude provided the highest classification accuracy (above 80%). These results suggest that loss of consciousness is accompanied by an augmentation of temporal persistence in neuronal oscillation amplitude, which may reflect an increase in regularity and a decrease in network repertoire compared to the brain's activity during resting-state consciousness.

TI  - Different Machine Learning Approaches for Implementing Telehealth-Based Cancer Pain Management Strategies
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The most effective strategy for managing cancer pain remotely should be better defined. There is a need to identify those patients who require increased attention and calibrated follow-up programs. Methods: Machine learning (ML) models were developed using the data prospectively obtained from a single-center program of telemedicine-based cancer pain management. These models included random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), artificial neural network (ANN), and the LASSO-RIDGE algorithm. Thirteen demographic, social, clinical, and therapeutic variables were adopted to define the conditions that can affect the number of teleconsultations. After ML validation, the risk analysis for more than one remote consultation was assessed in target individuals. Results: The data from 158 patients were collected. In the training set, the accuracy was about 95% and 98% for ANN and RF, respectively. Nevertheless, the best accuracy on the test set was obtained with RF (70%). The ML-based simulations showed that young age (<55 years), lung cancer, and occurrence of breakthrough cancer pain help to predict the number of remote consultations. Elderly patients (>75 years) with bone metastases may require more telemedicine-based clinical evaluations. Conclusion: ML-based analyses may enable clinicians to identify the best model for predicting the need for more remote consultations. It could be useful for calibrating care interventions and resource allocation.

TI  - System for confirming type of ventilation airway            device during anesthesia procedure on pediatric            patient, has processor for transmitting alert signal to            generator if type of airway device and mechanical            device selection are determined
AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The system has a processor (20) for receiving                monitored respiratory parameters. The processor                identifies a type of a mechanical ventilation                airway device by applying machine-learning data                mining algorithm to the respiratory parameters,                determines consistency of the identified type of                the mechanical ventilation airway device and the                mechanical ventilation airway device selection, and                transmits an alert signal to an alert generator                (40) if the identified type of the mechanical                ventilation airway device and the mechanical                ventilation airway device selection are determined                to be inconsistent.
                    USE - System for confirming a type of a mechanical                ventilation airway device e.g. mask and laryngeal                mask airway (LMA) or endotracheal tube (ETT) device                used during an anesthesia procedure on a pediatric                patient.
                    ADVANTAGE - The system improves clinical monitoring of                documentation systems by reducing alert fatigue to                increase smaller and weak decision trees prediction                and classification accuracy and robustness, thus                addressing bias-variance dilemma in designing of                classifier. The system outputs classifier by                increasing size of neural network and suppressing                resulting variance, thus calculating average for                connecting weights of neural network. The system                reduces cost and time consumption.

TI  - Validation of Random Forest Machine Learning Models to Predict Dementia-Related Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Real-World Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are the leading cause of the social burden of dementia but their role is underestimated.Objective: The objective of the study was to validate predictive models to separately identify psychotic and depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed with dementia using clinical databases representing the whole population to inform decision-makers.Methods: First, we searched the electronic health records of 4,003 patients with dementia to identify NPS. Second, machine learning (random forest) algorithms were applied to build separate predictive models for psychotic and depressive symptom clusters in the training set (N = 3,003). Third, calibration and discrimination were assessed in the test set (N = 1,000) to assess the performance of the models.Results: Neuropsychiatric symptoms were noted in the electronic health record of 58% of patients. The area under the receiver operating curve reached 0.80 for the psychotic cluster model and 0.74 for the depressive cluster model. The Kappa index and accuracy also showed better discrimination in the psychotic model. Calibration plots indicated that both types of model had less predictive accuracy when the probability of neuropsychiatric symptoms was <25%. The most important variables in the psychotic cluster model were use of risperidone, level of sedation, use of quetiapine and haloperidol and the number of antipsychotics prescribed. In the depressive cluster model, the most important variables were number of antidepressants prescribed, escitalopram use, level of sedation, and age.Conclusion: Given their relatively good performance, the predictive models can be used to estimate prevalence of NPS in population databases.

T2  - Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine in Intensive and Critical Care
M3  - Review
AB  - Critical care medicine is an important component of clinical medicine, including multiple aspects such as screening, monitoring, treatment, and rehabilitation of the critical illness. With the formation of the critical care discipline system and the updating of rehabilitation medicine concepts, the early rehabilitation of critically ill patients has become a clinical concern. More and more evidence suggests that moderate sedation, early activity, and exercise in critically ill patients have a positive impact on cognitive function, physical function, mental health, and quality of life. Based on comprehensive rehabilitation assessment, following contraindications and indications, and appropriate and personalized rehabilitation treatment techniques are the key points. Combining artificial intelligence and information technology to assist rehabilitation may be the future development direction. However, there are still problems and obstacles in clinical practice such as low accessibility and uneven management of critical care rehabilitation. Therefore, by reviewing relevant literature on critical care rehabilitation in recent years, this article summarizes the evolution of critical care rehabilitation concepts, the composition and workflow of the multidisciplinary rehabilitation team, indications and contraindications, evaluation and commonly used technologies, the application of artificial intelligence, obstacles and countermeasures for carrying out critical care rehabilitation from the perspective of evaluation and treatment. To provide reference for the early clinical implementation of critical care rehabilitation.

AB  - ABSTRACTSurgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impairrecovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Literaturesuggests significant disparities exist with regard to pain management and its quality-of-life impacts, particularlyamong vulnerable populations (e.g. depressed, obese and diabetics). However, there lacks risk stratificationtools to identify individuals at high risk for these disparate pain outcomes. Although pain scores are routinelycollected in electronic health records (EHRs), shared algorithms to utilize them for care improvement are limited.To advance the efficient and effective use of the abundant amount of electronic data now available, a commondata model (CDM) is necessary: standardized structures, terminologies, and rules to represent EHR data. Usinga CMD for postoperative pain research would facilitate timely evidence generation across multiple populationsand settings, which can provide critical evidence to stakeholders and move the field away from pain treatmentfor the ‘average’ patient to pain treatment for an individual. In this grant, we propose an innovative approach toadvance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain across populations. Our approach will leverage theObservational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to develop tools that use standardize data formatsand naming conventions; OMOP has over 140 collaborating sites gloablly. We will further utilize analytical toolsdeveloped by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) on this CDM to facilitate disseminateacross the research community. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools foradverse pain outcomes across diverse populations. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we willdevelop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperativepain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deeplearning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our modelsexternally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This projectwill deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify patients at high risk foradverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in thecommunity– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic.

TI  - Acupuncture versus medication for pain management: a cross-sectional study of breast cancer survivors
T2  - ACUPUNCTURE IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of the study Breast cancer survivors who take aromatase inhibitors (AI) often suffer from chronic pain. Emerging evidence supports the use of acupuncture as an effective pain management strategy for this condition, but its acceptability among cancer survivors is unknown. We evaluated breast cancer survivors' preferences for acupuncture as compared with medication use and identified factors predictive of this preference.Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among breast cancer survivors who were currently, or had been, taking an AI. The primary outcome was degree of preference for acupuncture as compared with medication for pain management. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to evaluate the effects of socioeconomic status (SES) factors and health beliefs on treatment preference.Results Among 592 participants, 160 (27.0%) preferred acupuncture, 153 (25.8%) preferred medication and 279 (47.1%) had no clear preference. In a multivariate analysis that only included SES, higher education and white race were significantly associated with greater preference for acupuncture. When health beliefs were added, SES effects were attenuated, while greater expectation of acupuncture's effect, lower perceived barriers to its use, higher social norm (endorsement from family members and healthcare professionals) related to acupuncture and higher holistic health beliefs were associated with greater preference for acupuncture.Conclusion We found similar rates of preference for acupuncture versus medication among breast cancer survivors for pain management. Specific attitudes and beliefs predicted such preferences, highlighting the importance of a patient-centred approach to align patient beliefs and preferences with therapeutic options for more effective pain management.Trial registration numberNCT01013337; Results.

TI  - Construction of prediction models for prolonged length of postoperative hospital stay in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy
T2  - Chinese Journal of Anesthesiology
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To construct the prediction model for the prolonged length of postoperative hospital stay in the patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy. Methods The patients of both sexes, aged ≥ 18 yr, of American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification I - III , who received elective thoracoscopic lobectomy with general anesthesia from March 2016 to February 2019 in our hospital, were selected, their clinical data were collected, and the patients were pathologically diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer after operation. Basic information (sex, age, smoking history) , previous history (dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases,peripheral vascular diseases,chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) , allergy history, other tumor history, surgical resection site,anesthetic factors (intraoperative use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and glucocorticoids, duration of anesthesia, intraoperative epidural anesthesia + postoperative epidural analgesia) and postoperative complications (pleural effusion, pneumothorax,atelectasis) was collected. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether the length of postoperative hospital stay was prolonged : normal group (≤7 days) and prolonged group (>7 days). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictors for prolonged length of postoperative hospital stay. The regression model for prediction of prolonged length of postoperative hospital stay was constructed based on the TensorFlow deep learning framework, and the efficacy of prediction was evaluated. A deep neural network was further established based on the TensorFlow framework to construct a classification prediction model for prolonged length of postoperative hospital stay, and the efficacy of prediction was assessed, further comparing it with the prediction model constructed by the traditional machine learning method. Results A total of 428 patients were finally enrolled in the study. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age and anesthesia duration were the risk factors for the prolonged length of postoperative hospital stay,and female,other tumor history and resection of right middle lobe were the protective factors (P<0.05). The performance of the regression model proved ineffective, getting 2.16 mean absolute error and 11.05 mean square error on the training set, 2.14 mean absolute error and 11.73 mean square error on the test set. The classification model achieved better score with accuracy 75.58% , F1-measure 0.553 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.702 on the test set, however, it showed no better performance than that of 4 other prediction models established by 4 traditional machine learning methods, specifically Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Machine. Conclusions Sex,age,surgical resection site,other tumor history and duration of anesthesia can serve as the predictors,and a classification prediction model for prolonged length of postoperative hospital stay is constructed based on a deep neural network in the patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy.

TI  - Handheld ultrasound system for real-time thoracic epidural analgesia guidance
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT NARRATIVE Thoracic epidural analgesia is the current standard of care for postoperative pain management following thoracic or abdominal surgery. Failures occur at high rates due to a reliance on manual palpation of bone landmarks to guide needle placement, which results in numerous adverse events: incomplete analgesia, increased mortality, higher pain scores, headache, dural puncture, back pain, parathesia, and paralysis. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate a portable, low-cost, ultrasound-based medical device that facilitates thoracic epidural placement, improves success rates, and lowers the risk of associated health complications.

M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Decision support systems based on reinforcement learning (RL) have been implemented to facilitate the delivery of personalized care. This paper aimed to provide a comprehensive review of RL applications in the critical care setting.Objective: This review aimed to survey the literature on RL applications for clinical decision support in critical care and to provide insight into the challenges of applying various RL models.Methods: We performed an extensive search of the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE). Studies published over the past 10 years (2010-2019) that have applied RL for critical care were included.Results: We included 21 papers and found that RL has been used to optimize the choice of medications, drug dosing, and timing of interventions and to target personalized laboratory values. We further compared and contrasted the design of the RL models and the evaluation metrics for each application.Conclusions: RL has great potential for enhancing decision making in critical care. Challenges regarding RL system design, evaluation metrics, and model choice exist. More importantly, further work is required to validate RL in authentic clinical environments.

T2  - IEEE SENSORS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Contactless monitoring using thermal imaging has become increasingly proposed to monitor patient deterioration in hospital, most recently to detect fevers and infections during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this letter, we propose a novel method to estimate patient motion and observe clinical workload using a similar technical setup but combined with open-source object detection algorithms (YOLOv4) and optical flow. Patient motion estimation was used to approximate patient agitation and sedation, while worker motion was used as a surrogate for caregiver workload. Performance was illustrated by comparing over 32 000 frames from the videos of patients recorded in an intensive care unit to clinical agitation scores recorded by clinical workers.

CP  - 6th International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions (IPCAI)
CL  - Barcelona, SPAIN
AB  - Injection therapy is a commonly used solution for back pain management. This procedure typically involves percutaneous insertion of a needle between or around the vertebrae, to deliver anesthetics near nerve bundles. Most frequently, spinal injections are performed either blindly using palpation or under the guidance of fluoroscopy or computed tomography. Recently, due to the drawbacks of the ionizing radiation of such imaging modalities, there has been a growing interest in using ultrasound imaging as an alternative. However, the complex spinal anatomy with different wave-like structures, affected by speckle noise, makes the accurate identification of the appropriate injection plane difficult. The aim of this study was to propose an automated system that can identify the optimal plane for epidural steroid injections and facet joint injections.A multi-scale and multi-directional feature extraction system to provide automated identification of the appropriate plane is proposed. Local Hadamard coefficients are obtained using the sequency-ordered Hadamard transform at multiple scales. Directional features are extracted from local coefficients which correspond to different regions in the ultrasound images. An artificial neural network is trained based on the local directional Hadamard features for classification.The proposed method yields distinctive features for classification which successfully classified 1032 images out of 1090 for epidural steroid injection and 990 images out of 1052 for facet joint injection. In order to validate the proposed method, a leave-one-out cross-validation was performed. The average classification accuracy for leave-one-out validation was 94 % for epidural and 90 % for facet joint targets. Also, the feature extraction time for the proposed method was 20 ms for a native 2D ultrasound image.A real-time machine learning system based on the local directional Hadamard features extracted by the sequency-ordered Hadamard transform for detecting the laminae and facet joints in ultrasound images has been proposed. The system has the potential to assist the anesthesiologists in quickly finding the target plane for epidural steroid injections and facet joint injections.

TI  - Development of machine learning models to predict posterior capsule rupture based on the EUREQUO registry
T2  - ACTA OPHTHALMOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo evaluate the performance of different probabilistic classifiers to predict posterior capsule rupture (PCR) prior to cataract surgery. MethodsThree probabilistic classifiers were constructed to estimate the probability of PCR: a Bayesian network (BN), logistic regression (LR) model, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. The classifiers were trained on a sample of 2 853 376 surgeries reported to the European Registry of Quality Outcomes for Cataract and Refractive Surgery (EUREQUO) between 2008 and 2018. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated based on the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and compared to existing scoring models in the literature. Furthermore, direct risk factors for PCR were identified by analysing the independence structure of the BN. ResultsThe MLP network predicted PCR overall the best (AUPRC 13.1 +/- 0.41%), followed by the BN (AUPRC 8.05 +/- 0.39%) and the LR model (AUPRC 7.31 +/- 0.15%). Direct risk factors for PCR include preoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), year of surgery, operation type, anaesthesia, target refraction, other ocular comorbidities, white cataract, and corneal opacities. ConclusionsOur results suggest that the MLP network performs better than existing scoring models in the literature, despite a relatively low precision at high recall. Consequently, implementing the MLP network in clinical practice can potentially decrease the PCR rate.

TI  - Clinical relevance of deep learning models in predicting the onset timing of cancer pain exacerbation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancer pain is a challenging clinical problem that is encountered in the management of cancer pain. We aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of deep learning models that predict the onset of cancer pain exacerbation in hospitalized patients. We defined cancer pain exacerbation (CPE) as the pain with a numerical rating scale (NRS) score of & GE; 4. We investigated the performance of the deep learning models using the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) with different input lengths and time binning. All the pain records were obtained from the electronic medical records of the hematology-oncology wards in a Samsung Medical Center between July 2016 and February 2020. The model was externally validated using the holdout method with 20% of the datasets. The most common type of cancer was lung cancer (n = 745, 21.7%), and the median CPE per day was 1.01. The NRS pain records showed circadian patterns that correlated with NRS pain patterns of the previous days. The correlation of the NRS scores showed a positive association with the closeness of the NRS pattern of the day with forecast date and size of time binning. The long short-term memory-based model exhibited a good performance by demonstrating 9 times the best performance and 8 times the second-best performance among 21 different settings. The best performance was achieved with 120 h input and 12 h bin lengths (MCC: 0.4927). Our study demonstrated the possibility of predicting CPE using deep learning models, thereby suggesting that preemptive cancer pain management using deep learning could potentially improve patients' daily life.

TI  - The burden of dental care in Amelogenesis Imperfecta paediatric patients in the UK NHS: a retrospective, multi-centred analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF PAEDIATRIC DENTISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The burden of dental care in Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) has not been well described. This condition results in weak, discoloured and often sensitive teeth. Specialist paediatric care is available for AI patients in the UK, but treatment protocols and care provided are inconsistent. The aim of this study was therefore to analyse the provision of treatment and burden of care for children and families with AI across four Paediatric Dentistry centres in the UK.Methods A retrospective evaluation of AI patient clinical records across four UK consultant-led Paediatric Dentistry centres was completed. Frequency and duration of care were recorded along with treatment and experience of inhalation sedation, local and general anaesthetic.Results In total, 138 records were available for analysis. The average patient age at first referral was 7.7 years (range 1-16 years) and families travelled an average 21.8 miles per appointment (range 0.2-286 miles). Patients attended on average 4.5 appointments per year for 5.8 years. In total, 65.2% had experience of local anaesthetic, 27.5% inhalation sedation and 31.9% general anaesthetic. Dental treatment including restorations and extractions were commonly required on multiple teeth per patient.Conclusion AI carries a high burden of specialist dental care to patients and families. Specialist centres are required to provide longitudinal, comprehensive care.

TI  - Effect of PEEP, Zero PEEP and Intraabdominal Pressure Levels on Cerebral Oxygenation in the Morbidly Obese Undergoing Sleeve Gastrectomy
T2  - BARIATRIC SURGICAL PRACTICE AND PATIENT CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study is designed to determine the effect of zero end expiratory pressure (ZEEP) and 5mmHg positive end expiratory pressure (5PEEP) on cerebral oxymeter (CO) levels in morbidly obese (MO) patients. Study was performed on 60 morbidly obese patients between 18-60 years old, American Society of Anesthesiology 2-3 status, scheduled to undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy under general anesthesia. The patients were divided into two groups: those ventilated with no PEEP (group ZEEP, n = 30) and those ventilated with 5 cmH(2)O PEEP levels (group 5PEEP, n = 28). rSO(2) values were measured. Data were recorded as basal, after the induction (A ind) of anesthesia, 5 min before insufflation (BI), 5 min after insufflation (AI), 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after induction, 5 min before desufflation, and 5 min after desufflation (AD). Invasive arterial pressures, CO values, peripheral oxygen saturation, end tidal carbondioxide, and intraabdominal pressure (IAP) were recorded in these time periods in all groups. Arterial blood samples were analyzed in terms of the 5BI, 5AI, and 5AD periods. There was a negative correlation between IAP and left CO on pneumoperitoneum time in group 5PEEP. Correlation was observed between bilateral CO values and ideal body weight (IBW), lean body weight (LBW), body surface area BSA, in group ZEEP. Correlation was observed between IBW, LBW, and right CO values in group 5PEEP. PEEP application may have a protective effect on cerebral oxygenation.

TI  - Mapping the Design Space of Technology-Based Solutions for Better Chronic Pain Care: Introducing the Pain Tech Landscape
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Technology has substantial potential to transform and extend care for persons with chronic pain, a burdensome and costly condition. To catalyze the development of impactful applications of technology in this space, we developed the Pain Tech Landscape (PTL) model, which integrates pain care needs with characteristics of technological solutions. Methods: Our interdisciplinary group representing experts in pain and human factors research developed PTL through iterative discussions. To demonstrate one potential use of the model, we apply data generated from a narrative review of selected pain and technology journals (2000-2020) in the form of heat map overlays, to reveal where pain tech research attention has focused to date. Results: The PTL comprises three two-dimensional planes, with pain care needs on each x axis (measurement to management) and technology applications on the y axes according to a) user agency (user- to system-driven), b) usage time frame (temporary to lifelong), and c) collaboration (single-user to collaborative). Heat maps show that existing applications reside primarily in the "user-driven/management" quadrant (e.g., self-care apps). Examples of less developed areas include artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (i.e., Internet-linked household objects), and collaborative/social tools for pain management. Conclusions: Collaborative development between the pain and tech fields in early developmental stages using the PTL as a common language could yield impactful solutions for chronic pain management. The PTL could also be used to track developments in the field over time. We encourage periodic reassessment and refinement of the PTL model, which can also be adapted to other chronic conditions.

TI  - Hypotension Prediction Index guided Goal Directed therapy and the amount of Hypotension during Major Gynaecologic Oncologic Surgery: a Randomized Controlled clinical Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) is a machine learning derived algorithm that predicts IOH shortly before it occurs. We tested the hypothesis that the application of the HPI in combination with a pre-defined Goal Directed Therapy (GDT) hemodynamic protocol reduces IOH during major gynaecologic oncologic surgery. We enrolled women scheduled for major gynaecologic oncologic surgery under general anesthesia with invasive arterial pressure monitoring. Patients were randomized to a GDT protocol aimed at optimizing stroke volume index (SVI) or hemodynamic management based on HPI guidance in addition to GDT. The primary outcome was the amount of IOH, defined as the timeweighted average (TWA) mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 65 mmHg. Secondary outcome was the TWA-MAP < 65 mmHg during the first 20 min after induction of GA. After exclusion of 10 patients the final analysis included 60 patients (30 in each group). The median (25-75th IQR) TWA-MAP < 65 mmHg was 0.14 (0.04-0.66) mmHg in HPI group versus 0.77 (0.36-1.30) mmHg in Control group, P < 0.001. During the first 20 min after induction of GA, the median TWA-MAP < 65 mmHg was 0.53 (0.06-1.8) mmHg in the HPI group and 2.15 (0.65-4.2) mmHg in the Control group, P = 0.001. Compared to a GDT protocol aimed to SVI optimization, a machine learning-derived algorithm for prediction of IOH combined with a GDT hemodynamic protocol, reduced IOH and hypotension after induction of general anesthesia in patients undergoing major gynaecologic oncologic surgery.Trial registration number: NCT04547491.

AB  - Simple Summary Pain causes behavioral, autonomic and neuroendocrine changes and is a common cause of animal welfare compromise in farm animals. These recommendations focus on cattle, sheep, and pigs, and present the implications of unmanaged pain in terms of animal welfare and ethical perspectives, and its challenges and misconceptions. We provide an overview of pain management including assessment and treatment applied to the most common husbandry procedures, and recommendations to improve animal welfare in these species. Pain causes behavioral, autonomic, and neuroendocrine changes and is a common cause of animal welfare compromise in farm animals. Current societal and ethical concerns demand better agricultural practices and improved welfare for food animals. These guidelines focus on cattle, sheep, and pigs, and present the implications of pain in terms of animal welfare and ethical perspectives, and its challenges and misconceptions. We provide an overview of pain management including assessment and treatment applied to the most common husbandry procedures, and recommendations to improve animal welfare in these species. A cost-benefit analysis of pain mitigation is discussed for food animals as well as the use of pain scoring systems for pain assessment in these species. Several recommendations are provided related to husbandry practices that could mitigate pain and improve farm animal welfare. This includes pain assessment as one of the indicators of animal welfare, the use of artificial intelligence for automated methods and research, and the need for better/appropriate legislation, regulations, and recommendations for pain relief during routine and husbandry procedures.

TI  - MAB-DrNet: Bearing Fault Diagnosis Method Based on an Improved Dilated Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rolling bearing fault diagnosis is of great significance to the safe and reliable operation of manufacturing equipment. In the actual complex environment, the collected bearing signals usually contain a large amount of noises from the resonances of the environment and other components, resulting in the nonlinear characteristics of the collected data. Existing deep-learning-based solutions for bearing fault diagnosis perform poorly in classification performance under noises. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an improved dilated-convolutional-neural network-based bearing fault diagnosis method in noisy environments named MAB-DrNet. First, a basic model called the dilated residual network (DrNet) was designed based on the residual block to enlarge the model's perceptual field to better capture the features from bearing fault signals. Then, a max-average block (MAB) module was designed to improve the feature extraction capability of the model. In addition, the global residual block (GRB) module was introduced into MAB-DrNet to further improve the performance of the proposed model, enabling the model to better handle the global information of the input data and improve the classification accuracy of the model in noisy environments. Finally, the proposed method was tested on the CWRU dataset, and the results showed that the proposed method had good noise immunity; the accuracy was 95.57% when adding Gaussian white noises with a signal-to-noise ratio of -6 dB. The proposed method was also compared with existing advanced methods to further prove its high accuracy.

TI  - Automated Smart Home Assessment to Support Pain Management: Multiple Methods Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Poorly managed pain can lead to substance use disorders, depression, suicide, worsening health, and increased use of health services. Most pain assessments occur in clinical settings away from patients' natural environments. Advances in smart home technology may allow observation of pain in the home setting. Smart homes recognizing human behaviors may be useful for quantifying functional pain interference, thereby creating new ways of assessing pain and supporting people living with pain.Objective: This study aimed to determine if a smart home can detect pain-related behaviors to perform automated assessment and support intervention for persons with chronic pain.Methods: A multiple methods, secondary data analysis was conducted using historic ambient sensor data and weekly nursing assessment data from 11 independent older adults reporting pain across 1-2 years of smart home monitoring. A qualitative approach was used to interpret sensor-based data of 27 unique pain events to support clinician-guided training of a machine learning model. A periodogram was used to calculate circadian rhythm strength, and a random forest containing 100 trees was employed to train a machine learning model to recognize pain-related behaviors. The model extracted 550 behavioral markers for each sensor-based data segment. These were treated as both a binary classification problem (event, control) and a regression problem.Results: We found 13 clinically relevant behaviors, revealing 6 pain-related behavioral qualitative themes. Quantitative results were classified using a clinician-guided random forest technique that yielded a classification accuracy of 0.70, sensitivity of 0.72, specificity of 0.69, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.756, and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.777 in comparison to using standard anomaly detection techniques without clinician guidance (0.16 accuracy achieved; P<.001). The regression formulation achieved moderate correlation, with r=0.42.Conclusions: Findings of this secondary data analysis reveal that a pain-assessing smart home may recognize pain-related behaviors. Utilizing clinicians' real-world knowledge when developing pain-assessing machine learning models improves the model's performance. A larger study focusing on pain-related behaviors is warranted to improve and test model performance.

TI  - Research on artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted anesthesia intelligent monitoring and diagnostic methods in health care
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the field of health care, anesthesia is a crucial therapeutic measure, but it also carries certain risks. Insufficient or excessive anesthesia can lead to significant consequences for patients, such as intraoperative awareness and impaired spontaneous breathing. Therefore, monitoring the depth of anesthesia is one of the vital life-supporting measures during clinical surgery. Currently, commonly used clinical indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate are used to estimate the depth of anesthesia in patients. However, due to variations in patients' physical conditions and anesthesia medications, these indicators exhibit significant differences in their performance such that there is not reliable that analyzing these clinical indicators alone. Therefore, considering that electroencephalogram (EEG) reflects a high degree of brain activity, this paper proposes an intelligent detection for anesthesia based on the transformer framework and EEG signals. First, the original single-channel EEG is preprocessed to extract spectral and differential entropy features. Subsequently, the two types of features are fused and sent to the transformer encoder network to complete the anesthesia depth prediction. Finally, the validation of the proposed algorithm was completed on the sevoflurane anesthesia dataset from Waikato Hospital in Hamilton, New Zealand, and a high prediction probability of 85.32% was achieved.

TI  - Machine learning techniques for computer-based decision systems in the operating theatre: application to analgesia delivery
T2  - LOGIC JOURNAL OF THE IGPL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to assist the clinicians in the administration of analgesic drug during general anaesthesia. Specifically, the main objective is to propose the basis of an intelligent system capable of making decisions to guide the opioid dose changes based on a new nociception monitor, the analgesia nociception index (ANI). Clinical data were obtained from 15 patients undergoing cholecystectomy surgery. By means of an off-line study, machine learning techniques were applied to analyse the possible relationship between the analgesic dose changes performed by the physician due to the hemodynamic activity of the patients and the evolution of the ANI. After training different classifiers and testing the results under cross validation, a preliminary relationship between the evolution of ANI and the dosage of remifentanil was found. These results evidence the potential of the ANI as a promising index to guide the infusion of analgesia.

TI  - Machine learning-based prediction of intraoperative hypoxemia for pediatric patients
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundReducing the duration of intraoperative hypoxemia in pediatric patients by means of rapid detection and early intervention is considered crucial by clinicians. We aimed to develop and validate a machine learning model that can predict intraoperative hypoxemia events 1 min ahead in children undergoing general anesthesia. MethodsThis retrospective study used prospectively collected intraoperative vital signs and parameters from the anesthesia ventilator machine extracted every 2 s in pediatric patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia between January 2019 and October 2020 in a tertiary academic hospital. Intraoperative hypoxemia was defined as oxygen saturation <95% at any point during surgery. Three common machine learning techniques were employed to develop models using the training dataset: gradient-boosting machine (GBM), long short-term memory (LSTM), and transformer. The performances of the models were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve using randomly assigned internal testing dataset. We also validated the developed models using temporal holdout dataset. Pediatric patient surgery cases between November 2020 and January 2021 were used. The performances of the models were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). ResultsIn total, 1,540 (11.73%) patients with intraoperative hypoxemia out of 13,130 patients' records with 2,367 episodes were included for developing the model dataset. After model development, 200 (13.25%) of the 1,510 patients' records with 289 episodes were used for holdout validation. Among the models developed, the GBM had the highest AUROC of 0.904 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.902 to 0.906), which was significantly higher than that of the LSTM (0.843, 95% CI 0.840 to 0.846 P < .001) and the transformer model (0.885, 95% CI, 0.882-0.887, P < .001). In holdout validation, GBM also demonstrated best performance with an AUROC of 0.939 (95% CI 0.936 to 0.941) which was better than LSTM (0.904, 95% CI 0.900 to 0.907, P < .001) and the transformer model (0.929, 95% CI 0.926 to 0.932, P < .001). ConclusionsMachine learning models can be used to predict upcoming intraoperative hypoxemia in real-time based on the biosignals acquired by patient monitors, which can be useful for clinicians for prediction and proactive treatment of hypoxemia in an intraoperative setting.

TI  - Automatic Classification of Sedation Levels in ICU Patients Using Heart Rate Variability
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the potential value of heart rate variability features for automated monitoring of sedation levels in mechanically ventilated ICU patients.Design: Multicenter, pilot study.Setting: Several ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.Patients: Electrocardiogram recordings from 40 mechanically ventilated adult patients receiving sedatives in an ICU setting were used to develop and test the proposed automated system.Measurements and Main Results: Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale scores were acquired prospectively to assess patient sedation levels and were used as ground truth. Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale scores were grouped into four levels, denoted "unarousable" (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale = -5, -4), "sedated" (-3, -2, -1), "awake" (0), "agitated" (+1, +2, +3, +4). A multiclass support vector machine algorithm was used for classification. Classifier training and performance evaluations were carried out using leave-oneout cross validation. An overall accuracy of 69% was achieved for discriminating between the four levels of sedation. The proposed system was able to reliably discriminate (accuracy = 79%) between sedated (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale < 0) and nonsedated states (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale > 0).Conclusions: With further refinement, the methodology reported herein could lead to a fully automated system for depth of sedation monitoring. By enabling monitoring to be continuous, such technology may help clinical staff to monitor sedation levels more effectively and to reduce complications related to over-and undersedation.

TI  - Leveraging artificial intelligence to identify high-risk patients for postoperative sore throat: An observational study
T2  - BIOMOLECULES AND BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Postoperative sore throat (POST) isa prevalent complication after general anesthesia and targeting high-risk patients helps in its prevention. This study developed and validated a machine learning model to predict POST. A total number of 834 patients who underwent general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were included in this study. Data from a cohort of 685 patients was used for model development and validation, while a cohort of 149 patients served for external validation. The prediction performance of random forest (RF), neural network (NN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models was compared using comprehensive performance metrics. The Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) methods elucidated the best-performing model. POST incidences across training, validation, and testing cohorts were 41.7%, 38.4%, and 36.2%, respectively. Five predictors were age, sex, endotracheal tube cuff pressure, endotracheal tube insertion depth, and the time interval between extubation and the first drinking of water after extubation. After incorporating these variables, the NN model demonstrated superior generalization capabilities in predicting POST when compared to the XGBoost and RF models in external validation, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.81(95% CI 0.74-0.89) and a precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.77 (95% CI 0.66-0.86). The model also showed good calibration and clinical usage values. The NN model outperforms the XGBoost and RF models in predicting POST, with potential applications in the healthcare industry for reducing the incidence of this common postoperative complication.

TI  - Multi-level Pain Quantification using a Smartphone and Electrodermal Activity.
T2  - Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Appropriate prescription of pain medication is challenging because pain is difficult to quantify due to the subjectiveness of pain assessment. Currently, clinicians must entirely rely on pain scales based on patients' assessments. This has been alleged to be one of the causes of drug overdose and addiction, and a contributor to the opioid crisis. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for objective pain assessment. Furthermore, as pain can occur anytime and anywhere, ambulatory pain monitoring would be welcomed in practice. In our previous study, we developed electrodermal activity (EDA)-derived indices and implemented them in a smartphone application that can communicate via Bluetooth to an EDA wearable device. While we previously showed high accuracy for high-level pain detection, multi-level pain detection has not been demonstrated. In this paper, we tested our smartphone application with a multi-level pain-induced dataset. The dataset was collected from fifteen subjects who underwent four levels of pain-inducing electrical pulse (EP) stimuli. We then performed statistical analyses and machine-learning techniques to classify multiple pain levels. Significant differences were observed in our EDA-derived indices among no-pain, low-pain, and high-pain segments. A random forest classifier showed 62.6% for the balanced accuracy, and a random forest regressor exhibited 0.441 for the coefficient of determination. Clinical Relevance - This is one of the first studies to present a smartphone application for detecting multiple levels of pain in real time using an EDA wearable device. This work shows the feasibility of ambulatory pain monitoring which can potentially be useful for chronic pain management.

TI  - Improving representation of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic study participants in a trial of virtual reality for chronic lower back pain
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARYAlthough digital health technologies are now widely available for both therapeutic and monitoringapplications, there are racial and ethnic disparities in uptake and effectiveness of digital healthinterventions. Of relevance to our parent HEAL study examining a digital health intervention (virtualreality) for pain management, recent data indicate that non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patientsare less likely to have access to digital health information and more likely to report severe pain thannon-Hispanic whites. In addition to disparities in access and adoption of digital health interventions,there are known disparities in the incidence and reporting of pain by racial and ethnic minorities.For example, study of 2000 patients found that non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients weremore likely to report severe pain than non-Hispanic whites. The proposed study for this Diversity,Inclusion and Engagement Supplement to our NIH HEAL study evaluating the role of therapeuticVR for chronic lower back pain (cLBP) will provide a framework to advance diversity and inclusionefforts for future digital health trials at our medical center and beyond. Further, it will enhance theparent study by seeking to increase the proportion of participants with historically less access toand familiarity with digital technologies while enhancing overall participant racial and ethnicdiversity. Using the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development supported byadvances in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven cohort building tools, we propose to meaningfullyimprove enrollment rates of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants in our parent NIH HEALstudy by achieving two aims: (1) tailor recruitment materials for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanicpatients with cLBP in partnership with representative patient advisory boards; and (2) oversamplenon-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants in parent study using an AI-driven cohort buildingtool housed within the electronic health record.

TI  - Investigation of Middle Ear Pressure Changes During Prone Position Under General Anesthesia Without Using Nitrous Oxide
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The effects of different body positions on the middle ear were reported in several studies, but there are no data about the effects on patients under general anesthesia. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of prone position on middle ear pressure (MEP) during general anesthesia without using nitrous oxide.Methods: Twenty patients under general anesthesia during prone position were included in the study. The performed anesthesia method was the same for all patients. Remifentanil was used for analgesia instead of nitrous oxide. MEPs were measured 5 times with a middle ear analyzer: before induction (BI), after intubation (AI), after turned to the prone position (PP1), at the end of the prone position (PP2), and after returned to the supine position (SP). Duration of prone position was also recorded.Results: Of the 20 patients were 11 women and 9 men with a 49 +/- 13 mean age. BI-AI, AI-PP1, PP1-PP2, and PP2-SP comparisons of both MEPs were statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Right mean MEPs were BI, -1 +/- 23 daPa; AI, 41 +/- 51 daPa; PP1, 124 +/- 76 daPa; PP2, 152 +/- 59 daPa; and SP, 63 +/- 29 daPa; whereas left mean MEPs were BI, -24 +/- 55 daPa; AI, 28 +/- 34 daPa; PP1, 132 +/- 67 daPa; PP2, 162 +/- 48 daPa; and SP, 70 +/- 89 daPa. Significant increases were detected at the start and continuation of the prone position. The mean duration of prone position was 98 +/- 51 per minute.Conclusions: The significant MEP increases during the prone position under general anesthesia depend on a number of reasons. Among them are inhaler agents, pressure changes in mucosal blood vessels due to venous congestion, and the mastoid bone volume. Further researches are required to determine and explain the mechanisms of increase in MEP during prone position.

TI  - StruNet: Perceptual and low-rank regularized transformer for medical image denoising
T2  - MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundVarious types of noise artifacts inevitably exist in some medical imaging modalities due to limitations of imaging techniques, which impair either clinical diagnosis or subsequent analysis. Recently, deep learning approaches have been rapidly developed and applied on medical images for noise removal or image quality enhancement. Nevertheless, due to complexity and diversity of noise distribution representations in different medical imaging modalities, most of the existing deep learning frameworks are incapable to flexibly remove noise artifacts while retaining detailed information. As a result, it remains challenging to design an effective and unified medical image denoising method that will work across a variety of noise artifacts for different imaging modalities without requiring specialized knowledge in performing the task. PurposeIn this paper, we propose a novel encoder-decoder architecture called Swin transformer-based residual u-shape Network (StruNet), for medical image denoising. MethodsOur StruNet adopts a well-designed block as the backbone of the encoder-decoder architecture, which integrates Swin Transformer modules with residual block in parallel connection. Swin Transformer modules could effectively learn hierarchical representations of noise artifacts via self-attention mechanism in non-overlapping shifted windows and cross-window connection, while residual block is advantageous to compensate loss of detailed information via shortcut connection. Furthermore, perceptual loss and low-rank regularization are incorporated into loss function respectively in order to constrain the denoising results on feature-level consistency and low-rank characteristics. ResultsTo evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we have conducted experiments on three medical imaging modalities including computed tomography (CT), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). ConclusionsThe results demonstrate that the proposed architecture yields a promising performance of suppressing multiform noise artifacts existing in different imaging modalities.

TI  - Periprocedure Management of Blood Pressure After Acute Ischemic Stroke
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The management of acute ischemic stroke primarily revolves around the timely restoration of blood flow (recanalization/reperfusion) in the occluded vessel and maintenance of cerebral perfusion through collaterals before reperfusion. Mechanical thrombectomy is the most effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusions in appropriately selected patients. Judicious management of blood pressure before, during, and after mechanical thrombectomy is critical to ensure good outcomes by preventing progression of cerebral ischemia as well hemorrhagic conversion, in addition to optimizing systemic perfusion. While direct evidence to support specific hemodynamic targets around mechanical thrombectomy is limited, there is increasing interest in this area. Newer approaches to blood pressure management utilizing individualized cerebral autoregulation-based targets are being explored. Early efforts at utilizing machine learning to predict blood pressure treatment thresholds and therapies also seem promising; this focused review aims to provide an update on recent evidence around periprocedural blood pressure management after acute ischemic stroke, highlighting its implications for clinical practice while identifying gaps in current literature.

T2  - SIMULATED EVOLUTION AND LEARNING (SEAL 2014)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Conference on Simulated Evolution and Learning (SEAL)
CL  - Dunedin, NEW ZEALAND
AB  - In this paper, we propose a feature extraction and machine learning method for the classification of ultrasound images obtained from lumbar spine of pregnant patients in the transverse plane. A set of features, including matching values and positions, appearance of black pixels within predefined windows along the midline, are extracted from the ultrasound images using template matching and midline detection. Artificial neural network is utilized to classify the bone images and interspinous images. The neural network is trained with 1000 images from 25 pregnant subjects and tested on 720 images from a separate set of 18 pregnant patients. A high success rate (96.95% on training set, 95.75% on validation set and 94.12% on test set) is achieved with the proposed method. The trained neural network further tested on 43 videos collected from 43 pregnant subjects and successfully identified the proper needle insertion site (interspinous region) in all of the cases. Therefore, the proposed method is able to identify the ultrasound images of lumbar spine in an automatic manner, so as to facilitate the anesthetists' work to identify the needle insertion point precisely and effectively.

T2  - PEC innovation
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: Patient-physician communication affects cancer patients' satisfaction, health outcomes, and reimbursement for physician services. Our objective is to use machine learning to comprehensively examine the association between patient satisfaction and physician factors in clinical consultations about cancer prognosis and pain.Methods: We used data from audio-recorded, transcribed communications between physicians and standardized patients (SPs). We analyzed the data using logistic regression (LR) and random forests (RF).Results: The LR models suggested that lower patient satisfaction was associated with more in-depth prognosis discussion; and higher patient satisfaction was associated with a greater extent of shared decision making, patient being black, and doctor being young. Conversely, the RF models suggested the opposite association with the same set of variables.Conclusion: Somewhat contradicting results from distinct machine learning models suggested possible confounding factors (hidden variables) in prognosis discussion, shared decision-making, and doctor age, on the modeling of patient satisfaction. Practitioners should not make inferences with one single data-modeling method and enlarge the study cohort to help deal with population heterogeneity.Innovation: Comparing diverse machine learning models (both parametric and non-parametric types) and carefully applying variable selection methods prior to regression modeling, can enrich the examination of physician factors in characterizing patient-physician communication outcomes.

TI  - Real-time machine learning classification of pallidal borders during deep brain stimulation surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) in patients with Parkinson's disease and dystonia improves motor symptoms and quality of life. Traditionally, pallidal borders have been demarcated by electrophysiological microelectrode recordings (MERs) during DBS surgery. However, detection of pallidal borders can be challenging due to the variability of the firing characteristics of neurons encountered along the trajectory. MER can also be time-consuming and therefore costly. Here we show the feasibility of real-time machine learning classification of striato-pallidal borders to assist neurosurgeons during DBS surgery. Approach. An electrophysiological dataset from 116 trajectories of 42 patients consisting of 11 774 MER segments of background spiking activity in five classes of disease was used to train the classification algorithm. The five classes included awake Parkinson's disease patients, as well as awake and lightly anesthetized genetic and non-genetic dystonia patients. A machine learning algorithm was designed to provide prediction of the striato-pallidal borders, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) and the L-1-distance measure in normalized root mean square (NRMS) and power spectra of the MER. We tested its performance prospectively against the judgment of three electrophysiologists in the operating rooms of three hospitals using newly collected data. Main results. The awake and the light anesthesia dystonia classes could be merged. Using MER NRMS and spectra, the machine learning algorithm was on par with the performance of the three electrophysiologists across the striatum-GPe, GPe-GPi, and GPi-exit transitions for all disease classes. Significance. Machine learning algorithms enable real-time GPi navigation systems to potentially shorten the duration of electrophysiological mapping of pallidal borders, while ensuring correct pallidal border detection.

TI  - Enabling personalized perioperative risk prediction by using a machine-learning model based on preoperative data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Preoperative risk assessment is essential for shared decision-making and adequate perioperative care. Common scores provide limited predictive quality and lack personalized information. The aim of this study was to create an interpretable machine-learning-based model to assess the patient's individual risk of postoperative mortality based on preoperative data to allow analysis of personal risk factors. After ethical approval, a model for prediction of postoperative in-hospital mortality based on preoperative data of 66,846 patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery between June 2014 and March 2020 was created with extreme gradient boosting. Model performance and the most relevant parameters were shown using receiver operating characteristic (ROC-) and precision-recall (PR-) curves and importance plots. Individual risks of index patients were presented in waterfall diagrams. The model included 201 features and showed good predictive abilities with an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.95 and an area under precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.109. The feature with the highest information gain was the preoperative order for red packed cell concentrates followed by age and c-reactive protein. Individual risk factors could be identified on patient level. We created a highly accurate and interpretable machine learning model to preoperatively predict the risk of postoperative in-hospital mortality. The algorithm can be used to identify factors susceptible to preoperative optimization measures and to identify risk factors influencing individual patient risk.

TI  - Reduced postoperative pain in patients receiving nociception monitor guided analgesia during elective major abdominal surgery: a randomized, controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nociception Level index (NOL (TM)) is a multiparameter index, based on artificial intelligence for the monitoring of nociception during anesthesia. We studied the influence of NOL-guided analgesia on postoperative pain scores in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery during sevoflurane/fentanyl anesthesia. This study was designed as a single-center, prospective randomized, controlled study. After Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent, 75 ASA 1-3 adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, were randomized to NOL-guided fentanyl dosing (NOL) or standard care (SOC) and completed the study. The sevoflurane target MAC range was 0.8-1.2. In the NOL-guided group (N = 36), when NOL values were > 25 for at least 1 min, a weight adjusted fentanyl bolus was administered. In the control group (N = 39) fentanyl administration was based on hemodynamic indices and clinician judgement. After surgery, pain, was evaluated using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scale, ranging from 0 to 10, at 15 min intervals for 180 min or until patient discharge from the PACU. Median postoperative pain scores reported were 3.0 [interquartile range 0.0-5.0] and 5.0 [3.0-6.0] at 90 min in NOL-guided and control groups respectively (Bootstrap corrected actual difference 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.4-2.6). There was no difference in postoperative morphine consumption or intraoperative fentanyl consumption. Postoperative pain scores were significantly improved in nociception level index-guided patients. We attribute this to more objective fentanyl dosing when timed to actual nociceptive stimuli during anesthesia, contributing to lower levels of sympathetic activation and surgical stress.

A1  - Dutch ColoRectal Audit
TI  - Predictors of 30-Day Mortality Among Dutch Patients Undergoing Colorectal Cancer Surgery, 2011-2016
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Question Can big-data analysis of clinical audits help to find new risk factors and predict adverse events associated with colorectal cancer surgery? Findings This cohort study found that machine learning applied to a clinical audit containing 62 501 records and 103 preoperative variables of surgically treated patients with colorectal cancer outperformed conventional scores in predicting 30-day postoperative mortality but with similar performance as a preexisting case-mix model. New risk factors for several other adverse events may be identified. Meaning This study suggests that machine learning methods may be of additional value in analyzing quality indicators in colorectal cancer surgery, thereby providing directions to optimize case-mix corrections for benchmarking in clinical auditing.Importance Quality improvement programs for colorectal cancer surgery have been introduced with benchmarking based on quality indicators, such as mortality. Detailed (pre)operative characteristics may offer relevant information for proper case-mix correction. Objective To investigate the added value of machine learning to predict quality indicators for colorectal cancer surgery and identify previously unrecognized predictors of 30-day mortality based on a large, nationwide colorectal cancer registry that collected extensive data on comorbidities. Design, Setting, and Participants All patients who underwent resection for primary colorectal cancer registered in the Dutch ColoRectal Audit between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016, were included. Multiple machine learning models (multivariable logistic regression, elastic net regression, support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting) were made to predict quality indicators. Model performance was compared with conventionally used scores. Risk factors were identified by logistic regression analyses and Shapley additive explanations (ie, SHAP values). Statistical analysis was performed between March 1 and September 30, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome of this cohort study was 30-day mortality. Prediction models were trained on a training set by performing 5-fold cross-validation, and outcomes were measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve on the test set. Machine learning was further used to identify risk factors, measured by odds ratios and SHAP values. Results This cohort study included 62 501 records, most patients were male (35 116 [56.2%]), were aged 61 to 80 years (41 560 [66.5%]), and had an American Society of Anesthesiology score of II (35 679 [57.1%]). A 30-day mortality rate of 2.7% (n = 1693) was found. The area under the curve of the best machine learning model for 30-day mortality (0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.85) was significantly higher than the American Society of Anesthesiology score (0.74; 95% CI, 0.71-0.77; P < .001), Charlson Comorbidity Index (0.66; 95% CI, 0.63-0.70; P < .001), and preoperative score to predict postoperative mortality (0.73; 95% CI, 0.70-0.77; P < .001). Hypertension, myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma were comorbidities with a high risk for increased mortality. Machine learning identified specific risk factors for a complicated course, intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospital stay, and readmission. Laparoscopic surgery was associated with a decreased risk for all adverse outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance This study found that machine learning methods outperformed conventional scores to predict 30-day mortality after colorectal cancer surgery, identified specific patient groups at risk for adverse outcomes, and provided directions to optimize benchmarking in clinical audits.This cohort study investigates the ability of machine learning to predict quality indicators for colorectal cancer surgery and identify previously unrecognized predictors of 30-day mortality based on a large nationwide colorectal cancer registry that collected extensive data on comorbidities.

TI  - Imbalanced regression for intensity series of pain expression from videos by regularizing spatio-temporal face nets
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining accurate patient-reported pain intensity is essential for effective pain management. An auto-matic pain recognition system can simplify the pain reporting process and reduce the strain on manual effort s. Limited and imbalanced labeled data are available for the research of estimating the intensity of pain based on facial expressions. However, the ability to train deep networks for automated pain assess-ment is limited by small datasets with imbalanced labels of patient-reported pain levels. Fortunately, fine-tuning from a data-extensive pre-trained domain, such as face verification or recognition, can alleviate this problem to some extent. In this paper, we propose a network which fine-tunes a face verification or recognition network using a regularized regression loss and additional data with pain-intensity labels. The expression intensity regression task can benefit from the rich feature representations trained on a large number of data for face analysis tasks. In order to explore the temporal information between frames, we combine CNN with LSTM to obtain a better prediction result of each frame in videos. A weighted evalua-tion metric and re-sampling technique are also proposed to address the imbalance issue of different pain levels. The proposed regularized deep regressor is applied to estimate the pain expression intensity and verified on the widely-used UNBC-McMaster Shoulder-Pain dataset and BioVid Heat Pain dataset, achiev-ing the state-of-the-art performance. As pain detection is a form of micro facial expression recognition, we also apply the transferred deep regressor to estimate the intensity of facial action units, obtaining high quality performance.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Investigation of optical neuro-monitoring technique for detection of maintenance and emergence states during general anesthesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The American Society of Anesthesiologist recommends peripheral physiological monitoring during general anesthesia, which offers no information regarding the effects of anesthetics on the brain. Since no "gold standard" method exists for this evaluation, such a technique is needed to ensure patient comfort, procedure quality and safety. In this study we investigated functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as possible monitor of anesthetic effects on the prefrontal cortex. Anesthetic drugs, such as sevoflurane, suppress the cerebral metabolism and alter the cerebral blood flow. We hypothesize that fNIRS derived features carry information on the effects of anesthetics on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that can be used for the classification of the anesthetized state. In this study, patients were continuously monitored using fNIRS, BIS and standard monitoring during surgical procedures under sevoflurane general anesthesia. Maintenance and emergence states were identified and fNIRS features were identified and compared between states. Linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms were investigated as methods for the classification of maintenance/emergence. The results show that changes in oxygenated (HbO(2)) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) concentration and blood volume measured by fNIRS were associated with the transition between maintenance and emergence that occurs as a result of sevoflurane washout. We observed that during maintenance the signal is relatively more stable than during emergence. Maintenance and emergence states were classified with 94.7% accuracy with a non-linear model using the locally derived mean total hemoglobin, standard deviation of HbO(2), minimum and range of HbO(2) and HHb as features. These features were found to be correlated with the effects of sevoflurane and to carry information that allows real time and automatic classification of the anesthetized state with high accuracy.

TI  - Machine learning approaches in predicting ambulatory same day discharge patients after total hip arthroplasty
T2  - REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background With continuing financial and regulatory pressures, practice of ambulatory total hip arthroplasty is increasing. However, studies focusing on selection of optimal candidates are burdened by limitations related to traditional statistical approaches. Hereby we aimed to apply machine learning algorithm to identify characteristics associated with optimal candidates.Methods This retrospective cohort study included elective total hip arthroplasty (n=63 859) recorded in National Surgical Quality Improvement Program dataset from 2017 to 2018. The main outcome was length of stay. A total of 40 candidate variables were considered. We applied machine learning algorithms (multivariable logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest models) to predict length of stay=0 day. Models' accuracies and area under the curve were calculated.Results Applying machine learning models to compare length of stay=0 day to length of stay=1-3 days cases, we found area under the curve of 0.715, 0.762, and 0.804, accuracy of 0.65, 0.73, and 0.81 for logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest model, respectively. Regarding the most important predictive features, anesthesia type, body mass index, age, ethnicity, white blood cell count, sodium level, and alkaline phosphatase were highlighted in machine learning models.Conclusions Machine learning algorithm exhibited acceptable model quality and accuracy. Machine learning algorithms highlighted the as yet unrecognized impact of laboratory testing on future patient ambulatory pathway assignment.

T2  - EUROPEAN GERIATRIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic radical resection of colorectal cancer from July 2019 to May 2021 were selected. The patients were assigned to Ai-PCIA group and control group. Ai-PCIA group received postoperative analgesia management and effect evaluation through intelligent wireless analgesia system + postoperative follow-up twice a day, while control group received analgesia management and effect evaluation through ward physician feedback + postoperative follow-up twice a day. The pain numerical score (NRS), Richards-Campbell Sleep Scale (RCSQ), and adverse outcomes were collected and compared.Results A total of 60 patients (20 females and 40 males with average (78.26 +/- 6.42) years old) were included. The NRS scores at rest and during activity of the Ai-PCA group at 8, 12, and 24 h after the operation were significantly lower than that of the control group (all P < 0.05). The RCSQ score of Ai-PCA group was significantly higher than that of control group on the 1st and 2nd days after operation (all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the incidence of dizziness and nausea, vomiting, and myocardial ischemia (all P > 0.05).Conclusions Ai-PCIA can improve the analgesic effect and sleep quality of older patients after laparoscopic radical resection, which may be promoted in clinical analgesia practice.

TI  - Prediction of opioid dose in cancer pain patients using genetic profiling: not yet an option with support vector machine learning.
T2  - BMC research notes
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Use of opioids for pain management has increased over the past decade; however, inadequate analgesic response is common. Genetic variability may be related to opioid efficacy, but due to the many possible combinations and variables, statistical computations may be difficult. This study investigated whether data processing with support vector machine learning could predict required opioid dose in cancer pain patients, using genetic profiling. Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the  and delta opioid receptor genes and the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene were selected for analysis.RESULTS: Data from 1237 cancer pain patients were included in the analysis. Support vector machine learning did not find any associations between the assessed SNPs and opioid dose in cancer pain patients, and hence, did not provide additional information regarding prediction of required opioid dose using genetic profiling.

TI  - Random Fourier Features-Based Deep Learning Improvement with Class Activation Interpretability for Nerve Structure Segmentation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Peripheral nerve blocking (PNB) is a standard procedure to support regional anesthesia. Still, correct localization of the nerve's structure is needed to avoid adverse effects; thereby, ultrasound images are used as an aid approach. In addition, image-based automatic nerve segmentation from deep learning methods has been proposed to mitigate attenuation and speckle noise ultrasonography issues. Notwithstanding, complex architectures highlight the region of interest lacking suitable data interpretability concerning the learned features from raw instances. Here, a kernel-based deep learning enhancement is introduced for nerve structure segmentation. In a nutshell, a random Fourier features-based approach was utilized to complement three well-known semantic segmentation architectures, e.g., fully convolutional network, U-net, and ResUnet. Moreover, two ultrasound image datasets for PNB were tested. Obtained results show that our kernel-based approach provides a better generalization capability from image segmentation-based assessments on different nerve structures. Further, for data interpretability, a semantic segmentation extension of the GradCam++ for class-activation mapping was used to reveal relevant learned features separating between nerve and background. Thus, our proposal favors both straightforward (shallow) and complex architectures (deeper neural networks).

TI  - Tonic down-rolling and eccentric down-positioning of eyes under sevoflurane anesthesia without non-depolarizing muscle relaxant and its relationship with depth of anesthesia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo analyze the relationship between eccentric downward eye movement/eccentric downward eye-positioning (EDEM/EDEP) encountered in patients undergoing ophthalmic surgeries and its return to a centralized position under general anesthesia (GA) with the depth of anesthesia (DOA). MethodsPatients undergoing ophthalmic surgeries (6 months-12 years) under sevoflurane anesthesia without non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (NDMR) who witnessed a sudden tonic EDEM/EDEP were both retrospectively (R-group) and prospectively (P-group) enrolled (ambispective study). R-group included data-points after induction (AI) till the time surgery lasted while P-group compiled data both during induction (DI) and AI. DOA in terms of MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) at the time of EDEM/EDEP and centralization of eyeball and their timings were noted and compared for both AI and DI data-points. Also, vertical eccentric eye positions were scored and correlated with MAC. ResultsAI data included 22 (14R+8P) events and their mean MAC of EDEM/EDEP and centralization were 1.60 & PLUSMN; 0.25 and 1.18 & PLUSMN; 0.17 respectively (p = 0.000). DI data included 62 (P) cases and its mean MAC of EDEM/EDEP and centralization was 2.19 & PLUSMN; 0.43 and 1.39 & PLUSMN; 0.26 respectively (p = 0.000). Median (IQR) eye positions during down-positioning in 84 events was -3 (-3.9 to -2.5). It was preceded by an eccentric upward drift of eyes in 10/22 (6R+4P) AI cases. A strong negative correlation was seen between DOA and eccentric eye positions (r = -0.77, p = 0.000). ConclusionsTonic down-rolling of eyes is not uncommon in children seen without NDMR with higher depths of sevoflurane anesthesia compared to point of centralization and fluctuations in DOA should be avoided to circumvent inadvertent complications during ocular surgery.

TI  - Deep Learning Model for Automated Trainee Assessment During High-Fidelity Simulation
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ProblemImplementation of competency-based medical education has necessitated more frequent trainee assessments. Use of simulation as an assessment tool is limited by access to trained examiners, cost, and concerns with interrater reliability. Developing an automated tool for pass/fail assessment of trainees in simulation could improve accessibility and quality assurance of assessments. This study aimed to develop an automated assessment model using deep learning techniques to assess performance of anesthesiology trainees in a simulated critical event.ApproachThe authors retrospectively analyzed anaphylaxis simulation videos to train and validate a deep learning model. They used an anaphylactic shock simulation video database from an established simulation curriculum, integrating a convenience sample of 52 usable videos. The core part of the model, developed between July 2019 and July 2020, is a bidirectional transformer encoder.OutcomesThe main outcome was the F1 score, accuracy, recall, and precision of the automated assessment model in analyzing pass/fail of trainees in simulation videos. Five models were developed and evaluated. The strongest model was model 1 with an accuracy of 71% and an F1 score of 0.68.Next StepsThe authors demonstrated the feasibility of developing a deep learning model from a simulation database that can be used for automated assessment of medical trainees in a simulated anaphylaxis scenario. The important next steps are to (1) integrate a larger simulation dataset to improve the accuracy of the model; (2) assess the accuracy of the model on alternative anaphylaxis simulations, additional medical disciplines, and alternative medical education evaluation modalities; and (3) gather feedback from education leadership and clinician educators surrounding the perceived strengths and weaknesses of deep learning models for simulation assessment. Overall, this novel approach for performance prediction has broad implications in medical education and assessment.

TI  - Predicting intraoperative hypotension using deep learning with waveforms of arterial blood pressure, electroencephalogram, and electrocardiogram: Retrospective study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - To develop deep learning models for predicting Interoperative hypotension (IOH) using waveforms from arterial blood pressure (ABP), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalogram (EEG), and to determine whether combination ABP with EEG or CG improves model performance. Data were retrieved from VitalDB, a public data repository of vital signs taken during surgeries in 10 operating rooms at Seoul National University Hospital from January 6, 2005, to March 1, 2014. Retrospective data from 14,140 adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery with general anaesthesia were used. The predictive performances of models trained with different combinations of waveforms were evaluated and compared at time points at 3, 5, 10, 15 minutes before the event. The performance was calculated by area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), sensitivity and specificity. The model performance was better in the model using both ABP and EEG waveforms than in all other models at all time points (3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes before an event) Using high-fidelity ABP and EEG waveforms, the model predicted IOH with a AUROC and AUPRC of 0.935 [0.932 to 0.938] and 0.882 [0.876 to 0.887] at 5 minutes before an IOH event. The output of both ABP and EEG was more calibrated than that using other combinations or ABP alone. The results demonstrate that a predictive deep neural network can be trained using ABP, ECG, and EEG waveforms, and the combination of ABP and EEG improves model performance and calibration.

TI  - Using sensor-fusion and machine-learning algorithms to assess acute pain in non-verbal infants: a study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Objective pain assessment in non-verbal populations is clinically challenging due to their inability to express their pain via self-report. Repetitive exposures to acute or prolonged pain lead to clinical instability, with long-term behavioural and cognitive sequelae in newborn infants. Strong analgesics are also associated with medical complications, potential neurotoxicity and altered brain development. Pain scores performed by bedside nurses provide subjective, observer-dependent assessments rather than objective data for infant pain management; the required observations are labour intensive, difficult to perform by a nurse who is concurrently performing the procedure and increase the nursing workload. Multimodal pain assessment, using sensor-fusion and machine-learning algorithms, can provide a patient-centred, context-dependent, observer-independent and objective pain measure. Methods and analysis In newborns undergoing painful procedures, we use facial electromyography to record facial muscle activity-related infant pain, ECG to examine heart rate (HR) changes and HR variability, electrodermal activity (skin conductance) to measure catecholamine-induced palmar sweating, changes in oxygen saturations and skin perfusion, and electroencephalography using active electrodes to assess brain activity in real time. This multimodal approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of pain assessment in non-verbal infants and may even allow continuous pain monitoring at the bedside. The feasibility of this approach will be evaluated in an observational prospective study of clinically required painful procedures in 60 preterm and term newborns, and infants aged 6 months or less. Ethics and dissemination The Institutional Review Board of the Stanford University approved the protocol. Study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, taught via webinars, podcasts and video tutorials, and listed on academic/scientific websites. Future studies will validate and refine this approach using the minimum number of sensors required to assess neonatal/infant pain.

TI  - Thermodynamic Interpretation of a Machine-Learning-Based Response Surface Model and Its Application to Pharmacodynamic Synergy between Propofol and Opioids
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Propofol and fentanyl are commonly used agents for the induction of anesthesia, and are often associated with hemodynamic disturbances. Understanding pharmacodynamic impacts is vital for parasympathetic and sympathetic tones during the anesthesia induction period. Inspired by the thermodynamic interaction between drug concentrations and effects, we established a machine-learning-based response surface model (MLRSM) to address this predicament. Then, we investigated and modeled the biomedical phenomena in the autonomic nervous system. Our study prospectively enrolled 60 patients, and the participants were assigned to two groups randomly and equally. Group 1 received propofol first, followed by fentanyl, and the drug sequence followed an inverse procedure in Group 2. Then, we extracted and analyzed the spectrograms of electrocardiography (ECG) and pulse photoplethysmography (PPG) signals after induction of propofol and fentanyl. Eventually, we utilized the proposed MLRSM to evaluate the relationship between anesthetics and the integrity/balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity by employing the power of high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) bands and PPG amplitude (PPGA). It is worth emphasizing that the proposed MLRSM exhibits a similar mathematical form to the conventional Greco model, but with better computational performance. Furthermore, the MLRSM has a theoretical foundation and flexibility for arbitrary numbers of drug combinations. The modeling results are consistent with the previous literature. We employed the bootstrap algorithm to inspect the results' consistency and measure the various statistical fluctuations. Then, the comparison between the modeling and the bootstrapping results was used to validate the statistical stability and the feasibility of the proposed MLRSM.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Shenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Estimating the remaining surgery duration (RSD) during surgical procedures can be useful for OR planning and anesthesia dose estimation. With the recent success of deep learning-based methods in computer vision, several neural network approaches have been proposed for fully automatic RSD prediction based solely on visual data from the endoscopic camera. We investigate whether RSD prediction can be improved using unsupervised temporal video segmentation as an auxiliary learning task. As opposed to previous work, which presented supervised surgical phase recognition as auxiliary task, we avoid the need for manual annotations by proposing a similar but unsupervised learning objective which clusters video sequences into temporally coherent segments. In multiple experimental setups, results obtained by learning the auxiliary task are incorporated into a deep RSD model through feature extraction, pretraining or regularization. Further, we propose a novel loss function for RSD training which attempts to counteract unfavorable characteristics of the RSD ground truth. Using our unsupervised method as an auxiliary task for RSD training, we outperform other self-supervised methods and are comparable to the supervised state-of-the-art. Combined with the novel RSD loss, we slightly outperform the supervised approach.

TI  - Machine learning for fast motion compensated quantitative abdominal DCE-MRI
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project Summary:Functional imaging with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) provides important physiological markersof permeability, perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function, without exposingpatients to ionizing radiation. DCE-MR images are at the same time used for evaluation of anatomy. Functionalmarkers from DCE-MRI, if computed accurately, would play a critical role in diagnosing and assessing theprogression of a number of pediatric diseases including those compromising kidney function, liver diseases,tumors, and Crohn's disease. One of the most important applications of DCE-MRI is assessing kidney function(GFR) in hydronephrosis patients with obstruction. In the absence of GFR information, children who stand tobenefit from immediate surgical reconstruction might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment, andthose who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., “watchful waiting”) might receive anunnecessary surgical intervention. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yieldssome useful diagnostic information, it is slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, anddelivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. There is a clinical need for accurate computation of quantitativefunctional markers. Unfortunately, current methods of DCE-MRI in neonates and children are less than optimal,and therefore, DCE-MRI is underutilized in clinical practice. The technical challenges include insufficienttemporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function (AIF) dynamics (which are required for accuratecomputation of quantitative markers), unavoidable respiratory motion and bulk motion (which reduce imagequality and significantly lower the accuracy of parameter estimates), and a lack of robust, fast, automated postprocessing techniques for accurate computation of markers. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop amotion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI method addressing these challenges. Theprimary objective of this exploratory, three-year study, is three-fold: first, to develop and evaluate a new bulkand respiratory motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI technique for accurateestimation of functional markers; second, to further improve the robustness and speed of DCE-MRI using afast, deep learning (DL) technique with integrated temporal prior for the reconstruction of motion-compensated,higher quality, high temporal resolution images; and third, to develop an automatic quantitative analysispipeline including segmentation and tracer kinetic model-fitting using DL techniques for fast, robust andaccurate quantification of functional markers. The successful completion of these aims will provide new,clinically important abdominal imaging capabilities, with real-time, motion-compensated image reconstructionand reliable real-time parameter estimation from high temporal and spatial resolution DCE-MRI. This work willextend the usefulness of DCE-MRI to pediatric patients who are unable to remain still in the scanner, andeliminate the need for repeated scans and sedation in infants. !!

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The biologic basis for intelligence rests to a large degree on the capacity for efficient integration of information across the cerebral network. We aimed to measure the relationship between network architecture and intelligence in the pediatric, epileptic brain.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were retrospectively identified with the following: 1) focal epilepsy; 2) brain MR imaging at 3T, including resting-state functional MR imaging; and 3) full-scale intelligence quotient measured by a pediatric neuropsychologist. The cerebral cortex was parcellated into approximately 700 gray matter network nodes. The strength of a connection between 2 nodes was defined by the correlation between their blood oxygen level-dependent time-series. We calculated the following topologic properties: clustering coefficient, transitivity, modularity, path length, and global efficiency. A machine learning algorithm was used to measure the independent contribution of each metric to the intelligence quotient after adjusting for all other metrics.RESULTS: Thirty patients met the criteria (4-18 years of age); 20 patients required anesthesia during MR imaging. After we accounted for age and sex, clustering coefficient and path length were independently associated with full-scale intelligence quotient. Neither motion parameters nor general anesthesia was an important variable with regard to accurate intelligence quotient prediction by the machine learning algorithm. A longer history of epilepsy was associated with shorter path lengths (P = .008), consistent with reorganization of the network on the basis of seizures. Considering only patients receiving anesthesia during machine learning did not alter the patterns of network architecture contributing to global intelligence.CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the physiologic relevance of imaging-based metrics of network architecture in the pathologic, developing brain.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Postoperative orthostatic intolerance (OI) can be a major obstacle to early ambulation and its determinants are poorly understood. We aimed to study postoperative changes in vascular tone and their potential association with OI in various orthopedic surgical settings.Methods In this prospective cohort study, 350 patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty under neuraxial anesthesia or spine surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. We determined the augmentation index (AI) as a measure of vascular tone and studied symptoms of OI using a validated questionnaire at various postoperative time points.Results The AI was significantly reduced postoperatively (at spinal resolution in patients with neuraxial anesthesia or two hours postoperatively in general anesthesia) compared with baseline values in all procedures and did not subsequently return to baseline throughout the postoperative period in the majority of patients [252/335 (75.2%); P < 0.001]. The majority [260/342 (76.0%); P < 0.001] of patients had postoperative symptoms of OI Nevertheless, no association was found between postoperative change in AI from baseline and postoperative symptoms of OI.Conclusions A significantly prolonged decrease in AI and symptoms of OI are common after orthopedic surgery. Nevertheless, an association between the two measures was not observed. While compensatory mechanisms may limit the influence of an AI decrease on symptoms of OI more research is needed to understand the contributing factors and aid in the identification of patients at risk of OI.

TI  - Using Machine Learning (ML) Models to Predict Risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Following Spine Surgery
T2  - CLINICAL SPINE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Design: A retrospective cohort study.Objectives: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially high-risk complication for patients undergoing spine surgery. Although guidelines for assessing VTE risk in this population have been established, development of new techniques that target different aspects of the medical history may prove to be of further utility. The goal of this study was to develop a predictive machine learning (ML) model to identify nontraditional risk factors for predicting VTE in spine surgery patients.Summary of Background Data: A cohort of 63 patients was identified who had undergone spine surgery at a single center from 2015 to 2021. Thirty-one patients had a confirmed VTE, while 32 had no VTE. A total of 113 attributes were defined and collected via chart review. Attribute categories included demographics, medications, labs, past medical history, operative history, and VTE diagnosis.Methods: The Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software was used in creating and evaluating the ML models. Six classifier models were tested with 10-fold cross-validation and statistically evaluated using t tests.Results: Comparing the predictive ML models to the control model (ZeroR), all predictive models were significantly better than the control model at predicting VTE risk, based on the 113 attributes (P<0.001). The Random Forest model had the highest accuracy of 88.89% with a positive predictive value of 93.75%. The Simple Logistic algorithm had an accuracy of 84.13% and defined risk attributes to include calcium and phosphate laboratory values, history of cardiac comorbidity, history of previous VTE, anesthesia time, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use, antibiotic use, and antihistamine use. The J48 model had an accuracy of 80.95% and it defined hemoglobin laboratory values, anesthesia time, beta-blocker use, dopamine agonist use, history of cancer, and Medicare use as potential VTE risk factors.Conclusion: Further development of these tools may provide high diagnostic value and may guide chemoprophylaxis treatment in this setting of high-risk patients.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to explore the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features based on deep learning super-resolution algorithms in evaluating the value of propofol anesthesia for brain protection of patients undergoing craniotomy evacuation of the hematoma. An optimized super-resolution algorithm was obtained through the multiscale network reconstruction model based on the traditional algorithm. A total of 100 patients undergoing craniotomy evacuation of hematoma were recruited and rolled into sevoflurane control group and propofol experimental group. Both were evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images based on deep learning super-resolution algorithms. The results showed that the fractional anisotropic image (FA) value of the hind limb corticospinal tract of the affected side of the internal capsule of the experimental group after the operation was 0.67 +/- 0.28. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 6.14 +/- 3.29. The oxygen saturation in jugular venous (SjvO(2)) at T4 and T5 was 61.93 +/- 6.58% and 59.38 +/- 6.2%, respectively, and cerebral oxygen uptake rate (CO2ER) was 31.12 +/- 6.07% and 35.83 +/- 7.91%, respectively. The difference in jugular venous oxygen (Da-jvO(2)) at T3, T4, and T5 was 63.28 +/- 10.15 mL/dL, 64.89 +/- 13.11 mL/dL, and 66.03 +/- 11.78 mL/dL, respectively. The neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and central-nerve-specific protein (S100 beta) levels at T5 were 53.85 +/- 12.31 ng/mL and 7.49 +/- 3.16 ng/mL, respectively. In terms of the number of postoperative complications, the patients in the experimental group were better than the control group under sevoflurane anesthesia, and the differences were substantial (P < 0.05). In conclusion, MRI images based on deep learning super-resolution algorithm have great clinical value in evaluating the degree of brain injury in patients anesthetized with propofol and the protective effect of propofol on brain nerves.

TI  - Method for evaluating association rule based on            machine learning, involves obtaining evaluation result            reflecting causal relationship between front piece and            back piece in association rule
AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The method involves using an item                co-occurrence condition to excavate an association                rule from an item set (101). The association rule                is provided with a front piece and a back piece. A                pre-trained text information encoder and a                pre-prediction machine are used (102) to perform                feature extraction to collected item text                information. A coding vector representation of the                item text is obtained. The text encoder is used to                predict whether the back piece in the association                rule occurs. The front prediction machine is used                for predicting whether the front piece in an                association rules occurs. An evaluation result                reflecting a causal relationship between the front                and the back pieces in the association rules is                obtained (103).
                    USE - Method for evaluating association rule such as                oral anesthesia, root canal and root canal therapy                based on machine learning in shopping scene,                supermarket product placement, medical scene and                doctor case diagnosis.
                    ADVANTAGE - The method enables evaluating the causality                evaluation aiming at the association rule, thus                improving the interpretability of association                rule.

TI  - Chronic pelvic pain: An underrecognised perioperative consideration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENDOMETRIOSIS AND PELVIC PAIN DISORDERS
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a prevalent disorder amongst women. The physiology of CPP is attributed to various neurophysiological mechanisms and endometriosis, adenomyosis, chronic infection and functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome or interstitial cystitis are all diseases which fall under the umbrella term of CPP. CPP and its associated multitude of causes can affect perioperative care through several mechanisms. Patients with CPP may be more likely to experience significant pain in the perioperative setting and preoperative pain can be a predictor of post-operative pain. Thus, optimisation of CPP prior to the perioperative period is an important consideration. Currently limited and conflicting evidence exists regarding the peri-operative pharmacological analgesia. The various aetiologies of CPP and patient medical history result in the inability to generalise one analgesic regime. Areas of further research includes neuromodulation techniques, genomic and proteomic biomarker studies and the applicability of artificial intelligence.

TI  - Development and prospective validation of postoperative pain prediction from preoperative EHR data using attention-based set embeddings
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Preoperative knowledge of expected postoperative pain can help guide perioperative pain management and focus interventions on patients with the greatest risk of acute pain. However, current methods for predicting postoperative pain require patient and clinician input or laborious manual chart review and often do not achieve sufficient performance. We use routinely collected electronic health record data from a multicenter dataset of 234,274 adult non-cardiac surgical patients to develop a machine learning method which predicts maximum pain scores on the day of surgery and four subsequent days and validate this method in a prospective cohort. Our method, POPS, is fully automated and relies only on data available prior to surgery, allowing application in all patients scheduled for or considering surgery. Here we report that POPS achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms clinician predictions on all postoperative days when predicting maximum pain on the 0-10 NRS in prospective validation, though with degraded calibration. POPS is interpretable, identifying comorbidities that significantly contribute to postoperative pain based on patient-specific context, which can assist clinicians in mitigating cases of acute pain.

AB  - Aortic insufficiency (AI) is a frequent problem after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and results in increased morbidity and mortality. Advances in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) technology have resulted in this being discussed as a potential option for LVAD patients with AI. While small case series have been published, we report the first case of TAVR thrombosis in an LVAD patient. This case highlights a major diagnostic and management dilemma that should become more present if this strategy becomes more widespread.

TI  - Tissue classification in intercostal and paravertebral ultrasound using spectral analysis of radiofrequency backscatter
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Paravertebral and intercostal nerve blocks have experienced a resurgence in popularity. Ultrasound has become the gold standard for visualization of the needle during injection of the analgesic, but the intercostal artery and vein can be difficult to visualize. We investigated the use of spectral analysis of raw radiofrequency (RF) ultrasound signals for identification of the intercostal vessels and six other tissue types in the intercostal and paravertebral spaces. Features derived from the one-dimensional spectrum, two-dimensional spectrum, and cepstrum were used to train four different machine learning algorithms. In addition, the use of the average normalized spectrum as the feature set was compared with the derived feature set. Compared to a support vector machine (SVM) (74.2%), an artificial neural network (ANN) (68.2%), and multinomial analysis (64.1%), a random forest (84.9%) resulted in the most accurate classification. The accuracy using a random forest trained with the first 15 principal components of the average normalized spectrum was 87.0%. These results demonstrate that using a machine learning algorithm with spectral analysis of raw RF ultrasound signals has the potential to provide tissue characterization in intercostal and paravertebral ultrasound.

TI  - Aiding the prescriber: developing a machine learning approach to personalized risk modeling for chronic opioid therapy amongst US Army soldiers
T2  - HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The opioid epidemic is a major policy concern. The widespread availability of opioids, which is fueled by physician prescribing patterns, medication diversion, and the interaction with potential illicit opioid use, has been implicated as proximal cause for subsequent opioid dependence and mortality. Risk indicators related to chronic opioid therapy (COT) at the point of care may influence physicians' prescribing decisions, potentially reducing rates of dependency and abuse. In this paper, we investigate the performance of machine learning algorithms for predicting the risk of COT. Using data on over 12 million observations of active duty US Army soldiers, we apply machine learning models to predict the risk of COT in the initial months of prescription. We use the area under the curve (AUC) as an overall measure of model performance, and we focus on the positive predictive value (PPV), which reflects the models' ability to accurately target military members for intervention. Of the many models tested, AUC ranges between 0.83 and 0.87. When we focus on the top 1% of members at highest risk, we observe a PPV value of 8.4% and 20.3% for months 1 and 3, respectively. We further investigate the performance of sparse models that can be implemented in sparse data environments. We find that when the goal is to identify patients at the highest risk of chronic use, these sparse linear models achieve a performance similar to models trained on hundreds of variables. Our predictive models exhibit high accuracy and can alert prescribers to the risk of COT for the highest risk patients. Optimized sparse models identify a parsimonious set of factors to predict COT: initial supply of opioids, the supply of opioids in the month being studied, and the number of prescriptions for psychotropic medications. Future research should investigate the possible effects of these tools on prescriber behavior (e.g., the benefit of clinician nudging at the point of care in outpatient settings).

TI  - Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting the Recurrence of Stage IV Colorectal Cancer After Tumor Resection
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) technology to predict postoperative recurrence risk among stage IV colorectal cancer patients. Four basic ML algorithms were used for prediction-logistic regression, decision tree, GradientBoosting and lightGBM. The research samples were randomly divided into a training group and a testing group at a ratio of 8:2. 999 patients with stage 4 colorectal cancer were included in this study. In the training group, the GradientBoosting model's AUC value was the highest, at 0.881. The Logistic model's AUC value was the lowest, at 0.734. The GradientBoosting model had the highest F1_score (0.912). In the test group, the AUC Logistic model had the lowest AUC value (0.692). The GradientBoosting model's AUC value was 0.734, which can still predict cancer progress. However, the gbm model had the highest AUC value (0.761), and the gbm model had the highest F1_score (0.974). The GradientBoosting model and the gbm model performed better than the other two algorithms. The weight matrix diagram of the GradientBoosting algorithm shows that chemotherapy, age, LogCEA, CEA and anesthesia time were the five most influential risk factors for tumor recurrence. The four machine learning algorithms can each predict the risk of tumor recurrence in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer after surgery. Among them, GradientBoosting and gbm performed best. Moreover, the GradientBoosting weight matrix shows that the five most influential variables accounting for postoperative tumor recurrence are chemotherapy, age, LogCEA, CEA and anesthesia time.

T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose: To enable accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based dose calculations, synthetic computed tomography (sCT) images need to be generated. We aim at assessing the feasibility of dose calculations from MRI acquired with a heterogeneous set of imaging protocol for paediatric patients affected by brain tumours.Materials and methods: Sixty paediatric patients undergoing brain radiotherapy were included. MR imaging protocols varied among patients, and data heterogeneity was maintained in train/validation/test sets. Three 2D conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) were trained to generate sCT from T1-weighted MRI, considering the three orthogonal planes and its combination (multi-plane sCT). For each patient, median and standard deviation (sigma) of the three views were calculated, obtaining a combined sCT and a proxy for uncertainty map, respectively. The sCTs were evaluated against the planning CT in terms of image similarity and accuracy for photon and proton dose calculations.Results: A mean absolute error of 61 +/- 14 HU (mean +/- 1 sigma) was obtained in the intersection of the body contours between CT and sCT. The combined multi-plane sCTs performed better than sCTs from any single plane. Uncertainty maps highlighted that multi-plane sCTs differed at the body contours and air cavities. A dose difference of -0.1 +/- 0.3% and 0.1 +/- 0.4% was obtained on the D > 90% of the prescribed dose and mean gamma(2%; 2 mm) pass-rate of 99.5 +/- 0.8% and 99.2 +/- 1.1% for photon and proton planning, respectively.Conclusion: Accurate MR-based dose calculation using a combination of three orthogonal planes for sCT generation is feasible for paediatric brain cancer patients, even when training on a heterogeneous dataset.

TI  - The efficacy and effectiveness of machine learning for weaning in mechanically ventilated patients at the intensive care unit: a systematic review
T2  - BIO-DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING
M3  - Review
AB  - Weaning from mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a complex clinical problem and relevant for future organ engineering. Prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV) leads to a range of medical complications that increases length of stay and costs as well as contributes to morbidity and even mortality and long-term quality of life. The need to reduce MV is both clinical and economical. Artificial intelligence or machine learning (ML) methods are promising opportunities to positively influence patient outcomes. ML methods have been proposed to enhance clinical decisions processes by using the large amount of digital information generated in the ICU setting. There is a particular interest in empirical methods (such as ML) to improve management of "difficult-to-wean" patients, due to the associated costs and adverse events associated with this population. A systematic literature search was performed using the OVID, IEEEXplore, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. All publications that included (1) the application of ML to weaning from MV in the ICU and (2) a clinical outcome measurement were reviewed. A checklist to assess the study quality of medical ML publications was modified to suit the critical assessment of ML in MV weaning literature. The systematic search identified nine studies that used ML for weaning management from MV in critical care. The weaning management application areas included (1) prediction of successful spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), (2) prediction of successful extubation, (3) prediction of arterial blood gases, and (4) ventilator setting and oxygenation-adjustment advisory systems. Seven of the nine studies scored seven out of eight on the quality index. The remaining two of the nine studies scored one out of eight on the quality index. This scoring may, in part, be explained by the publications' focus on technical novelty, and therefore focusing on issues most important to a technical audience, instead of issues most important for a systematic medical review. This review showed that only a limited number of studies have started to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of ML for MV in the ICU. However, ML has the potential to be applied to the prediction of SBT failure, extubation failure, and blood gases, and also the adjustment of ventilator and oxygenation settings. The available databases for the development of ML in this clinical area may still be inadequate. None of the reviewed studies reported on the procedure, treatment, or sedation strategy undergone by patients. Such information is unlikely to be required in a technical publication but is potentially vital to the development ML techniques that are sufficiently robust to meet the needs of the "difficult-to-wean" patient population.

TI  - Predicting Intraoperative Hypothermia Burden during Non-Cardiac Surgery: A Retrospective Study Comparing Regression to Six Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia is a common complication that affects patient comfort and morbidity. As the development of hypothermia is a complex phenomenon, predicting it using machine learning (ML) algorithms may be superior to logistic regression. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective study and assembled a feature set comprised of 71 variables. The primary outcome was hypothermia burden, defined as the area under the intraoperative temperature curve below 37 & DEG;C over time. We built seven prediction models (logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB)) to predict whether patients would not develop hypothermia or would develop mild, moderate, or severe hypothermia. For each model, we assessed discrimination (F1 score, area under the receiver operating curve, precision, recall) and calibration (calibration-in-the-large, calibration intercept, calibration slope). Results: We included data from 87,116 anesthesia cases. Predicting the hypothermia burden group using logistic regression yielded a weighted F1 score of 0.397. Ranked from highest to lowest weighted F1 score, the ML algorithms performed as follows: XGBoost (0.44), RF (0.418), LDA (0.406), LDA (0.4), KNN (0.362), and GNB (0.32). Conclusions: ML is suitable for predicting intraoperative hypothermia and could be applied in clinical practice.

TI  - Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery Using Interpretable Machine Learning.
T2  - Anesthesiology and pain medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complication that occurs for various reasons after surgery, especially cardiac surgery. This complication can lead to a prolonged treatment process, increased costs, and sometimes death. Prediction of postoperative AKI can help anesthesiologists to implement preventive and early treatment strategies to reduce the risk of AKI.Objectives: This study tries to predict postoperative AKI using interpretable machine learning models.Methods: For this study, the information of 1435 patients was collected from multiple centers. The gathered data are in six categories: demographic characteristics and type of surgery, past medical history (PMH), drug history (DH), laboratory information, anesthesia and surgery information, and postoperative variables. Machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), logistic regression, XGBoost, and AdaBoost, were used to predict postoperative AKI. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and the Shapley methods were then leveraged to check the interpretability of models.Results: Comparing the area under the curves (AUCs) obtained for different machine learning models show that the RF and XGBoost methods with values of 0.81 and 0.80 best predict postoperative AKI. The interpretations obtained for the machine learning models show that creatinine (Cr), cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB time), blood sugar (BS), and albumin (Alb) have the most significant impact on predictions.Conclusions: The treatment team can be informed about the possibility of postoperative AKI before cardiac surgery using machine learning models such as RF and XGBoost and adjust the treatment procedure accordingly. Interpretability of predictions for each patient ensures the validity of obtained predictions.

TI  - GAN for synthesizing CT from T2-weighted MRI data towards MR-guided radiation treatment
T2  - MAGNETIC RESONANCE MATERIALS IN PHYSICS BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective In medical domain, cross-modality image synthesis suffers from multiple issues, such as context-misalignment, image distortion, image blurriness, and loss of details. The fundamental objective behind this study is to address these issues in estimating synthetic Computed tomography (sCT) scans from T2-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to achieve MRI-guided Radiation Treatment (RT).Materials and methods We proposed a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) with multiple residual blocks to estimate sCT from T2-weighted MRI scans using 367 paired brain MR-CT images dataset. Few state-of-the-art deep learning models were implemented to generate sCT including Pix2Pix model, U-Net model, autoencoder model and their results were compared, respectively.Results Results with paired MR-CT image dataset demonstrate that the proposed model with nine residual blocks in generator architecture results in the smallest mean absolute error (MAE) value of 0.030 +/- 0.017, and mean squared error (MSE) value of 0.010 +/- 0.011, and produces the largest Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) value of 0.954 +/- 0.041, SSIM value of 0.823 +/- 0.063 and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value of 21.422 +/- 3.964, respectively. We qualitatively evaluated our result by visual comparisons of generated sCT to original CT of respective MRI input.Discussion The quantitative and qualitative comparison of this work demonstrates that deep learning-based cGAN model can be used to estimate sCT scan from a reference T2-weighted MRI scan. The overall accuracy of our proposed model outperforms different state-of-the-art deep learning-based models.

TI  - Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury after Liver Transplantation: Machine Learning Approaches vs. Logistic Regression Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) after liver transplantation has been reported to be associated with increased mortality. Recently, machine learning approaches were reported to have better predictive ability than the classic statistical analysis. We compared the performance of machine learning approaches with that of logistic regression analysis to predict AKI after liver transplantation. We reviewed 1211 patients and preoperative and intraoperative anesthesia and surgery-related variables were obtained. The primary outcome was postoperative AKI defined by acute kidney injury network criteria. The following machine learning techniques were used: decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron, and deep belief networks. These techniques were compared with logistic regression analysis regarding the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). AKI developed in 365 patients (30.1%). The performance in terms of AUROC was best in gradient boosting machine among all analyses to predict AKI of all stages (0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.93) or stage 2 or 3 AKI. The AUROC of logistic regression analysis was 0.61 (95% CI 0.56-0.66). Decision tree and random forest techniques showed moderate performance (AUROC 0.86 and 0.85, respectively). The AUROC of support the vector machine, naive Bayes, neural network, and deep belief network was smaller than that of the other models. In our comparison of seven machine learning approaches with logistic regression analysis, the gradient boosting machine showed the best performance with the highest AUROC. An internet-based risk estimator was developed based on our model of gradient boosting. However, prospective studies are required to validate our results.

TI  - Prediction models for chronic postsurgical pain in patients with breast cancer based on machine learning approaches
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis study aimed to develop prediction models for chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) after breast cancer surgery using machine learning approaches and evaluate their performance. MethodsThe study was a secondary analysis based on a high-quality dataset from a randomized controlled trial (NCT00418457), including patients with primary breast cancer undergoing mastectomy. The primary outcome was CPSP at 12 months after surgery, defined as modified Brief Pain Inventory > 0. The dataset was randomly split into a training dataset (90%) and a testing dataset (10%). Variables were selected using recursive feature elimination combined with clinical experience, and potential predictors were then incorporated into three machine learning models, including random forest, gradient boosting decision tree and extreme gradient boosting models for outcome prediction, as well as logistic regression. The performances of these four models were tested and compared. Results1152 patients were finally included, of which 22.1% developed CPSP at 12 months after breast cancer surgery. The 6 leading predictors were higher numerical rating scale within 2 days after surgery, post-menopausal status, urban medical insurance, history of at least one operation, under fentanyl with sevoflurane general anesthesia, and received axillary lymph node dissection. Compared with the multivariable logistic regression model, machine learning models showed better specificity, positive likelihood ratio and positive predictive value, helping to identify high-risk patients more accurately and create opportunities for early clinical intervention. ConclusionsOur study developed prediction models for CPSP after breast cancer surgery based on machine learning approaches, which may help to identify high-risk patients and improve patients' management after breast cancer.

TI  - Prediction of Mortality in Surgical Intensive Care Unit Patients Using Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Predicting prognosis of in-hospital patients is critical. However, it is challenging to accurately predict the life and death of certain patients at certain period. To determine whether machine learning algorithms could predict in-hospital death of critically ill patients with considerable accuracy and identify factors contributing to the prediction power.Materials and Methods: Using medical data of 1,384 patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) of our institution, we investigated whether machine learning algorithms could predict in-hospital death using demographic, laboratory, and other disease-related variables, and compared predictions using three different algorithmic methods. The outcome measurement was the incidence of unexpected postoperative mortality which was defined as mortality without pre-existing not-for-resuscitation order that occurred within 30 days of the surgery or within the same hospital stay as the surgery.Results: Machine learning algorithms trained with 43 variables successfully classified dead and live patients with very high accuracy. Most notably, the decision tree showed the higher classification results (Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve, AUC = 0.96) than the neural network classifier (AUC = 0.80). Further analysis provided the insight that serum albumin concentration, total prenatal nutritional intake, and peak dose of dopamine drug played an important role in predicting the mortality of SICU patients.Conclusion: Our results suggest that machine learning algorithms, especially the decision tree method, can provide information on structured and explainable decision flow and accurately predict hospital mortality in SICU hospitalized patients.

TI  - A Patient-Blinded Randomized, Controlled Trial Comparing Air Insufflation, Water Immersion, and Water Exchange During Minimally Sedated Colonoscopy
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Minimal sedation obviates patient recovery burdens, but intolerable pain limits success of cecal intubation. Painless or minimally uncomfortable insertion ensures success of cecal intubation, current patient satisfaction, and willingness to repeat future colonoscopy with minimal sedation. Water immersion (WI) and water exchange (WE), when separately compared with air insufflation (AI), significantly reduced insertion pain. To assess comparative effectiveness, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with head-to-head comparison of these three methods. We hypothesized that WE could produce the highest proportion of patients reporting painless insertion.METHODS: This prospective patient-blinded trial (NCT01535326) enrolled minimally sedated (25 mg intramuscular meperidine) patients randomized to AI, WI, or WE (90 patients/group) to aid insertion. The previously validated primary outcome was the proportion of patients reporting painless insertion.RESULTS: Painless insertion was reported by 30.0% (AI), 43.3% (WI), and 61.1% (WE) of patients (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that, after adjusting for gender, body mass index, abdominal compression, position change, insertion time to cecum, and length of scope at cecum, only WE was significantly associated with painless insertion compared with AI (odds ratio (OR) = 0.08, 95% confi dence interval (CI) = 0.03-0.24, P < 0.001) or WI (OR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.05-0.40, P < 0.001). Adenoma detection rate (ADR) in the right (cecum and ascending) colon was 11.1% (AI), 14.4% (WI), and 26.7% (WE) (P = 0.015). The limitations included single site study with unblinded colonoscopist and assistant.CONCLUSIONS: This head-to-head comparison of AI vs. WI vs. WE confirmed that WE was superior to WI and AI, with a significantly greater proportion of patients reporting painless insertion. The significantly higher ADR in the right colon in the WE group warrants further investigations.

TI  - Paravertebral block vs. epidural block for percutaneous nephrolithotomy: A prospective, randomized study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) is the main method for urinary calculi. An anesthesia method with little effect on the blood circulation and which does not affect the postoperative activity of a patient is lacking.Objective To compare the effects of paravertebral nerve block (PNB) and epidural block (EPB) on quadriceps femoris muscle (QFM) strength in patients after PCNL.Methods 163 patients were separated into two groups: EPB (81) and PNB (82). Primary outcome parameters were QFM strength and range of motion (RoM) of the knee 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 24 h after anesthesia induction (AI). Secondary outcome parameters were: time from AI beginning to first ambulation; time of sensory-plane recovery; amount of additional analgesics given during and after surgery; prevalence of nausea and vomiting; duration of hospital stay (DoHS); mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) before, 0.5 h, and 1 h after AI; visual analog scale (VAS) score 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 24 h after AI.Results There was no significant difference in QFM strength or knee RoM before or 24 h after AI between the two groups (P > 0.05). The time from AI to first ambulation was shorter (P < 0.05) and the sensory plane took longer to recover (P < 0.05) in the PNB group than in the EPB group. The amount of additional analgesics during surgery was more in the PNB group than in the EPB group (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference after surgery (P > 0.05). VAS scores were higher in the PNB group than in the EPB group 0.5 after AI (P < 0.05). MAP 1 h after AI was higher in the PNB group than in the EPB group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, DoHS, HR, or SpO(2) at 0.5 h and 1 h after AI between the two groups (P > 0.05).Conclusions For patients undergoing PCNL, PNB can meet the need for surgical analgesia while having little effect on QFM strength.

TI  - PreVFs-RG: A Deep Hybrid Model for Identifying Virulence Factors Based on Residual Block and Gated Recurrent Unit
T2  - IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many infectious diseases are caused by bacterial pathogens. The pathogenic mechanisms of bacterial pathogens are complex and it is usually caused by virulence factors (VFs) in many cases. Whether VFs exist is the main difference between the genomes of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, identification of VFs is of great significance for exploring the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. In this paper, we develop a new model for predicting VFs based on multiple features and deep learning. Firstly, we used kmer, Dipeptide deviation from expected mean (DDE) and Amino acid composition (AAC) to extract features. And the deep model is constructed by integrating residual block and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Residual neural network is a kind of jump connection network to avoid gradient explosion or gradient disappearance, which is used to train deeper networks. Two residual blocks, which are separated by Relu activation function and Batch Normalization(BN) layer are used. Finally, the combined features processed by resnet are input into the recurrent structure GRU, and important information is filtered out through reset gate and update gate. The results of the proposed model are better than those of the existing methods by 10-fold cross-validation, and the accuracy is 93.81% and 95.43%, respectively. It shows that the deep hybrid model for identifying virulence factors based on residual block and gate recurrent unit is effective and feasible.

TI  - State-Dependent Cortical Unit Activity Reflects Dynamic Brain State Transitions in Anesthesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effects of anesthesia on cortical neuronal spiking and information transfer could help illuminate the neuronal basis of the conscious state. Recent investigations suggest that the brain state identified by local field potential spectrum is not stationary but changes spontaneously at a fixed level of anesthetic concentration. How cortical unit activity changes with dynamically transitioning brain states under anesthesia is unclear. Extracellular unit activity was measured with 64-channel silicon microelectrode arrays in cortical layers 5/6 of the primary visual cortex of chronically instrumented, freely moving male rats (n = 7) during stepwise reduction of the anesthetic desflurane (6%, 4%, 2%, and 0%). Unsupervised machine learning applied to multiunit spike patterns revealed five distinct brain states. A novel desynchronized brain state with increased spike rate variability, sample entropy, and EMG activity occurred in 6% desflurane with 40.0% frequency. The other four brain states reflected graded levels of anesthesia. As anesthesia deepened the spike rate of neurons decreased regardless of their spike rate profile at baseline conscious state. Actively firing neurons with wide-spiking pattern showed increased bursting activity along with increased spike timing variability, unit-to-population correlation, and unit-to-unit transfer entropy, despite the overall decrease in transfer entropy. The narrow-spiking neurons showed similar changes but to a lesser degree. These results suggest that (1) anesthetic effect on spike rate is distinct from sleep, (2) synchronously fragmented spiking pattern is a signature of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, and (3) the paradoxical, desynchronized brain state in deep anesthesia contends the generally presumed monotonic, dose-dependent anesthetic effect on the brain.

TI  - Knowledge discovery in clinical decision support systems for pain management: A systematic review
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: The occurrence of pain accounts for billions of dollars in annual medical expenditures; loss of quality of life and decreased worker productivity contribute to indirect costs. As pain is highly subjective, clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can be critical for improving the accuracy of pain assessment and offering better support for clinical decision-making. This review is focused on computer technologies for pain management that allow CDSSs to obtain knowledge from the clinical data produced by either patients or health care professionals.Methods and materials: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in several electronic databases to identify relevant articles focused on computerised systems that constituted CDSSs and include data or results related to pain symptoms from patients with acute or chronic pain, published between 1992 and 2011 in the English language. In total, thirty-nine studies were analysed; thirty-two were selected from 1245 citations, and seven were obtained from reference tracking.Results: The results highlighted the following clusters of computer technologies: rule-based algorithms, artificial neural networks, nonstandard set theory, and statistical learning algorithms. In addition, several methodologies were found for content processing such as terminologies, questionnaires, and scores. The median accuracy ranged from 53% to 87.5%.Conclusions: Computer technologies that have been applied in CDSSs are important but not determinant in improving the systems' accuracy and the clinical practice, as evidenced by the moderate correlation among the studies. However, these systems play an important role in the design of computerised systems oriented to a patient's symptoms as is required for pain management. Several limitations related to CDSSs were observed: the lack of integration with mobile devices, the reduced use of web-based interfaces, and scarce capabilities for data to be inserted by patients.

TI  - Geometric morphometrics and machine learning from three-dimensional facial scans for difficult mask ventilation prediction
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Unanticipated difficult mask ventilation (DMV) is a potentially life-threatening event in anesthesia. Nevertheless, predicting DMV currently remains a challenge. This study aimed to verify whether three dimensional (3D) facial scans could predict DMV in patients scheduled for general anesthesia.Methods The 3D facial scans were taken on 669 adult patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. Clinical variables currently used as predictors of DMV were also collected. The DMV was defined as the inability to provide adequate and stable ventilation. Spatially dense landmarks were digitized on 3D scans to describe sufficient details for facial features and then processed by 3D geometric morphometrics. Ten different machine learning (ML) algorithms, varying from simple to more advanced, were introduced. The performance of ML models for DMV prediction was compared with that of the DIFFMASK score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) with its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) as well as the specificity and sensitivity were used to evaluate the predictive value of the model.Results The incidence of DMV was 35/669 (5.23%). The logistic regression (LR) model performed best among the 10 ML models. The AUC of the LR model was 0.825 (95% CI, 0.765-0.885). The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 0.829 (95% CI, 0.629-0.914) and 0.733 (95% CI, 0.532-0.819), respectively. The LR model demonstrated better predictive performance than the DIFFMASK score, which obtained an AUC of 0.785 (95% CI, 0.710-0.860) and a sensitivity of 0.686 (95% CI, 0.578-0.847). Notably, we identified a significant morphological difference in the mandibular region between the DMV group and the easy mask ventilation group.Conclusion Our study indicated a distinct morphological difference in the mandibular region between the DMV group and the easy mask ventilation group. 3D geometric morphometrics with ML could be a rapid, efficient, and non-invasive tool for DMV prediction to improve anesthesia safety.

TI  - A new decision support model for preanesthetic evaluation
T2  - COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objective: The principal challenges in the field of anesthesia and intensive care consist of reducing both anesthetic risks and mortality rate. The ASA score plays an important role in patients' preanesthetic evaluation. In this paper, we propose a methodology to derive simple rules which classify patients in a category of the ASA scale on the basis of their medical characteristics.Methods: This diagnosis system is based on MR-Sort, a multiple criteria decision analysis model. The proposed method intends to support two steps in this process. The first is the assignment of an ASA score to the patient; the second concerns the decision to accept-or not-the patient for surgery.Results: In order to learn the model parameters and assess its effectiveness, we use a database containing the parameters of 898 patients who underwent preanesthesia evaluation. The accuracy of the learned models for predicting the ASA score and the decision of accepting the patient for surgery is assessed and proves to be better than that of other machine learning methods. Furthermore, simple decision rules can be explicitly derived from the learned model. These are easily interpretable by doctors, and their consistency with medical knowledge can be checked.Conclusions: The proposed model for assessing the ASA score produces accurate predictions on the basis of the (limited) set of patient attributes in the database available for the tests. Moreover, the learned MR-Sort model allows for easy interpretation by providing human-readable classification rules. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Intensive Care Unit, the sedation level of patients is usually monitored by periodically assessing the behavioral response to stimuli. However, these clinical assessments are limited due to the disruption with patients' sleep and the noise of observing behaviors instead of the brain activity directly. Here we train a Gated Recurrent Unit using the spectrogram of electroencephalography (EEG) based on 166 mechanically ventilated patients to predict the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score, scored as ordinal levels of -5, -4, ... up to 0. The model is able to predict 50% accurate with an error not larger than 1 level; and 80% accurate with an error not larger than 2 levels on hold-out testing patients. We show typical spectrograms in each sedation level and interpret the results based on the visualization of the gradient with respect to the spectrogram. Future improvements include utilizing the EEG waveforms since waveform patterns are clinically thought to be associated with sedation levels, as well as training patient specific models.

AB  - The widely used American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA PS) classification is subjective, requires manual clinician review to score, and has limited granularity. Our objective was to develop a system that automatically generates an ASA PS with finer granularity by creating a continuous ASA PS score. Supervised machine learning methods were used to create a model that predicts a patient's ASA PS on a continuous scale using the patient's home medications and comorbidities. Three different types of predictive models were trained: regression models, ordinal models, and classification models. The performance and agreement of each model to anesthesiologists were compared by calculating the mean squared error (MSE), rounded MSE and Cohen's Kappa on a holdout set. To assess model performance on continuous ASA PS, model rankings were compared to two anesthesiologists on a subset of ASA PS 3 case pairs. The random forest regression model achieved the best MSE and rounded MSE. A model consisting of three random forest classifiers (split model) achieved the best Cohen's Kappa. The model's agreement with our anesthesiologists on the ASA PS 3 case pairs yielded fair to moderate Kappa values. The results suggest that the random forest split classification model can predict ASA PS with agreement similar to that of anesthesiologists reported in literature and produce a continuous score in which agreement in accurately judging granularity is fair to moderate.

AB  - The continuous progress of mobile Internet technology has led to many new media products, short video is one of them. Its rapid rise has provided the public with rich and colorful entertainment enjoyment, but also brought about the negative function of "mental anesthesia". By using case analysis method, taking Video Tremolo (also named as Tik Tok) APP as an example, combining with innovation and diffusion, use and satisfaction, information cocoon room, gatekeeper and other theories, this paper explores the mechanism and ways of mobile short video application and its "anesthesia" function to the public. The study found that short video APP focuses on spreading content with "magic" through the utilization of big data and artificial intelligence technology to precisely "anesthetize" the public, and expands its scope of influence under the "social +" model. This paper holds that the public should rationally view the explosive phenomenon of short video. The developers of short video APP should use various technical means to guide and manage users' time control, in order to minimize the impact and harm of short video on public "psycho-anesthesia".

TI  - Noninvasive Tracking of Every Individual in Unmarked Mouse Groups Using Multi-Camera Fusion and Deep Learning
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and efficient methods for identifying and tracking each animal in a group are needed to study complex behaviors and social interactions. Traditional tracking methods (e.g., marking each animal with dye or surgically implanting microchips) can be invasive and may have an impact on the social behavior being measured. To overcome these shortcomings, video-based methods for tracking unmarked animals, such as fruit flies and zebrafish, have been developed. However, tracking individual mice in a group remains a challenging problem because of their flexible body and complicated interaction patterns. In this study, we report the development of a multi-object tracker for mice that uses the Faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) deep learning algorithm with geometric transformations in combination with multi-camera/multi-image fusion technology. The system successfully tracked every individual in groups of unmarked mice and was applied to investigate chasing behavior. The proposed system constitutes a step forward in the noninvasive tracking of individual mice engaged in social behavior.

TI  - Can a validated sleep apnea scoring system predict cardiopulmonary events using propofol sedation for routine EGD or colonoscopy? A prospective cohort study
T2  - GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is linked to the prevalence of obesity, continues to rise in the United States. There are limited data on the risk for sedation-related adverse events (SRAE) in patients with undiagnosed OSA receiving propofol for routine EGD and colonoscopy.Objective: To identify the prevalence of OSA by using the STOP-BANG questionnaire (SB) and subsequent risk factors for airway interventions (AI) and SRAE in patients undergoing elective EGD and colonoscopy.Design: Prospective cohort study.Setting: Tertiary-care teaching hospital.Patients: A total of 243 patients undergoing routine EGD or colonoscopy at Cleveland Clinic.Intervention: Chin lift, mask ventilation, placement of nasopharyngeal airway, bag mask ventilation, unplanned endotracheal intubation, hypoxia, hypotension, or early procedure termination.Main Outcome Measurements: Rates of AI and SRAE.Results: Mean age of the cohort was 50 +/- 16.2 years, and 41% were male. The prevalence of SB+ was 48.1%. The rates of hypoxia (11.2% vs 16.9%; P = .20) and hypotension (10.4% vs 5.9%; P = .21) were similar between SB- and SB+ patients. An SB score >= 3 was found not to be associated with occurrence of AI (relative risk [RR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-1.5) or SRAE (RR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.53-1.2) after we adjusted for total and loading dose of propofol, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and age. Higher BMI was associated with an increased risk for AI (RR 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04) and SRAE (RR 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05). Increased patient age (RR 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.2), higher loading propofol doses (RR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8), and smoking (RR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9) were associated with higher rates of SRAE.Limitations: Non-randomized study.Conclusion: A significant number of patients undergoing routine EGD and colonoscopy are at risk for OSA. SB +/- patients are not at higher risk for AI or SRAE. However, other risk factors for AI and SRAE have been identified and must be taken into account to optimize patient safety.

AB  - The focus of several clinical trials and research in the area of clinical pharmacology is to fine tune the drug dosing in the phase of additive, antagonistic, and synergistic drug interactive effects. It is important to consider the interactive effects of the drugs to restrict the drug usage to the optimal level required to achieve certain therapeutic effects. Such optimal drug dosing methods will minimize the adverse drug effects and cost associated with the treatment. In this paper, we discuss the use of a reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller to fine tune the drug titration while different drugs with interactive effects are administrated simultaneously. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by using 25 simulated patients for the simultaneous infusion of a sedative and analgesic drug which has synergistic interactive effect.

TI  - Application possibilities of digital tools in postoperative pain therapy
T2  - SCHMERZ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recently, digital tools, such as smartphone-based applications and the use of artificial intelligence have increasingly found their way into pain medicine. This could enable new treatment approaches in postoperative pain management. Therefore, this article provides an overview of various digital tools and their potential application options in postoperative pain management.Material and methods: An orienting literature search was carried out in the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases, and a targeted selection of essential key publications was made in order to provide a structured presentation of different current possible applications and a discussion based on the most recent knowledge.Results: Today, possible applications of digital tools, even if they mostly have only a model character, include pain documentation and assessment, patient self-management and education, pain prediction, decision support for medical staff, and supportive pain therapy, for example in the form of virtual reality and videos. These tools offer advantages such as individualized treatment concepts, addressing specific patient groups, reduction of pain and analgesics, and the potential for early warning or detection of postoperative pain. Furthermore, the challenges of the technical implementation and appropriate user training are highlighted.Conclusion: The use of digital tools, although so far integrated in clinical routine in a relatively selective and exemplary manner, promises to be an innovative approach for personalized postoperative pain therapy in the future. Future studies and projects should help to integrate the promising research approaches into everyday clinical practice.

TI  - Face and content validity of variables associated with the difficult-to-sedate child in the paediatric intensive care unit: A survey of paediatric critical care clinicians
T2  - AUSTRALIAN CRITICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Clinicians recognise that some critically ill children are difficult-to-sedate. It may be possible to identify this clinical phenotype for sedation response using statistical modelling techniques adopted from machine learning. This requires identification of a finite number of variables to include in the statistical model.Objective: To establish face and content validity for 17 candidate variables identified in the international literature as characteristic of the difficult-to-sedate child phenotype.Methods: Paediatric critical care clinicians rated the relevance of 17 variables characterising the difficult-to-sedate child using a four-point scale ranging from not (1) to highly relevant (4). Face and content validity of these variables were assessed by calculating a mean score for each item and computing an item-level content validity index. Items with a mean score > 1 were rated as having adequate face validity. An item-level content validity index >= 0.70 indicated good to excellent content validity. Setting and participants: Web-based survey emailed to members of the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators Network or the Society of Critical Care Medicine Pediatric Sedation Study Group.Results: Of 411 possible respondents, 121 useable surveys were returned for a response rate of 29%. All items had a mean score > 1, indicating adequate face validity. Ten of 17 items scored an item-level content validity index >= 0.70. The highest scoring items were requiring three or more sedation classes simultaneously, daily modal sedation score indicating agitation, sedation score indicating agitation for 2 consecutive hours, receiving sedatives at a dose > 90th percentile of the usual starting dose, and receiving intermittent paralytic doses for sedation.Conclusions: Computation of an item-level content validity index validated variables to include in statistical modelling of the difficult-to-sedate phenotype. The results indicate consensus among paediatric critical care clinicians that the majority of candidate variables identified through literature review are characteristic of the difficult-to-sedate child.

TI  - COVID-19 implications for pediatric anesthesia: Lessons learnt and how to prepare for the next pandemic
T2  - PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - COVID-19 is mainly considered an "adult pandemic," but it also has strong implications for children and consequently for pediatric anesthesia. Despite the lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection being directly correlated with age, children have equally experienced the negative impacts of this pandemic. In fact, the spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms among children ranges from very mild to those resembling adults, but may also present as a multisystemic inflammatory syndrome. Moreover, the vast majority of children might be affected by asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infection making them the "perfect" carriers for spreading the disease in the community. Beyond the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the COVID-19 pandemic may ultimately have catastrophic health and socioeconomic consequences for children and adolescents, which are yet to be defined. The aim of this narrative review is to highlight how COVID-19 pandemic has affected and changed the pediatric anesthesia practice and which lessons are to be learned in case of a future "pandemic." In particular, the rapid evolution and dissemination of research and clinical findings have forced the scientific community to adapt and alter clinical practice on an unseen and pragmatic manner. Equally, implementation of new platforms, techniques, and devices together with artificial intelligence and large-scale collaborative efforts may present a giant step for mankind. The valuable lessons of this pandemic will ultimately translate into new treatments modalities for various diseases but will also have the potential for safety improvement and better quality of care. However, this pandemic has revealed the vulnerability and deficiencies of our health-care system. If not addressed properly, we may end up with a tsunami of burnout and compassionate fatigue among health-care professionals. Pediatric anesthesia and critical care staff are no exceptions.

TI  - Perfusion index, intraocular pressure, and hemodynamic responses on insertion of endotracheal tube, Air-Q<SUP>®</SUP> and Ambu<SUP>®</SUP> Aura-IT in ophthalmic surgeries: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - ANAESTHESIA PAIN & INTENSIVE CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Different supraglottic devices have been used with general anesthesia to avoid the disadvantages of endotracheal intubation (ET), especially the pressor response. We assessed the safety and efficacy of the air-Q((R)) (AQ) and Ambu((R)) Aura-i(TM) (AI) devices compared to ET during ophthalmic operations under general anesthesia.Methodology: This randomized clinical trial enrolled 96 adult patients undergoing elective ophthalmic surgeries who were allocated into three groups: the AQ, AI, and ET, according to the airway device used. The perfusion index, blood pressure, heart rate, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured before and after the airway device was inserted. The primary outcome was the change in perfusion index, whereas the secondary outcomes included the ease of insertion and changes in the hemodynamic parameters and IOP.Results. Following the insertion of airway devices, the perfusion index decreased significantly in the ET group compared to the AQ and AI groups (P < 0.001). Significant increases in the heart rate, blood pressure, and IOP were observed in the ET group relative to the other groups (P < 0.001). The IOP following insertion of AI was significantly lower than AQ in the first two minutes post-insertion (P < 0.001). The AI device was significantly easier to be inserted than the AQ device (P < 0.001).Conclusion. Both AI and AQ were reliable and effective in avoiding pressor stress response and increased IOP during general anesthesia, which are desirable targets during operative procedures, especially ophthalmic surgeries. The AI was superior to AQ in terms of IOP fluctuations and the ease of insertion.

TI  - Opioid-related harms and care impacts of conventional and AI-based prescription management strategies: insights from leveraging agent-based modeling and machine learning
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionLike its counterpart to the south, Canada ranks among the top five countries with the highest rates of opioid prescriptions. With many suffering from opioid use disorder first having encountered opioids via prescription routes, practitioners and health systems have an enduring need to identify and effectively respond to the problematic use of opioid prescription. There are strong challenges to successfully addressing this need: importantly, the patterns of prescription fulfillment that signal opioid abuse can be subtle and difficult to recognize, and overzealous enforcement can deprive those with legitimate pain management needs the appropriate care. Moreover, injudicious responses risk shifting those suffering from early-stage abuse of prescribed opioids to illicitly sourced street alternatives, whose varying dosage, availability, and the risk of adulteration can pose grave health risks. MethodsThis study employs a dynamic modeling and simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of prescription regimes employing machine learning monitoring programs to identify the patients who are at risk of opioid abuse while being treated with prescribed opioids. To this end, an agent-based model was developed and implemented to examine the effect of reduced prescribing and prescription drug monitoring programs on overdose and escalation to street opioids among patients, and on the legitimacy of fulfillments of opioid prescriptions over a 5-year time horizon. A study released by the Canadian Institute for Health Information was used to estimate the parameter values and assist in the validation of the existing agent-based model. Results and discussionThe model estimates that lowering the prescription doses exerted the most favorable impact on the outcomes of interest over 5 years with a minimum burden on patients with a legitimate need for pharmaceutical opioids. The accurate conclusion about the impact of public health interventions requires a comprehensive set of outcomes to test their multi-dimensional effects, as utilized in this research. Finally, combining machine learning and agent-based modeling can provide significant advantages, particularly when using the latter to gain insights into the long-term effects and dynamic circumstances of the former.

TI  - Closed-loop anesthesia
T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Automated anesthesia which may offer to the physician time to control hemodynamic and to supervise neurological outcome and which may offer to the patient safety and quality was until recently consider as a holy grail. But this field of research is now increasing in every component of general anesthesia (hypnosis, nociception, neuromuscular blockade) and literature describes some successful algorithms - single or multi closed-loop controller. The aim of these devices is to control a predefined target and to continuously titrate anesthetics whatever the patients' comorbidities and surgical events to reach this target. Literature contains many randomized trials comparing manual and automated anesthesia and shows feasibility and safety of this system. Automation could quickly concern other aspects of anesthesia as fluid management and this review proposes an overview of closed-loop systems in anesthesia.

TI  - Predicting brain function status changes in critically ill patients via Machine learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: In intensive care units (ICUs), a patient's brain function status can shift from a state of acute brain dysfunction (ABD) to one that is ABD-free and vice versa, which is challenging to forecast and, in turn, hampers the allocation of hospital resources. We aim to develop a machine learning model to predict next-day brain function status changes.Materials and Methods: Using multicenter prospective adult cohorts involving medical and surgical ICU patients from 2 civilian and 3 Veteran Affairs hospitals, we trained and externally validated a light gradient boosting machine to predict brain function status changes. We compared the performances of the boosting model against state-of-the-art models-an ABD predictive model and its variants. We applied Shapley additive explanations to identify influential factors to develop a compact model.Results: There were 1026 critically ill patients without evidence of prior major dementia, or structural brain diseases, from whom 12 295 daily transitions (ABD: 5847 days; ABD-free: 6448 days) were observed. The boosting model achieved an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.824 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.821-0.827), compared with the state-of-the-art models of 0.697 (95% CI, 0.693-0.701) with P< .001. Using 13 identified top influential factors, the compact model achieved 99.4% of the boosting model on AUROC. The boosting and the compact models demonstrated high generalizability in external validation by achieving an AUROC of 0.812 (95% CI, 0.812-0.813).Conclusion: The inputs of the compact model are based on several simple questions that clinicians can quickly answer in practice, which demonstrates the model has direct prospective deployment potential into clinical practice, aiding in critical hospital resource allocation.

TI  - An Automatically Adaptive Digital Health Intervention to Decrease Opioid-Related Risk While Conserving Counselor Time: Quantitative Analysis of Treatment Decisions Based on Artificial Intelligence and Patient-Repor ted Risk Measures
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Some patients prescribed opioid analgesic (OA) medications for pain experience serious side effects, including dependence, sedation, and overdose. As most patients are at low risk for OA-related harms, risk reduction interventions requiring multiple counseling sessions are impractical on a large scale.Objective: This study evaluates whether an intervention based on reinforcement learning (RL), a field of artificial intelligence, learned through experience to personalize interactions with patients with pain discharged from the emergency department (ED) and decreased self-reported OA misuse behaviors while conserving counselors' time.Methods: We used data representing 2439 weekly interactions between a digital health intervention ("Prescription Opioid Wellness and Engagement Research in the ED" [PowerED]) and 228 patients with pain discharged from 2 EDs who reported recent opioid misuse. During each patient's 12 weeks of intervention, PowerED used RL to select from 3 treatment options: a brief motivational message delivered via an interactive voice response (IVR) call, a longer motivational IVR call, or a live call from a counselor. The algorithm selected session types for each patient each week, with the goal of minimizing OA risk, defined in terms of a dynamic score reflecting patient reports during IVR monitoring calls. When a live counseling call was predicted to have a similar impact on future risk as an IVR message, the algorithm favored IVR to conserve counselor time. We used logit models to estimate changes in the relative frequency of each session type as PowerED gained experience. Poisson regression was used to examine the changes in self-reported OA risk scores over calendar time, controlling for the ordinal session number (1st to 12th).Results: Participants on average were 40 (SD 12.7) years of age; 66.7% (152/228) were women and 51.3% (117/228) were unemployed. Most participants (175/228, 76.8%) reported chronic pain, and 46.2% (104/225) had moderate to severe depressive symptoms. As PowerED gained experience through interactions over a period of 142 weeks, it delivered fewer live counseling sessions than brief IVR sessions (P=.006) and extended IVR sessions (P<.001). Live counseling sessions were selected 33.5% of the time in the first 5 weeks of interactions (95% CI 27.4%-39.7%) but only for 16.4% of sessions (95% CI 12.7%-20%) after 125 weeks. Controlling for each patient's changes during the course of treatment, this adaptation of treatment-type allocation led to progressively greater improvements in self-reported OA risk scores (P<.001) over calendar time, as measured by the number of weeks since enrollment began. Improvement in risk behaviors over time was especially pronounced among patients with the highest risk at baseline (P=.02).Conclusions: The RL-supported program learned which treatment modalities worked best to improve self-reported OA risk behaviors while conserving counselors' time. RL-supported interventions represent a scalable solution for patients with pain receiving OA prescriptions.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02990377; https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02990377

TI  - LUMBAR ULTRASOUND IMAGE FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION WITH SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Needle entry site localization remains a challenge for procedures that involve lumbar puncture, for example, epidural anesthesia. To solve the problem, we have developed an image classification algorithm that can automatically identify the bone/interspinous region for ultrasound images obtained from lumbar spine of pregnant patients in the transverse plane. The proposed algorithm consists of feature extraction, feature selection and machine learning procedures. A set of features, including matching values, positions and the appearance of black pixels within pre-defined windows along the midline, were extracted from the ultrasound images using template matching and midline detection methods. A support vector machine was then used to classify the bone images and interspinous images. The support vector machine model was trained with 1,040 images from 26 pregnant subjects and tested on 800 images from a separate set of 20 pregnant patients. A success rate of 95.0% on training set and 93.2% on test set was achieved with the proposed method. The trained support vector machine model was further tested on 46 off-line collected videos, and successfully identified the proper needle insertion site (interspinous region) in 45 of the cases. Therefore, the proposed method is able to process the ultrasound images of lumbar spine in an automatic manner, so as to facilitate the anesthetists' work of identifying the needle entry site.

TI  - Identification of a Novel <i>FAM83H</i> Mutation and Management of Hypocalcified Amelogenesis Imperfecta in Early Childhood
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a heterogeneous group of rare genetic disorders affecting amelogenesis during dental development. Therefore, the molecular genetic etiology of AI can provide information about the nature and progress of the disease. To confirm the genetic etiology of AI in a Korean family with an autosomal dominant inheritance, pedigree and mutational analyses were performed. DNA was isolated from the participating family members and whole-exome sequencing was performed with the DNA sample of the father of the proband. The identified mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The mutational analysis revealed a novel nonsense mutation in the FAM83H gene (NM_198488.5: c.1363C > T, p.(Gln455*)), confirming autosomal dominant hypocalcified AI. Full-mouth restorative treatments of the affected children were performed after the completion of the deciduous dentition. Early diagnosis of AI can be useful for understanding the nature of the disease and for managing the condition and treatment planning.

TI  - A machine learning method for acute hypotensive episodes prediction using only non-invasive parameters
T2  - COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: Accurate prediction of acute hypotensive episodes (AHE) is fundamentally important for timely and appropriate clinical decision-making, as it can provide medical professionals with sufficient time to accurately select more efficient therapeutic interventions for each specific condition. However, existing methods are invasive, easily affected by artifacts and can be difficult to acquire in a pre-hospital setting.Methods: In this study, 1055 patients' records were extracted from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database (MIMIC II), comprising of 388 AHE records and 667 non-AHE records. Six commonly used machine learning algorithms were selected and used to develop an AHE prediction model based on features extracted from seven types of non-invasive physiological parameters. Results: The optimal observation window and prediction gap were selected as 300 minutes and 60 minutes, respectively. For GBDT, XGB and AdaBoost, the optimal feature subsets contained only 39% of the overall features. An ensemble prediction model was developed using the voting method to achieve a more robust performance with an accuracy (ACC) of 0.822 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.878.Conclusion: A novel machine learning method that uses only noninvasive physiological parameters offers a promising solution for easy and prompt AHE prediction in widespread scenario applications, including pre-hospital and in-hospital care.(c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Optimizing Efficiency and Quality of Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer using Machine Learning Based Automation
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Current treatment planning for brachytherapy of cervical cancer is performed with manual techniques that areboth time-consuming and subjective. Manual treatment planning takes 95 minutes on average and occurswhile patients are sedated, and the quality of the treatments is highly dependent on the expertise of thephysician. Unfortunately, the resource intensiveness and need for specialized expertise are barriers toimplementation of brachytherapy, and as a result many centers are not offering this essential treatment forcervical cancer. Alarmingly, this rapid decline in brachytherapy utilization has been linked to 12% reductions inpatient survival. To overcome the barriers to delivering highly effective brachytherapy, there is a critical needfor tools that improve the efficiency and reduce the complexity of treatment planning for each patient. My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on automating brachytherapy cancer treatmentwith machine learning, producing button-click solutions that will significantly upgrade the quality ofbrachytherapy and combat declining utilization. I have significant experience in modeling, image processingand computer programming and I want to build on this skillset with a training program that will prepare me forindependence. I have assembled an exceptional mentorship team, which includes expertise in machinelearning, clinical trials, implementation science and statistics. We formed a training plan to gain expertise in (1)deep learning, (2) advanced statistical analysis, (3) design of clinical trials and implementation of technologyand (4) research career development. The research goal of this proposal is to develop a tool for fullyautomated cervical brachytherapy treatment planning, which uses machine learning models to makepredictions for new patients. The central hypothesis is that automated planning using machine learning willgenerate non-inferior or even superior plans in significantly reduced treatment planning time. This hypothesiswill be tested with the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning models, which use labelled patientimages to predict radiation dose; (2) Develop and evaluate efficacy of a pipeline for automated brachytherapyplanning; and (3) Prospectively measure the efficiency and clinical impact of automated brachytherapyplanning. For Aim 1, convolutional neural networks will be developed to predict 3D radiation dose fromimaging. Aim 2 will convert predicted doses into deliverable treatment plans using gradient-descentoptimization to determine optimal treatment parameters. Aim 3 will provide an end-to-end validation of theautomated planning by testing it in real-time clinical workflow. This work is innovative because it presents thefirst clinical validation of an automated treatment planning system for brachytherapy of cervical cancer. Theproposed research is significant because it will revolutionize the current brachytherapy paradigm by applyingmachine learning to automate and standardize time-consuming, manual processes. This work is a key steptowards my future R01 submission on multi-institutional implementation of automated cervical brachytherapy.

M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - Orthopedic surgery and care during the perioperative period are the key to the treatment of orthopedic diseases, which can quickly and effectively treat orthopedic diseases and can quickly recover during the perioperative period. Therefore, this paper focuses on the observation of the effect of intelligent machine-assisted surgery and perioperative care, combined with smart wearable devices and C-arm camera calibration; the details of the bone surgery are assisted by the machine, and then the recognition ability is accelerated by writing into the digital bone bank. Based on machine vision, CNN training and learning are designed to design a machine-assisted perioperative nursing method. This paper also designed a bone surgery test experiment and perioperative adverse event data analysis, combined with the data obtained from the experiment, designed a comparison experiment with traditional surgery and perioperative nursing. The experimental results show that the success rate of machine-assisted surgery is increased by nearly 2%-15% compared with traditional surgery; and the rehabilitation degree of machine-assisted perioperative nursing is 15.83% higher than that of traditional perioperative nursing.

TI  - ORS-ISFR 17th Biennial Conference: Thinking big on fracture repair
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - AbstractBone fractures occur in more than 25 million Americans per year, and a significant percentage of thosefractures fail to heal. Fractures that show delayed or failed progression to heal account for the majority ofpatient disability and costs. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the biology of bone healing, andto use that knowledge to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics. We are seeking support for the 17thBiennial conference of the International Section of Fracture Repair (ISFR). The ISFR recently becameincorporated as a section within the Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) thereby leveraging the outreach ofthe largest scientific organization in the world dedicated to orthopaedic research. The ISFR is dedicated to theadvancement and exchange of the most current scientific ideas and research findings on fracture repair and itsapplication to the improvement of patient care. Our mission is be the premier forum to integrate and presentcutting-edge ideas related to clinical, translational, and basic science research of fracture healing. The centraltheme for this conference is “Thinking Big”. We will present the use of -omics approaches to solve the mostsignificant research problems in the field and large-scale data management and advanced computationalapproaches to solve intractable clinical concerns. The meeting is organized around seven scientific sessions,and also includes an embedded symposium conducted with the Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA)focused on non-unions and a collaborative session on proximal humeral fractures conducted with the Boneand Joint Institute of the University of Western Ontario (BJI). The scientific sessions will each have a series ofspeakers, selected from submitted abstracts, and each will have an eminent keynote invited speaker. Thesessions include: Stem Cells in Fracture; Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big data; Fractureinduced pain management; Fracture repair basic research; Fracture repair clinical perspectives; Bone repairwith polytrauma; and Outcomes.

TI  - Factors Associated With Adenoma Detection in Propofol-sedated Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Goals: To assess the factors associated with adenoma detection in propofol-sedated patients. Backgrounds: Low adenoma detection rate (ADR) are linked to increased risk of interval cancer and related deaths. Compared with air insufflation (AI) colonoscopy, the method of water exchange (WE) significantly decreased insertion pain and increased ADR in unsedated patients. Deep sedation with propofol has been increasingly used in colonoscopy. One report suggested that WE significantly increased ADR in propofol-sedated patients, but the factors associated with adenoma detection were not analyzed. Study: Post hoc multiple logistic regression analyses were performed based on pooled data from 2 randomized controlled trials to assess the factors associated with adenoma detection in propofol-sedated patients. Results: Propofol-sedated patients (n=510) were randomized to AI and WE. The baseline characteristics were comparable. Multiple logistic regression analyses show that age, withdrawal time, indications (screening vs. diagnostic), and WE were significantly and independently associated with higher ADR. WE had fewer patients with inadequate Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score of <6. Despite a significantly shorter inspection time, WE had significantly higher overall ADR than AI, especially in those with adequate Boston Bowel Preparation Scale of >= 6. Right colon ADR (17.5% vs. 10.5%), flat ADR (32.3% vs. 19.4%), combined advanced and sessile serrated ADR (13.1% vs. 7.4%) of WE were significantly higher than those of AI. Conclusions: WE enhanced quality of colonoscopy in propofol-sedated patients by significantly improving colon cleanliness and overall ADR. Colonoscopists with patients under propofol sedation might consider evaluating WE method for performance improvement.

TI  - Neural Machine Translation-Based Automated Current Procedural Terminology Classification System Using Procedure Text: Development and Validation Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Administrative costs for billing and insurance-related activities in the United States are substantial. One critical cause of the high overhead of administrative costs is medical billing errors. With advanced deep learning techniques, developing advanced models to predict hospital and professional billing codes has become feasible. These models can be used for administrative cost reduction and billing process improvements.Objective: In this study, we aim to develop an automated anesthesiology current procedural terminology (CPT) prediction system that translates manually entered surgical procedure text into standard forms using neural machine translation (NMT) techniques. The standard forms are calculated using similarity scores to predict the most appropriate CPT codes. Although this system aims to enhance medical billing coding accuracy to reduce administrative costs, we compare its performance with that of previously developed machine learning algorithms.Methods: We collected and analyzed all operative procedures performed at Michigan Medicine between January 2017 and June 2019 (2.5 years). The first 2 years of data were used to train and validate the existing models and compare the results from the NMT-based model. Data from 2019 (6-month follow-up period) were then used to measure the accuracy of the CPT code prediction. Three experimental settings were designed with different data types to evaluate the models. Experiment 1 used the surgical procedure text entered manually in the electronic health record. Experiment 2 used preprocessing of the procedure text. Experiment 3 used preprocessing of the combined procedure text and preoperative diagnoses. The NMT-based model was compared with the support vector machine (SVM) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models.Results: The NMT model yielded the highest top-1 accuracy in experiments 1 and 2 at 81.64% and 81.71% compared with the SVM model (81.19% and 81.27%, respectively) and the LSTM model (80.96% and 81.07%, respectively). The SVM model yielded the highest top-1 accuracy of 84.30% in experiment 3, followed by the LSTM model (83.70%) and the NMT model (82.80%). In experiment 3, the addition of preoperative diagnoses showed 3.7%, 3.2%, and 1.3% increases in the SVM, LSTM, and NMT models in top-1 accuracy over those in experiment 2, respectively. For top-3 accuracy, the SVM, LSTM, and NMT models achieved 95.64%, 95.72%, and 95.60% for experiment 1, 95.75%, 95.67%, and 95.69% for experiment 2, and 95.88%, 95.93%, and 95.06% for experiment 3, respectively.Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of creating an automated anesthesiology CPT classification system based on NMT techniques using surgical procedure text and preoperative diagnosis. Our results show that the performance of the NMT-based CPT prediction system is equivalent to that of the SVM and LSTM prediction models. Importantly, we found that including preoperative diagnoses improved the accuracy of using the procedure text alone.

T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Perioperative traumatic stress is a systemic nonspecific response caused by stimuli such as anesthesia, surgery, pain and anxiety, which lasts throughout the perioperative period.The continuous excessive stress response is not conducive to the postoperative rehabilitation of patients. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), a research hotspot of modern surgery, can significantly reduce perioperative pain and stress, thus promoting the rehabilitation of patients. With the progress of artificial intelligence and information technology, wearable, non-invasive, real-time heart rate variability (HRV) dynamic monitoring can effectively realize the digitalization of stress monitoring with low price, which is worthy of clinical application. Therefore, the use of HRV for digital monitoring of perioperative stress has a significant research value. Moreover, the combination of HRV and ERAS has shown its advantages and the prospect of clinical application is worthy of anticipating.
AB  - 围手术期创伤应激是由麻醉、手术、疼痛、焦虑等刺激导致的一种全身性非特异性反应，贯穿整个围手术期，持续而过度的应激反应不利于患者术后康复。加速康复外科（ERAS）是现代外科的研究热点，ERAS可显著降低围手术期疼痛和应激，促进患者康复。但既往ERAS的研究中，通过皮质醇、炎性指标等参数对围手术期应激的评估既低效又不够客观准确。随着人工智能和信息技术的进步，可穿戴、无创、实时动态的心率变异度（HRV）监测可高效实现应激的数字化，且价格低，值得临床推广利用。HRV数字化监测围手术期应激与ERAS的联合运用研究已经显示出优势，未来的临床运用前景值得期待。.

T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We compare type-1 and type-2 self-organizing fuzzy logic controller (SOFLC) using expert initialized and pretrained extracted rule-bases applied to automatic control of anaesthesia during surgery. We perform experimental simulations using a nonfixed patient model and signal noise to account for environmental and patient drug interaction uncertainties. The simulations evaluate the performance of the SOFLCs in their ability to control anesthetic delivery rates for maintaining desired physiological set points for muscle relaxation and blood pressure during a multistage surgical procedure. The performances of the SOFLCs are evaluated by measuring the steady state errors and control stabilities which indicate the accuracy and precision of control task. Two sets of comparisons based on using expert derived and extracted rule-bases are implemented as Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results indicate that type-2 SOFLCs outperform type-1 SOFLC while handling the various sources of uncertainties. SOFLCs using the extracted rules are also shown to outperform those using expert derived rules in terms of improved control stability.

TI  - Pediatric Chronic Headache and COVID-19: Use of Machine Learning and Biobehavioral Analysis to Classify Headache Mechanism and Optimize Treatment Course.
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Chronic pain experienced by children has the potential to persist into adulthood and drive drugaddiction, mental health problems and suicidal behavior. The level of pain reported by childrenwho experience headache is immense and likely poorly estimated based on lowered ability ofchildren to articulate symptoms, potential malingering or underreporting of pain symptoms, andextensive variability in physical growth and brain development. Headache is a frequently reportedand poorly understood primary and secondary disorder in pediatric subjects. The diversepresentation of headache underscores the potential for distinct mechanisms of headachepresentation, thus placing emphasis on tailored treatment options. There is clear need to betterdefine childhood headache in terms of the clinical presentation and underlying pain physiology.Our hypothesis is that each clinical headache disorder can be defined by unique biobehavioralcharacteristics. In the proposed research program, we (Aim 1) evaluate the clinical and behavioralelements of each headache disorder and pain modulation, (Aim 2) the biobehavioral signature oftreatment refractory headache, and (Aim 3) develop machine learning classifiers to understandthe features that differentiate headache subtype and treatment resistance. This study is likely toyield highly relevant information that will contribute towards identifying and treating headachedisorders in children, identifying unique characteristics of headache and pain processing, and (3)outline biobehavioral targets for different headache disorders. Data from this investigation is likelyto contribute greatly towards the treatment of pediatric pain disorders.

TI  - Implementation of Neural Networks to Frontal Electroencephalography for the Identification of the Transition Responsiveness/Unresponsiveness During Induction of General Anesthesia
T2  - IRBM
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: General anesthesia is a reversible drug-induced state of altered arousal characterized by loss of responsiveness (LOR) due to brainstem inactivation. Precise identification of the LOR during the induction of general anesthesia is extremely important to provide personalized information on anesthetic requirements and could help maintain an adequate level of anesthesia throughout surgery, ensuring safe and effective care and balancing the avoidance of intraoperative awareness and overdose. So, main objective of this paper was to investigate whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) applied to bilateral frontal electroencephalography (EEG) dataset recorded from patients during opioid-propofol anesthetic procedures identified the exact moment of LOR.Material and methods: A clinical protocol was designed to allow for the characterization of different clinical endpoints throughout the transition to unresponsiveness. Fifty (50) patients were enrolled in the study and data from all was included in the final dataset analysis. While under a constant estimated effect-site concentration of 2.5 ng/mL of remifentanil, an 1% propofol infusion was started at 3.3 mL//h until LOR. The level of responsiveness was assessed by an anesthesiologist every six seconds using a modified version of the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (aRASS). The frontal EEG was acquired using a bilateral bispectral (BIS VISTA (TM) v2.0, Medtronic, Ireland) sensor. EEG data was then split into 5-second epochs, and for each epoch, the anesthesiologist's classification was used to label it as responsiveness (no-LOR) or unresponsiveness (LOR). All 5-second epochs were then used as inputs for the CNN model to classify the untrained segment as no-LOR or LOR.Results: The CNN model was able to identify the transition from no-LOR to LOR successfully, achieving 97.90 +/- 0.07% accuracy on the cross-validation set.Conclusion: The obtained results showed that the proposed CNN model was quite efficient in the responsiveness/unresponsiveness classification. We consider our approach constitutes an additional technique to the current methods used in the daily clinical setting where LOR is identified by the loss of response to verbal commands or mechanical stimulus. We therefore hypothesized that automated EEG analysis could be a useful tool to detect the moment of LOR, especially using machine learning approaches. (C) 2021 AGBM.

TI  - Approaching automated applicator digitization from a new angle: Using sagittal images to improve deep learning accuracy and robustness in high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy
T2  - BRACHYTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE: To automate the segmentation of treatment applicators on computed tomography (CT) images for high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy prostate patients implanted with titanium needles with the goals of improving plan quality and reducing the patient's time under anesthesia. METHODS: The investigation was performed using 57 retrospective, interstitial prostate treatments randomly assigned to training (n = 27), validation (n = 10), and testing (n = 20). Unique to this work, the CT image set was reformatted into 2D sagittal slices instead of the default axial orientation. A deep learning-based segmentation was performed using a 2D U-Net architecture followed by a density-based linkage clustering algorithm to classify individual catheters in 3D. Potential confounders, such as gold seeds and conjoined applicators with intersecting needle geometries, were corrected using a customized polynomial fitting algorithm. The geometric agreement of the automated digitization was evaluated against the clinically treated manual digitization to measure tip and shaft errors in the reconstruction. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm achieved tip and shaft agreements of-0.1 +/- 0.6 mm (range-1.8 mm to 1.4 mm) and 0.13 +/- 0.09 mm (maximum 0.96 mm), respectively on a data set with 20 patients and 353 total needles. Our method was able to separate all intersecting applicators reliably. The time to generate the automated applicator digitization averaged approximately 1 min. CONCLUSIONS: Using sagittal instead of axial images for 2D segmentation of interstitial brachytherapy applicators produced submillimeter agreement with manual segmentation. The auto-mated digitization of interstitial applicators in prostate brachytherapy has the potential to improve quality and consistency while reducing the patient's time under anesthesia.

TI  - The Forbidden Sentient Computer: Recent Progress in the Electronic Monitoring of Consciousness
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients have been known to regain consciousness during surgery while still paralyzed by the anesthesia and unable to communicate their distress. Recently, electronic engineers have helped resolve this problem by improving the real-time monitoring of depth of anesthesia. Electronic measurements of the brain's activity are used for many clinical and research purposes. This is possible because the brain uses electrochemical phenomena in order to process data. Many researchers have taken this to mean that advances in computer science will eventually result in sentient computers. Some conflate artificial consciousness with artificial intelligence even though consciousness and intelligence are not positively correlated. Those not trained in neurology, or at least medicine, understandably fail to comprehend what the rich, complex word "consciousness'' actually means as a term of art. Human consciousness can only be evaluated with surrogate markers and is a broad and complex spectrum that ranges from minimally conscious to waking consciousness (what the reader is experiencing right now). The necessary conditions for waking consciousness include a brain in just the right electrical, chemical, and thermal states with sufficient blood pressure. These conditions, in turn, require the brain to have a body that is maintained in the right environment. Hence, waking consciousness is a proper subset of spectrum consciousness and cannot be considered an independent phenomenon capable of being disembodied or sliced off of the spectrum. The Theory of Mind (TOM) from developmental psychology infers that a brain similar to that of humans is a sufficient condition for spectrum consciousness. But this theory is precluded for computers because a child would not recognize a computer as being a living organism that is just like the child. Although TOM could be applied to an ideal android, there is a classic mathematical theorem from systems science that makes such an android seem infeasible.

TI  - Differential classification of states of consciousness using envelope- and phase-based functional connectivity
T2  - NEUROIMAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of sophisticated computational tools to quantify changes in the brain's oscillatory dynamics across states of consciousness have included both envelope- and phase-based measures of functional connectivity (FC), but there are very few direct comparisons of these techniques using the same dataset. The goal of this study was to compare an envelope-based (i.e. Amplitude Envelope Correlation, AEC) and a phase-based (i.e. weighted Phase Lag Index, wPLI) measure of FC in their classification of states of consciousness. Nine healthy participants underwent a three-hour experimental anesthetic protocol with propofol induction and isoflurane maintenance, in which five minutes of 128-channel electroencephalography were recorded before, during, and after anestheticinduced unconsciousness, at the following time points: Baseline; light sedation with propofol (Light Sedation); deep unconsciousness following three hours of surgical levels of anesthesia with isoflurane (Unconscious); five minutes prior to the recovery of consciousness (Pre-ROC); and three hours following the recovery of consciousness (Recovery). Support vector machine classification was applied to the source-localized EEG in the alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency band in order to investigate the ability of AEC and wPLI (separately and together) to discriminate i) the four states from Baseline; ii) Unconscious ("deep" unconsciousness) vs. Pre-ROC ("light" unconsciousness); and iii) responsiveness (Baseline, Light Sedation, Recovery) vs. unresponsiveness (Unconscious, Pre-ROC). AEC and wPLI yielded different patterns of global connectivity across states of consciousness, with AEC showing the strongest network connectivity during the Unconscious epoch, and wPLI showing the strongest connectivity during full consciousness (i.e., Baseline and Recovery). Both measures also demonstrated differential predictive contributions across participants and used different brain regions for classification. AEC showed higher classification accuracy overall, particularly for distinguishing anesthetic-induced unconsciousness from Baseline (83.7 +/- 0.8%). AEC also showed stronger classification accuracy than wPLI when distinguishing Unconscious from Pre-ROC (i.e., "deep" from "light" unconsciousness) (AEC: 66.3 +/- 1.2%; wPLI: 56.2 +/- 1.3%), and when distinguishing between responsiveness and unresponsiveness (AEC: 76.0 +/- 1.3%; wPLI: 63.6 +/- 1.8%). Classification accuracy was not improved compared to AEC when both AEC and wPLI were combined. This analysis of source-localized EEG data demonstrates that envelope- and phase-based FC provide different information about states of consciousness but that, on a group level, AEC is better able to detect relative alterations in brain FC across levels of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness compared to wPLI.

TI  - Hypotension prediction index guided versus conventional goal directed therapy to reduce intraoperative hypotension during thoracic surgery: a randomized trial
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeIntraoperative hypotension is linked to increased incidence of perioperative adverse events such as myocardial and cerebrovascular infarction and acute kidney injury. Hypotension prediction index (HPI) is a novel machine learning guided algorithm which can predict hypotensive events using high fidelity analysis of pulse-wave contour. Goal of this trial is to determine whether use of HPI can reduce the number and duration of hypotensive events in patients undergoing major thoracic procedures.MethodsThirty four patients undergoing esophageal or lung resection were randomized into 2 groups -"machine learning algorithm" (AcumenIQ) and "conventional pulse contour analysis" (Flotrac). Analyzed variables were occurrence, severity and duration of hypotensive events (defined as a period of at least one minute of MAP below 65 mmHg), hemodynamic parameters at 9 different timepoints interesting from a hemodynamics viewpoint and laboratory (serum lactate levels, arterial blood gas) and clinical outcomes (duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stay, occurrence of adverse events and in-hospital and 28-day mortality).ResultsPatients in the AcumenIQ group had significantly lower area below the hypotensive threshold (AUT, 2 vs 16.7 mmHg x minutes) and time-weighted AUT (TWA, 0.01 vs 0.08 mmHg). Also, there were less patients with hypotensive events and cumulative duration of hypotension in the AcumenIQ group. No significant difference between groups was found in terms of laboratory and clinical outcomes.ConclusionsHemodynamic optimization guided by machine learning algorithm leads to a significant decrease in number and duration of hypotensive events compared to traditional goal directed therapy using pulse-contour analysis hemodynamic monitoring in patients undergoing major thoracic procedures. Further, larger studies are needed to determine true clinical utility of HPI guided hemodynamic monitoring.

TI  - Difficult intubation assessment using statistical factor analysis decision tree
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Correct and rapid tracheal intubation is an essential anesthesia task for surgical operations. Intubation highly depends on the subjective judgment and experience of the anesthetist. This paper proposes a statistical factor analysis approach to model the preferences of expert anesthetists to enable more accurate pre-operation judgments in cases of difficult intubation. Factor analysis combined with the mutual information between factors is used to generate a robust decision tree (DT) using Bartlett's node splitting criterion for better decision-making. A tablet computer application is also developed to assist judgment. Several experiments were performed to investigate judgment accuracy and learning effects. Our proposed approach outperformed both a well-known C5.0 DT and an expert opinion derived DT. Encouraging results concerning robustness and efficiency were observed for our approach.

TI  - Clin-STAR corner: 2021 update in musculoskeletal pain in older adults with a focus on osteoarthritis-related pain
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain remains a leading cause of disability and functional impairment among older adults and is associated with substantial societal and personal costs. Chronic pain is particularly challenging to manage in older adults because of multimorbidity, concerns about treatment-related harm, as well as older adults' beliefs about pain and its management. This narrative review presents data on nine high-quality, peer-reviewed clinical trials published primarily over the past two years that focus on MSK pain management in older adults, of which four were comprehensively reviewed. These studies address contributors to knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain (insomnia), provide evidence for digital delivery or artificial intelligence driven behavioral interventions and potentially more efficient/equally effective modes of delivering glucocorticoids for OA; each of the selected studies have potential for scalability and meaningful impact in the care of older adults.

M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
AB  - Objective To develop a risk prediction model combining pre/intraoperative risk factors and intraoperative vital signs for postoperative healthcare-associated infection(HAI)based on deep learning. Methods We carried out a retrospective study based on two randomized controlled trials(NCT02715076,ChiCTR-IPR-17011099).The patients who underwent elective radical resection of advanced digestive system tumor were included in this study.The primary outcome was HAI within 30 days after surgery.Logistic regression analysis and long short-term memory(LSTM)model based on iteratively occluding sections of the input were used for feature selection.The risk prediction model for postoperative HAI was developed based on deep learning,combining the selected pre/intraoperative risk factors and intraoperative vital signs,and was evaluated by comparison with other models.Finally,we adopted the simulated annealing algorithm to simulatively adjust the vital signs during surgery,trying to explore the adjustment system that can reduce the risk of HAI. Results A total of 839 patients were included in this study,of which 112(13.3%)developed HAI within 30 days after surgery.The selected pre/intraoperative risk factors included neoadjuvant chemotherapy,parenteral nutrition,esophagectomy,gastrectomy,colorectal resection,pancreatoduodenectomy,hepatic resection,intraoperative blood loss>500 ml,and anesthesia time>4 h.The intraoperative vital signs significantly associated with HAI were in an order of heart rate>core body temperature>systolic blood pressure>diastolic blood pressure.Compared with multivariable Logistic regression model,random forest model,and LSTM model including vital signs only,this deep learning-based prediction model performed best(ACC=0.733,F1=0.237,AUC=0.728).The simulation via simulated annealing algorithm reduced the incidence of postoperative HAI.Moreover,the incidence decreased most in the case of reducing the initial annealing temperature and choosing the last 20% of surgery procedure. Conclusions This study developed a risk prediction model for postoperative HAI based on deep learning,which combined pre/intraoperative risk factors and intraoperative basic vital signs.Using simulated annealing algorithm to adjust intraoperative vital signs could reduce the incidence of postoperative HAI to some extent.

TI  - Towards a fully automated surveillance of well-being status in laboratory mice using deep learning: Starting with facial expression analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the well-being of an animal is hindered by the limitations of efficient communication between humans and animals. Instead of direct communication, a variety of parameters are employed to evaluate the well-being of an animal. Especially in the field of biomedical research, scientifically sound tools to assess pain, suffering, and distress for experimental animals are highly demanded due to ethical and legal reasons. For mice, the most commonly used laboratory animals, a valuable tool is the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS), a coding system for facial expressions of pain in mice. We aim to develop a fully automated system for the surveillance of post-surgical and post-anesthetic effects in mice. Our work introduces a semi-automated pipeline as a first step towards this goal. A new data set of images of black-furred laboratory mice that were moving freely is used and provided. Images were obtained after anesthesia (with isoflurane or ketamine/xylazine combination) and surgery (castration). We deploy two pre-trained state of the art deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (ResNet50 and InceptionV3) and compare to a third CNN architecture without pre-training. Depending on the particular treatment, we achieve an accuracy of up to 99% for the recognition of the absence or presence of post-surgical and/or post-anesthetic effects on the facial expression.

TI  - Synthesizing Intraoperative Multivariate Time Series with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project Summary/AbstractPatient safety is paramount in anesthesia. Intraoperative complications and hemodynamic instability areassociated with reduced long-term survival and can lead to risks such as myocardial injury, stroke, kidneyinjury, and even death. Therefore, predicting and preventing intraoperative hemodynamic instability is veryimportant in the decision-making process of anesthesia providers. An ideal pre-operative assessment systemwould predict, from patient information, all intraoperative complications and physiological changes before asurgical procedure begins. Predicting intraoperative hemodynamic instability during surgery requires analyzingan enormous amount of physiological data and spotting patterns in that data before adverse events occur.However, doing this requires a large volume of high-resolution intraoperative data taken directly from thephysiological monitors in the operating room to train machine learning models, and these data currently areunavailable. Therefore, the research goal of this proposed training program is to generate a continuousmultivariate intraoperative physiological time series that display the effects of anesthesia management usingstate-of-the-art mathematic tools. The generated data can provide unlimited and realistic intraoperative data toidentify intraoperative complications and later build a real-time intraoperative clinical decision support system.The proposed training program has two aims. Aim 1 will enable the applicant to create a data-driven objectiveapproach for intraoperative complication prediction and risk assessment. Key information from anesthesia pre-op assessment will be used to generate synthetic low-resolution intraoperative physiological data. This datawill inform anesthesia providers of the type, timing, and range of a given patient’s intraoperative hemodynamicinstability and complications before surgery. Aim 2 will enable the applicant to build a virtual database that willprovide unlimited high-resolution intraoperative data to train machine learning algorithms for a future real-timeintraoperative clinical decision support system. The recorded low-resolution intraoperative data and the keyinformation from anesthesia pre-op assessment will be inputted into the second tool to upscale existing minute-resolution intraoperative data to second-resolution level for data augmentation to boost the number of availablesurgical cases. This K08 research program will enable the applicant to fill key knowledge gaps in applying datascience in the existing low-resolution intraoperative data in medical records and non-recorded high-resolutionintraoperative data displayed by anesthesia devices. The results will orient anesthesia providers andresearchers in the design and implementation of data-driven perioperative prediction systems over traditionalanesthesia risk assessment. Ultimately, this K08 award will provide the applicant with the senior mentorship,skills, research experience and data resources to become an independent nurse investigator after training.

TI  - Addition of dexamethasone to prolong peripheral nerve blocks: a ChatGPT-created narrative review
T2  - REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence chatbot, produces detailed responses and human-like coherent answers, and has been used in the clinical and academic medicine. To evaluate its accuracy in regional anesthesia topics, we produced a ChatGPT review on the addition of dexamethasone to prolong peripheral nerve blocks. A group of experts in regional anesthesia and pain medicine were invited to help shape the topic to be studied, refine the questions entered in to the ChatGPT program, vet the manuscript for accuracy, and create a commentary on the article. Although ChatGPT produced an adequate summary of the topic for a general medical or lay audience, the review that were created appeared to be inadequate for a subspecialty audience as the expert authors. Major concerns raised by the authors included the poor search methodology, poor organization/lack of flow, inaccuracies/omissions of text or references, and lack of novelty. At this time, we do not believe ChatGPT is able to replace human experts and is extremely limited in providing original, creative solutions/ideas and interpreting data for a subspecialty medical review article.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Attenuation Correction of PET/MRI in Pediatric Brain Tumor Patients: Evaluation in a Clinical Setting
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a useful tool for assisting in correct differentiation of tumor progression from reactive changes. O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET)-PET in combination with MRI can add valuable information for clinical decision making. Acquiring FET-PET/MRI simultaneously allows for a one-stop-shop that limits the need for a second sedation or anesthesia as with PET and MRI in sequence. PET/MRI is challenged by lack of a direct measure of photon attenuation. Accepted solutions for attenuation correction (AC) might not be applicable to pediatrics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of the subject-specific MR-derived AC method RESOLUTE, modified to a pediatric cohort, against the performance of an MR-AC technique based on deep learning in a pediatric brain tumor cohort.Methods: The modifications to RESOLUTE and the implementation of a deep learning method were performed using 79 pediatric patient examinations. We analyzed the 36 of these with active brain tumor area above 1 mL. We measured background (B), tumor mean and maximal activity (T-MEAN, T-M(AX)), biological tumor volume (BTV), and calculated the clinical metrics T-MEAN/B and T-MAX/B.Results: Overall, we found both RESOLUTE and our DeepUTE methodologies to accurately reproduce the CT-AC clinical metrics. Regardless of age, both methods were able to obtain AC maps similar to the CT-AC, albeit with DeepUTE producing the most similar based on both quantitative metrics and visual inspection. In the patient-by-patient analysis DeepUTE was the only technique with all patients inside the predefined acceptable clinical limits. It also had a higher precision with relative %-difference to the reference CT-AC (T-MAX/B mean: -0.1%, CI: [-0.8%, 0.5%], p = 0.54) compared to RESOLUTE (T-MAX/B mean: 0.3%, CI: [-0.6%, 1.2%], p = 0.67) and DIXON-AC (T-MAX/B mean: 5.9%, CI: [4.5%, 7.4%], p < 0.0001).Conclusion: Overall, we found DeepUTE to be the AC method that most robustly reproduced the CT-AC clinical metrics per se, closely followed by RESOLUTE modified to pediatric cohorts. The added accuracy due to better noise handling of DeepUTE, ease of use, as well as the improved runtime makes DeepUTE the method of choice for PET/MRI attenuation correction.

TI  - Weakly supervised real-time instance segmentation for ultrasound images of median nerves
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Medical ultrasound technology has garnered significant attention in recent years, with Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) and carpal tunnel diagnosis (CTS) being two notable examples. Instance segmentation, based on deep learning approaches, is a promising choice to support the analysis of ultrasound data. However, many instance segmentation models cannot achieve the requirement of ultrasound technology e.g. real-time. Moreover, fully supervised instance segmentation models require large numbers of images and corresponding mask annotations for training, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive in the case of medical ultrasound data. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised framework, CoarseInst, to achieve real-time instance segmentation of ultrasound images with only box annotations. CoarseInst not only improves the network structure, but also proposes a two-stage "coarse-to-fine"training strategy. Specifically, median nerves are used as the target application for UGRA and CTS. CoarseInst consists of two stages, with pseudo mask labels generated in the coarse mask generation stage for self-training. An object enhancement block is incorporated to mitigate the performance loss caused by parameter reduction in this stage. Additionally, we introduce a pair of loss functions, the amplification loss, and the deflation loss, that work together to generate the masks. A center area mask searching algorithm is also proposed to generate labels for the deflation loss. In the self-training stage, a novel self-feature similarity loss is designed to generate more precise masks. Experimental results on a practical ultrasound dataset demonstrate that CoarseInst could achieve better performance than some state-of-the-art fully supervised works.

TI  - More Than Meets the Eye: Analyzing Anesthesiologists' Visual Attention in the Operating Room Using Deep Learning Models
T2  - PREDICTIVE INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE, PRIME 2023
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th International Workshop on Predictive Intelligence in Medicine (PRIME)
CL  - Vancouver, CANADA
AB  - Patient's vital signs, which are displayed on monitors, make the anesthesiologist's visual attention (VA) a key component in the safe management of patients under general anesthesia; moreover, the distribution of said VA and the ability to acquire specific cues throughout the anesthetic, may have a direct impact on patient's outcome. Currently, most studies employ wearable eye-tracking technologies to analyze anesthesiologists' visual patterns. Albeit being able to produce meticulous data, wearable devices are not a sustainable solution for large-scale or long-term use for data collection in the operating room (OR). Thus, by utilizing a novel eye-tracking method in the form of deep learning models that process monitor-mounted webcams, we collected continuous behavioral data and gained insight into the anesthesiologist's VA distribution with minimal disturbance to their natural workflow. In this study, we collected OR video recordings using the proposed framework and compared different visual behavioral patterns. We distinguished between baseline VA distribution during uneventful periods to patterns associated with active phases or during critical, unanticipated incidents. In the future, such a platform may serve as a crucial component of context-aware assistive technologies in the OR.

AB  - Anesthesiology is a subject with strong practicality and application. Undergraduate anesthesiology teaching needs to strike a balance between theoretical knowledge, clinical skill training, and clinical thinking development. Clinical probation and practice are an important part of undergraduate anesthesia teaching. Traditional clinical teaching uses real patients for demonstration and training, but as patients become more self-protective and less cooperative, there are not enough patients for clinical skill training. Simulation is to teach medical scenes in real life under the control of standardized technical guidelines and parameters. Since then, with the rapid development of computer technology, simulation technology and simulation teaching have been greatly developed and are more and more used in clinical teaching, skill evaluation, and scientific research. This study explores the effective methods of clinical teaching in anesthesiology by comparing the effectiveness of traditional teaching methods and simulation teaching methods in undergraduate clinical teaching. It is difficult to combine theory and practice in first aid, which does not allow them to directly receive and deal with emergency medical treatment and resuscitation. In China's current medical environment and patients' high demand for medical services, it is imperative to vigorously carry out simulated medical education. In the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, according to the advantages of teaching hospitals, our hospital took the lead in carrying out the simulation education project, which is still in the exploratory stage and not systematic enough. This study will help us to better carry out simulation teaching and improve the clinical skills of medical students in the future. Methods. The student group and class took the advanced simulator training as the experimental group, applied the advanced integrated simulator and other systems of the Norwegian company, referred to the international guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and cardiovascular first aid in 2005, and practiced in the emergency department during the clinical internship and "emergency clinical simulation training" course. The course includes basic life support, advanced life support, and comprehensive training of CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and endotracheal intubation. Results. The passing rate of simulated first aid practice was 94.4%; 100% of the students think it is necessary to set up the course, 91% of the students think it is practical, 91% of the students think the course content is reasonable and perfect, and 77%-100% of the students think the course has improved their first aid operation ability, comprehensive application of knowledge, and clinical thinking ability. Conclusion. Carrying out the course of "clinical simulated first aid training" through the advanced simulator system can effectively improve the interns' clinical first aid operation ability, teamwork ability, and self-confidence, improve the students' clinical thinking and judgment ability, and improve the service level to patients.

TI  - Examining Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities in the Treatment of Pain and Injury Emergencies.
T2  - HCA healthcare journal of medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Racial, ethnic, and gender disparities in effective pain management have been well-documented across healthcare settings. However, discrepancies in the treatment of patients in prehospital pain management settings have not been well researched. The objective of this study was to determine whether Wyoming emergency medical service (EMS) providers' use of opioids to treat prehospital pain or injury varies by patient race/ethnicity or gender.Methods: This cross-sectional study of EMS records examined 27 448 patient care reports (PCRs) generated during emergency medical responses to pain/injury emergencies in the state of Wyoming between January 2016 and March 2019. We included PCRs in the sample when 1) the primary impression was pain or injury, 2) the type of service was a 911 response, 3) the patient received treatment from and was transported by the EMS unit completing the PCR, and 4) the responding unit included one or more providers authorized to administer opioids.Results: The analysis identified a disparity in opioid administration by EMS providers during emergency transport (N = 27 448). Logistic regression reveals that EMS providers administered opioids to American Indian/Alaska Native patients (AI/AN) [n = 1610; 5.9%; P < .001; OR = 0.44] and those of Hispanic ethnicity (n = 1351; 4.9%; P = .001; OR = 0.74) at statistically significant lower rates (n = 14 769; 53.8%; P = .004; OR = 0.90) than they administer opioids to White patients. The analysis found EMS providers administer opioids to females at significantly lower rates (P = .004) compared to males.Conclusion: Wyoming EMS providers administer opioids to White and male patients more often than non-White and female patients. Our results do not show a significant difference in the administration of opioids between White and Black patients. However, the data indicate a statistically significant difference between Hispanic, AI/AN, and White patients as well as between male and female patients.

TI  - Understanding People With Chronic Pain Who Use a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Artificial Intelligence Mental Health App (Wysa): Mixed Methods Retrospective Observational Study
T2  - JMIR HUMAN FACTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Digital health interventions can bridge barriers in access to treatment among individuals with chronic pain.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the perceived needs, engagement, and effectiveness of the mental health app Wysa with regard to mental health outcomes among real-world users who reported chronic pain and engaged with the app for support.Methods: Real-world data from users (N=2194) who reported chronic pain and associated health conditions in their conversations with the mental health app were examined using a mixed methods retrospective observational study. An inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the conversational data of users with chronic pain to assess perceived needs, along with comparative macro-analyses of conversational flows to capture engagement within the app. Additionally, the scores from a subset of users who completed a set of pre-post assessment questionnaires, namely Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (n=69) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) (n=57), were examined to evaluate the effectiveness of Wysa in providing support for mental health concerns among those managing chronic pain.Results: The themes emerging from the conversations of users with chronic pain included health concerns, socioeconomic concerns, and pain management concerns. Findings from the quantitative analysis indicated that users with chronic pain showed significantly greater app engagement (P<.001) than users without chronic pain, with a large effect size (Vargha and Delaney A=0.76-0.80). Furthermore, users with pre-post assessments during the study period were found to have significant improvements in group means for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 symptom scores, with a medium effect size (Cohen d=0.60-0.61).Conclusions: The findings indicate that users look for tools that can help them address their concerns related to mental health, pain management, and sleep issues. The study findings also indicate the breadth of the needs of users with chronic pain and the lack of support structures, and suggest that Wysa can provide effective support to bridge the gap.

AB  - The progress of critical care medicine in 2021 is still encouraging. The new international guideline for management of sepsis and septic shock came out after 4 years. Besides, a couple of preferable clinical evidences were released including restrictive blood transfusion strategy for patients with acute myocardial infarction, prevention of peripheral venous catheter infection, heparin inhalation and driving pressure setting in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lower oxygenation target for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, low level positive end-expiratory pressure in non-ARDS patients with respiratory failure, light sedation or non-sedation strategy, biological phenotypes, as well machine learning in sepsis and ARDS. However, we also encounter negative results such as balanced solution during fluid resuscitation, hypothermia therapy after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or traumatic brain injury, adrenomedullin-specific antibody adrecizumab therapy and coupled plasma filtration-adsorption (CPFA) therapy for patients with septic shock, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) implementation in acute hypoxic respiratory failure, continuous infusion of hypertonic saline in patients with traumatic brain injury. Collectively, in the future, individualized diagnosis and management based on the principle of "wise choice" will become the daily practice scene for all intensivists.

TI  - Predicting optimal endotracheal tube size and depth in pediatric patients using demographic data and machine learning techniques
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Use of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) with appropriate size and depth can help minimize intubation-related complications in pediatric patients. Existing age-based formulae for selecting the optimal ETT size present several inaccuracies. We developed a machine learning model that predicts the optimal size and depth of ETTs in pediatric patients using demographic data, enabling clinical applications.Methods: Data from 37,057 patients younger than 12 years who underwent general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were retrospectively analyzed. Gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) model was developed and compared with traditional age-based formulae.Results: The GBRT model demonstrated the highest macro-averaged F1 scores of 0.502 (95% CI [0.486, 0.568]) and 0.669 (95% CI [0.640, 0.694]) for predicting the uncuffed and cuffed ETT size (internal diameter), outperforming the age-based formulae that yielded 0.163 (95% CI [0.140, 0.196], P < 0.001) and 0.392 (95% CI [0.378, 0.406], P < 0.001), respectively. In predicting the ETT depth (distance from tip to lip corner), the GBRT model showed the lowest mean absolute error of 0.71 cm (95% CI [0.69, 0.72]) and 0.72 cm (95% CI [0.70, 0.74]) compared to the age-based formulae that showed an error of 1.18 cm (95% CI [1.16, 1.20], P < 0.001) and 1.34 cm (95% CI [1.31, 1.38], P < 0.001) for uncuffed and cuffed ETT, respectively.Conclusions: The GBRT model using only demographic data accurately predicted the ETT size and depth. If these results are validated, the model may be practical for predicting optimal ETT size and depth for pediatric patients.

AB  - Chronic pain is recognised as a complex and challenging condition. In Scotland alone, over 800,000 people are affected by chronic pain to varying degrees [1]. The experience of living with, and delivering treatment and care for chronic pain therefore requires a management strategy that responds effectively within a complex context. Management strategies should be interdisciplinary and take into account the many stakeholders involved, including the person experiencing chronic pain. This paper outlines the role for visualisation and machine learning to support people to make sense of data and enable the translation of the complexity around chronic pain towards better management, and in particular self-management.

TI  - Prediction of inpatient pressure ulcers based on routine healthcare data using machine learning methodology
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the relevance of pressure ulcers (PU) in inpatient care, the predictive power and role of care-related risk factors (e.g. anesthesia) remain unclear. We investigated the predictability of PU incidence and its association with multiple care variables. We included all somatic cases between 2014 and 2018 with length of stay >= 2d in a German university hospital. For regression analyses and prediction we used Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) as nonparametric modeling approach. To assess predictive accuracy, we compared BART, random forest, logistic regression (LR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) using area under the curve (AUC), confusion matrices and multiple indicators of predictive performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, F1, positive/ negative predictive value) in the full dataset and subgroups. Analysing 149,006 cases revealed high predictive variable importance and associations between incident PU and ventilation, age, anesthesia (>= 1 h) and number of care-involved wards. Despite high AUCs (range 0.89-0.90), many false negative predictions led to low sensitivity (range 0.04-0.10). Ventilation, age, anesthesia and number of care-involved wards were associated with incident PU. Using anesthesia as a proxy for immobility, an hourly repositioning is indicated. The low sensitivity indicates major challenges for correctly predicting PU based on routine data.

TI  - Machine learning suggests sleep as a core factor in chronic pain
T2  - PAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with chronic pain have complex pain profiles and associated problems. Subgroup analysis can help identify key problems. We used a data-based approach to define pain phenotypes and their most relevant associated problems in 320 patients undergoing tertiary pain management. Unsupervised machine learning analysis of parameters "pain intensity," "number of pain areas," "pain duration," "activity pain interference," and "affective pain interference," implemented as emergent self-organizing maps, identified 3 patient phenotype clusters. Supervised analyses, implemented as different types of decision rules, identified "affective pain interference" and the "number of pain areas" as most relevant for cluster assignment. These appeared 698 and 637 times, respectively, in 1000 cross-validation runs among the most relevant characteristics in an item categorization approach in a computed ABC analysis. Cluster assignment was achieved with a median balanced accuracy of 79.9%, a sensitivity of 74.1%, and a specificity of 87.7%. In addition, among 59 demographic, pain etiology, comorbidity, lifestyle, psychological, and treatment-related variables, sleep problems appeared 638 and 439 times among the most important characteristics in 1000 cross-validation runs where patients were assigned to the 2 extreme pain phenotype clusters. Also important were the parameters "fear of pain," "self-rated poor health," and "systolic blood pressure." Decision trees trained with this information assigned patients to the extreme pain phenotype with an accuracy of 67%. Machine learning suggested sleep problems as key factors in the most difficult pain presentations, therefore deserving priority in the treatment of chronic pain.

TI  - Determining Carina and Clavicular Distance-Dependent Positioning of Endotracheal Tube in Critically Ill Patients: An Artificial Intelligence-Based Approach
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is employed for maintaining the airway patency of in critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation. Generally, ETI is conducted under anesthesia in the intensive care unit, during which the endotracheal tube (ETT) is inserted at a particular depth into the trachea, and a malpositioned ETT may result in hazardous consequences, such as a collapsed or hyperinflated lung. Therefore, we proposed a deep learning-based CNN approach, combined with four key point annotations on chest radiographs (tracheal tube end, carina, and left/right clavicular heads), which demonstrated significant sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for recognizing and localizing the ETT tip on chest radiographs. These findings may assist in radiographic confirmation of precise ETT placement and help in ruling out other etiologies of respiratory failure. Early and accurate prediction of endotracheal tube (ETT) location is pivotal for critically ill patients. Automatic and timely detection of faulty ETT locations from chest X-ray images may avert patients' morbidity and mortality. Therefore, we designed convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithms to evaluate ETT position appropriateness relative to four detected key points, including tracheal tube end, carina, and left/right clavicular heads on chest radiographs. We estimated distances from the tube end to tracheal carina and the midpoint of clavicular heads. A DenseNet121 encoder transformed images into embedding features, and a CNN-based decoder generated the probability distributions. Based on four sets of tube-to-carina distance-dependent parameters (i.e., (i) 30-70 mm, (ii) 30-60 mm, (iii) 20-60 mm, and (iv) 20-55 mm), corresponding models were generated, and their accuracy was evaluated through the predicted L1 distance to ground-truth coordinates. Based on tube-to-carina and tube-to-clavicle distances, the highest sensitivity, and specificity of 92.85% and 84.62% respectively, were revealed for 20-55 mm. This implies that tube-to-carina distance between 20 and 55 mm is optimal for an AI-based key point appropriateness detection system and is empirically comparable to physicians' consensus.

TI  - Difficult Spinal-Arachnoid Puncture (DSP) Score: Development and Performance Analysis
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Difficult and traumatic neuraxial blocks and procedures are not uncommon. Although score -based prediction has been attempted, the practical application of those has remained limited for various reasons. The aim of this study was to develop a clinical scoring system from the strong predictors of failed spinal-arachnoid puncture procedures assessed previously using artificial neural network (ANN) analysis and analyze the score's performance on the index cohort.Methods: The present study is based on the ANN model analyzing 300 spinal-arachnoid punctures (index cohort) performed in an academic institute in India. For the development of the score, i.e., Difficult Spinal-Arachnoid Puncture (DSP) Score, the coefficient estimates of the input variables, which showed a Pr(>|z|) value of <0.01, were considered. The resultant DSP Score was then applied to the index cohort for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, Youden's J point determination for best sensitivity and specificity, and diagnostic statistical analysis for the cut-off value for predicting the difficulty.Results: A DSP Score incorporating spine grades, performers' experience, and positioning difficulty was developed; the minimum and maximum scores were 0 and 7, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the DSP Score was 0.858 (95% confidence interval 0.811-0.905), Youden's J point for cut-off was at 2, which showed a specificity and sensitivity of 98.15% and 56.5%, respectively. Conclusion: The ANN model-based DSP Score developed for predicting the difficult spinal-arachnoid puncture procedure showed an excellent area under the ROC curve. At the cut-off value 2, the score had a sensitivity plus specificity of approximately 155%, indicating that the tool can be useful as a diagnostic (predictive) tool in clinical practice.

TI  - Assessment of agreement among diplomates of the American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia for scoring the recovery of horses from anesthesia by use of subjective grading scales and development of a system for evaluation of the recovery of horses from anesthesia by use of accelerometry
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE To evaluate agreement among diplomates of the American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia for scores determined by use of a simple descriptive scale (SDS) or a composite grading scale (CGS) for quality of recovery of horses from anesthesia and to investigate use of 3-axis accelerometry (3AA) for objective evaluation of recovery.ANIMALS 12 healthy adult horses.PROCEDURES Horses were fitted with a 3AA device and then were anesthetized. Eight diplomates evaluated recovery by use of an SDS, and 7 other diplomates evaluated recovery by use of a CGS. Agreement was tested with. and AI statistics for the SDS and an ANOVA for the CGS. A library of mathematical models was used to map 3AA data against CGS scores.RESULTS Agreement among diplomates using the SDS was slight (k = 0.19; ACI = 0.22). The CGS scores differed significantly among diplomates. Best fit of 3AA data against CGS scores yielded the following equation: RS = 9.998 X SG(0.633) X Sigma UG(0.174), where RS is a horse's recovery score determined with 3AA, SG is acceleration of the successful attempt to stand, and Sigma UG is the sum of accelerations of unsuccessful attempts to stand.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Subjective scoring of recovery of horses from anesthesia resulted in poor agreement among diplomates. Subjective scoring may lead to differences in conclusions about recovery quality; thus, there is a need for an objective scoring method. The 3AA system removed subjective bias in evaluations of recovery of horses and warrants further study.

While obtaining accurate, medical domain interpretable results is crucial, it is demanding because real-world EHRs contain many inconsistencies and inaccuracies. Further, testing of such machine learning-based systems in clinical practice has received limited attention and are yet to be accepted by clinicians for regular use. Methods We present our results from the evaluation of an NLP-driven CDSS developed and implemented in a Norwegian Hospital. The system incorporates unsupervised and supervised machine learning combined with rule-based algorithms for clinical concept-based searching to identify and classify allergies of concern for anesthesia and intensive care. The system also implements a semi-supervised machine learning approach to automatically annotate medical concepts in the narrative. Results Evaluation of system adoption was performed by a mixed methods approach applying The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a theoretical lens. Most of the respondents demonstrated a high degree of system acceptance and expressed a positive attitude towards the system in general and intention to use the system in the future. Increased detection of patient allergies, and thus improved quality of practice and patient safety during surgery or ICU stays, was perceived as the most important advantage of the system. Conclusions Our combined machine learning and rule-based approach benefits system performance, efficiency, and interpretability. The results demonstrate that the proposed CDSS increases detection of patient allergies, and that the system received high-level acceptance by the clinicians using it. Useful recommendations for further system improvements and implementation initiatives are reducing the quantity of alarms, expansion of the system to include more clinical concepts, closer EHR system integration, and more workstations available at point of care.

TI  - Detecting drug diversion in health-system data using machine learning and advanced analytics
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The theft of drugs from healthcare facilities, also known as drug diversion, occurs frequently but is often undetected. This paper describes a research study to develop and test novel drug diversion detection methods. Improved diversion detection and reduction in diversion improves patient safety, limits harm to the person diverting, reduces the public health impact of substance use disorder, and mitigates significant liability risk to pharmacists and their organizations. Methods Ten acute care inpatient hospitals across 4 independent health systems extracted 2 datasets from various health information technology systems. Both datasets were consolidated, normalized, classified, and sampled to provide a harmonious dataset for analysis. Supervised machine learning methods were iteratively used on the initial sample dataset to train algorithms to classify medication movement transactions as involving a low or high risk of diversion. Thereafter, the resulting machine learning model classified the risk of diversion in a historical dataset capturing 8 to 24 months of history that included 27.9 million medication movement transactions by 19,037 nursing, 1,047 pharmacy, and 712 anesthesia clinicians and that included 22 known, blinded diversion cases to measure when the model would have detected the diversion compared to when the diversion was actually detected by existing methods. Results The machine learning model had 96.3% accuracy, 95.9% specificity, and 96.6% sensitivity in detecting transactions involving a high risk of diversion using the initial sample dataset. In subsequent testing using the much larger historical dataset, the analytics detected known diversion cases (n = 22) in blinded data faster than existing detection methods (a mean of 160 days and a median of 74 days faster; range, 7-579 days faster). Conclusion The study showed that (1) consolidated datasets and (2) supervised machine learning can detect known diversion cases faster than existing detection methods. Users of the technology also noted improved investigation efficiency.

CL  - Cartagena, COLOMBIA
AB  - Magnetically controlled capsule endoscope (MCCE) is an emerging tool for the diagnosis of gastric diseases with the advantages of comfort, safety, and no anesthesia. In this paper, we develop algorithms to detect and measure human gastric peristalsis (contraction wave) using video sequences acquired by MCCE. We develop a spatial-temporal deep learning algorithm to detect gastric contraction waves and measure human gastric peristalsis periods. The quality of MCCE video sequences is prone to camera motion. We design a camera motion detector (CMD) to process the MCCE video sequences, mitigating the camera movement during MCCE examination. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose computer vision-based solutions to both detect and measure periods of human gastric peristalsis. Our methods have great potential in assisting the diagnosis of gastric diseases by evaluating gastric motility.

TI  - Propofol Anesthesia Depth Monitoring Based on Self-Attention and Residual Structure Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objective. To study the new method of selecting CNN+EEG index values, based on self-attention and residual structure of convolutional neural network, to deeply monitor propofol anesthesia. Methods. We compare nine index values, select CNN+EEG, which has good correlation with BIS index, as an anesthesia state observation index to identify the parameters of the model, and establish a model based on self-attention and dual resistructure convolutional neural network. The data of 93 groups of patients were selected and randomly grouped into three parts: training set, validation set, and test set, and compared the best and worst results predicted by BIS. Result. The best result is that the model's accuracy of predicting BLS on the test set has an overall upward trend, eventually reaching more than 90%. The overall error shows a gradual decrease and eventually approaches zero. The worst result is that the model's accuracy of predicting BIS on the test set has an overall upward trend. The accuracy rate is relatively stable without major fluctuations, but the final accuracy rate is above 70%. Conclusion. The prediction of BIS indicators by the deep learning method CNN algorithm shows good results in statistics.

TI  - TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - AbstractAdverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, andrepresent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated,collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computationalsupport. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: NavigatingInformation, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate thedynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices.The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called theAnesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronichealth record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, andremote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring forthe OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICStrial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototypetelemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician userfeedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperativeoutcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT.The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implementand sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machinelearning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high riskfor experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’(anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior.This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in theOR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct arigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, andclinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratoryfailure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of atelemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology inroutine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoingsurgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality ofperioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain.

TI  - Automated machine learning-based model for the prediction of delirium in patients after surgery for degenerative spinal disease
T2  - CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This study used machine learning algorithms to identify critical variables and predict postoperative delirium (POD) in patients with degenerative spinal disease. Methods We included 663 patients who underwent surgery for degenerative spinal disease and received general anesthesia. The LASSO method was used to screen essential features associated with POD. Clinical characteristics, preoperative laboratory parameters, and intraoperative variables were reviewed and were used to construct nine machine learning models including a training set and validation set (80% of participants), and were then evaluated in the rest of the study sample (20% of participants). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Brier scores were used to compare the prediction performances of different models. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithms (XGBOOST) model was used to predict POD. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) package was used to interpret the XGBOOST model. Data of 49 patients were prospectively collected for model validation. Results The XGBOOST model outperformed the other classifier models in the training set (area under the curve [AUC]: 92.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.7%-95.0%), validation set (AUC: 87.0%, 95% CI: 80.7%-93.3%). This model also achieved the lowest Brier Score. Twelve vital variables, including age, serum albumin, the admission-to-surgery time interval, C-reactive protein level, hypertension, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative minimum blood pressure, cardiovascular-cerebrovascular disease, smoking, alcohol consumption, pulmonary disease, and admission-intraoperative maximum blood pressure difference, were selected. The XGBOOST model performed well in the prospective cohort (accuracy: 85.71%). Conclusion A machine learning model and a web predictor for delirium after surgery for the degenerative spinal disease were successfully developed to demonstrate the extent of POD risk during the perioperative period, which could guide appropriate preventive measures for high-risk patients.

TI  - The Benefits of Integrative Medicine for Pain Management in Oncology: A Narrative Review of the Current Evidence
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of this evidence-based study is to narrate and evaluate the current evidence on recommendations for practicing physicians and other healthcare providers regarding integrative approaches to managing pain in patients with cancer. This review will assess the guideline recommendations and analyze the role of integrative medicine in addressing cancer pain in patients. The literature search highlights relevant studies that will inform evidence-based recommendations for practicing physicians, highlighting their relevance and weaknesses. Acupuncture, massage, and hypnosis have intermediate-strength evidence quality and are moderately recommended for various types of cancer pain. Most of the evidence points to acupuncture being recommended for aromatase inhibitor-related joint pain, hypnosis for procedural pain, and massage for palliative care pain. Other practices with lower-quality evidence include yoga and guided imagery with progressive muscle relaxation, mostly recommended for general cancer pain or musculoskeletal pain. Additionally, music therapy is recommended for procedural or surgical pain. Low-quality or inconclusive evidence was found for other mind-body interventions or natural products. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to provide recommendations for pediatric patients. Further research is required to enhance our understanding of the role of integrative medicine interventions in caring for cancer patients.

TI  - Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organsystems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatricpatients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higherthan that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principleof this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performanceis fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physicianobservers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ twoapproaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advancedimage reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradationwill be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstructiondenoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degradediagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss ofimage quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia tominimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeleddimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to therenal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns andtoddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post-infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSAwill be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstructionand motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients throughimproved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3.Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation andcorrection; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reductionenabled by DL denoising and motion correction.

TI  - Prediction of blood pressure variability during thrombectomy using supervised machine learning and outcomes of patients with ischemic stroke from large vessel occlusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF THROMBOSIS AND THROMBOLYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is the standard of care for patients with acute ischemic stroke from large vessel occlusion (AIS-LVO). The association of blood pressure variability (BPV) during MT and outcomes are unknown. We leveraged a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict patient characteristics that are associated with BPV indices. We performed a retrospective review of our comprehensive stroke center's registry of all adult patients undergoing MT between 01/01/2016 and 12/31/2019. The primary outcome was poor functional independence, defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) >= 3. We used probit analysis and multivariate logistic regressions to evaluate the association of patients' clinical factors and outcomes. We applied a machine learning algorithm (random forest, RF) to determine predictive factors for the different BPV indices during MT. Evaluation was performed with root-mean-square error ( RMSE) and normalized-RMSE (nRMSE) metrics. We analyzed 375 patients with mean age (+/- standard deviation [SD]) of 65 (15) years. There were 234 ( 62%) patients with mRS >= 3. Univariate probit analysis demonstrated that BPV during MT was associated with poor functional independence. Multivariable logistic regression showed that age, admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), mechanical ventilation, and thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.17-0.98, P = 0.044) were significantly associated with outcome. RF analysis identified that the interval from last-known-well timeto-groin puncture, age, and mechanical ventilation were among important factors significantly associated with BPV. BPV during MT was associated with functional outcome in univariate probit analysis but not in multivariable regression analysis, however, NIHSS and TICI score were. RF algorithm identified risk factors influencing patients' BPV during MT. While awaiting further studies' results, clinicians should still monitor and avoid high BPV during thrombectomy while triaging AIS-LVO candidates quickly to MT.[Graphics].

TI  - Predicting Deep Hypnotic State From Sleep Brain Rhythms Using Deep Learning: A Data-Repurposing Approach
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND:Brain monitors tracking quantitative brain activities from electroencephalogram (EEG) to predict hypnotic levels have been proposed as a labor-saving alternative to behavioral assessments. Expensive clinical trials are required to validate any newly developed processed EEG monitor for every drug and combinations of drugs due to drug-specific EEG patterns. There is a need for an alternative, efficient, and economical method.METHODS:Using deep learning algorithms, we developed a novel data-repurposing framework to predict hypnotic levels from sleep brain rhythms. We used an online large sleep data set (5723 clinical EEGs) for training the deep learning algorithm and a clinical trial hypnotic data set (30 EEGs) for testing during dexmedetomidine infusion. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC).RESULTS:The deep learning model (a combination of a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory units) trained on sleep EEG predicted deep hypnotic level with an accuracy (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 81 (79.2-88.3)%, AUC (95% CI) = 0.89 (0.82-0.94) using dexmedetomidine as a prototype drug. We also demonstrate that EEG patterns during dexmedetomidine-induced deep hypnotic level are homologous to nonrapid eye movement stage 3 EEG sleep.CONCLUSIONS:We propose a novel method to develop hypnotic level monitors using large sleep EEG data, deep learning, and a data-repurposing approach, and for optimizing such a system for monitoring any given individual. We provide a novel data-repurposing framework to predict hypnosis levels using sleep EEG, eliminating the need for new clinical trials to develop hypnosis level monitors.

TI  - Prediction of Postoperative Complications for Patients of End Stage Renal Disease
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - End stage renal disease (ESRD) is the last stage of chronic kidney disease that requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Many studies reported a higher risk of mortality in ESRD patients compared with patients without ESRD. In this paper, we develop a model to predict postoperative complications, major cardiac event, for patients who underwent any type of surgery. We compare several widely-used machine learning models through experiments with our collected data yellow of size 3220, and achieved F1 score of 0.797 with the random forest model. Based on experimental results, we found that features related to operation (e.g., anesthesia time, operation time, crystal, and colloid) have the biggest impact on model performance, and also found the best combination of features. We believe that this study will allow physicians to provide more appropriate therapy to the ESRD patients by providing information on potential postoperative complications.

TI  - Bolus pharmacokinetics: moving beyond mass-based dosing to guide drug administration
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the common approach of bolus drug dosing using a patient's mass, a more tailored approach would be to use empirically derived pharmacokinetic models. Previously, this could only be possible though the use of computer simulation using programs which are rarely available in clinical practice. Through mathematical manipulations and approximations, a simplified set of equations is demonstrated that can identify a bolus dose required to achieve a specified target effect site concentration. The proposed solution is compared against simulations of a wide variety of pharmacokinetic models. This set of equations provides a near-identical solution to the simulation approach. A boundary condition is established to ensure the derived equations have an acceptable error. This approach may allow for more precise administration of medications with the use of point of care technology and potentially allows for pharmacokinetic dosing in artificial intelligence problems.

TI  - Predicting favorable response to intravenous morphine in pediatric critically ill cardiac patients
T2  - PHARMACOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Analgesia and sedation are integral to the care of critically ill children. However, the choice and dose of the analgesic or sedative drug is often empiric, and models predicting favorable responses are lacking. We aimed to compute models to predict a patient's response to intravenous morphine.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from consecutive patients admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (January 2011-January 2020) who received at least one intravenous bolus of morphine. The primary outcome was a decrease in the State Behavioral Scale (SBS) >= 1 point; the secondary outcome was a decrease in the heart rate Z-score (zHR) at 30 min. Effective doses were modeled using logistic regression, Lasso regression, and random forest modeling.Results: A total of 117,495 administrations of intravenous morphine among 8140 patients (median age 0.6 years [interquartile range [IQR] 0.19, 3.3]) were included. The median morphine dose was 0.051 mg/kg (IQR 0.048, 0.099) and the median 30-day cumulative dose was 2.2 mg/kg (IQR 0.4, 15.3). SBS decreased following 30% of doses, did not change following 45%, and increased following 25%. The zHR significantly decreased after morphine administration (median delta-zHR -0.34 [IQR-1.03, 0.00], p < 0.001). The following factors were associated with favorable response to morphine: A concomitant infusion of propofol, higher prior 30-day cumulative dose, being invasively ventilated and/or on vasopressors. Higher morphine dose, higher zHR pre-morphine, an additional analgosedation bolus +/- 30 min around the index bolus, a concomitant ketamine or dexmedetomidine infusion, and showing signs of withdrawal syndrome were associated with unfavorable response. Logistic regression (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC] 0.900) and machine learning models ( AUC 0.906) performed comparably, with a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 71%, and negative predictive value of 97%.Conclusions: Statistical models identify 95% of effective intravenous morphine doses in pediatric critically ill cardiac patients, while incorrectly suggesting an effective dose in 29% of cases. This work represents an important step toward computer-aided, personalized clinical decision support tool for sedation and analgesia in ICU patients.

TI  - Predictive Analytics for Inpatient Postoperative Opioid Use in Patients Undergoing Mastectomy
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The use of opioids in mastectomy patients is a particular challenge, having to balance the management of acute pain while minimizing risks of continuous opioid use postoperatively. Despite attempts to decrease postmastectomy opioid use, including regional anesthetics, gabapentinoids, topical anesthetics, and nonopioid anesthesia, prolonged opioid use remains clinically significant among these patients. The goal of this study is to identify risk factors and develop machine-learning-based models to predict patients who are at higher risk for postoperative opioid use after mastectomy.Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we collected data from patients that underwent mastectomy procedures. The primary outcome of interest was defined as oxycodone milligram equivalents (OME) greater than or equal to the 75% of OME use on a postoperative day 1. Model performance (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC)) of various machine learning approaches was calculated via 10-fold cross-validation. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported.Results: There were a total of 148 patients that underwent mastectomy and were included. The medium (quartiles) postoperative day 1 opioid use was 5 mg OME (0.25 mg OME). Using multivariable logistic regression, the most protective factors against higher opioid use was being postmenopausal (OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03-0.61, p = 0.009) and cancer diagnosis (OR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05-0.73, p = 0.01). The AUC was 0.725 (95% CI: 0.572-0.876). There was no difference in the performance of other machine-learning-based approaches.Conclusions: The ability to predict patients' postoperative pain could have a significant impact on preoperative counseling and patient satisfaction.

TI  - Multi-omic molecular profiling and network biology for precision anaesthesiology: a narrative review
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Technological advancement, data democratisation, and decreasing costs have led to a revolution in molecular biology in which the entire set of DNA, RNA, proteins, and various other molecules -the 'multi-omic' profile -can be measured in humans. Sequencing 1 million bases of human DNA now costs US$0.01, and emerging technologies soon promise to reduce the cost of sequencing the whole genome to US$100. These trends have made it feasible to sample the multi-omic profile of millions of people, much of which is publicly available for medical research. Can anaesthesiologists use these data to improve patient care? This narrative review brings together a rapidly growing literature in multi-omic profiling across numerous fields that points to the future of precision anaesthesiology. Here, we discuss how DNA, RNA, proteins, and other molecules interact in molecular networks that can be used for preoperative risk stratification, intraoperative optimisation, and postoperative monitoring. This literature provides evidence for four fundamental insights: (1) Clini-cally similar patients have different molecular profiles and, as a consequence, different outcomes. (2) Vast, publicly available, and rapidly growing molecular datasets have been generated in chronic disease patients and can be repur-posed to estimate perioperative risk. (3) Multi-omic networks are altered in the perioperative period and influence postoperative outcomes. (4) Multi-omic networks can serve as empirical, molecular measurements of a successful postoperative course. With this burgeoning universe of molecular data, the anaesthesiologist-of-the-future will tailor their clinical management to an individual's multi-omic profile to optimise postoperative outcomes and long-term health.

TI  - Culturally Adapted Pain Management for Indigenous Peoples in the Pacific Northwest (CAP-I)
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe prevalence of chronic pain is higher among American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) people than any othergroup in the United States. Although a number of psychosocial interventions for chronic pain are well-establishedas effective, there are no culturally adapted interventions for AI/AN individuals. This proposed study aims tobegin the process of developing a culturally-adapted psychosocial pain intervention for AI/AN individuals at thePortland Area Indian Health Service – Yakama Service Unit. The K99 phase will focus on the development ofthe intervention and the R00 will entail a feasibility randomized pilot trial. During the K99 phase, focus groupswill aid the in the development of a treatment manual, workbooks, and procedures for a culturally appropriatepsychosocial pain intervention (Specific Aim 1). After developing a prototype intervention, focus groups will thenprovide feedback to improve the intervention (Specific Aim 2). Specific Aim 3 is to assess the feasibility ofconducting a future randomized controlled trial with the developed intervention from the K99 phase. Thisresearch will provide pilot data for an NIH R01 proposal which will be prepared and submitted towards the endof the R00 phase. The long-term objective of the proposed Pathway to Independence Award is to support theapplicant in transitioning into an independent research scientist who studies chronic pain disparities andconducts intervention research in AI/AN communities. The candidate's prior research in chronic pain disparitiesin low-income communities in Alabama, community-based participatory research, and chronic pain trials are astrong match for this current proposed project. With the current project, she will expand her knowledge andexpertise into an important new area of research that has largely been neglected by the research community.With this project, the candidate will have the mentoring and training necessary for enhancing cultural competencyin working with AI/AN individuals (Training Goal 1), gaining skills in conducting community-based participatoryresearch with AI/AN communities (Training Goal 2), and fostering skills in the development, adaptation,implementation, and dissemination in clinical trials (Training Goal 3). Drs. Jensen, Walters, Rhudy, and Fuenteswill serve as mentors and offer expertise in the areas of chronic pain intervention research, cultural adaptationsfor psychosocial interventions for AI/AN individuals, tribal based research, and community-based researchmethods with AI/AN communities. The University of Washington training environment provides significantresources and support that would facilitate the development of skills and expertise needed for the applicant totransition into an independent research scientist. The Yakama Service Unit is strongly committed to thisproposed study and will provide critical support in recruitment, retention, and space for focus groups andtreatment. Because each tribal community has their own values, traditions, and culture, the proposed study willoffer a step-by-step process for culturally adapting chronic pain interventions that may extend to tribalcommunities across the country.

TI  - A Five-Decade Text Mining Analysis of Cochlear Implant Research: Where We Started and Where We Are Heading
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Since its invention in the 1970s, the cochlear implant (CI) has been substantially developed. We aimed to assess the trends in the published literature to characterize CI. Materials and Methods: We queried PubMed for all CI-related entries published during 1970-2022. The following data were extracted: year of publication, publishing journal, title, keywords, and abstract text. Search terms belonged to the patient's age group, etiology for hearing loss, indications for CI, and surgical methodological advancement. Annual trends of publications were plotted. The slopes of publication trends were calculated by fitting regression lines to the yearly number of publications. Results: Overall, 19,428 CIs articles were identified. Pediatric-related CI was the most dominant sub population among the age groups, with the highest rate and slope during the years (slope 5.2 +/- 0.3, p < 0.001), while elderly-related CIs had significantly fewer publications. Entries concerning hearing preservation showed the sharpest rise among the methods, from no entries in 1980 to 46 entries in 2021 (slope 1.7 +/- 0.2, p < 0.001). Entries concerning robotic surgery emerged in 2000, with a sharp increase in recent years (slope 0.5 +/- 0.1, p < 0.001). Drug-eluting electrodes and CI under local-anesthesia have been reported only in the past five years, with a gradual rise. Conclusions: Publications regarding CI among pediatrics outnumbered all other indications, supporting the rising, pivotal role of CI in the rehabilitation of children with sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing-preservation publications have recently rapidly risen, identified as the primary trend of the current era, followed by a sharp rise of robotic surgery that is evolving and could define the next revolution.

TI  - Consciousness depends on integration between parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus
T2  - CELL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The neural substrates of consciousness remain elusive. Competing theories that attempt to explain consciousness disagree on the contribution of frontal versus posterior cortex and omit subcortical influences. This lack of understanding impedes the ability to monitor consciousness, which can lead to adverse clinical consequences. To test substrates and measures of consciousness, we recorded simultaneously from frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and subcortical structures, the striatum and thalamus, in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We manipulated consciousness on a finer scale using thalamic stimulation, rousing macaques from continuously administered anesthesia. Our results show that, unlike measures targeting complexity, a measure additionally capturing neural integration (Phi*) robustly correlated with changes in consciousness. Machine learning approaches show parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus contributed more than frontal cortex to decoding differences in consciousness. These findings highlight the importance of integration between parietal and subcortical structures and challenge a key role for frontal cortex in consciousness.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) can replace general anesthesia (GA), improving pain control and recovery time. This method can be applied on the brachial plexus (BP) after clavicular surgeries. However, identification of the BP from ultrasound (US) images is difficult, even for trained professionals. To address this problem, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and more advanced deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used for identification and segmentation of the BP nerve region. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model consisting of a classification model followed by a segmentation model to segment BP nerve regions in ultrasound images. A CNN model is employed as a classifier to precisely select the images with the BP region. Then, a U-net or M-net model is used for the segmentation. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid model significantly improves the segmentation performance over a single segmentation model.

TI  - Multimodal spatio-temporal-spectral fusion for deep learning applications in physiological time series processing: A case study in monitoring the depth of anesthesia
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Physiological signals processing brings challenges including dimensionality (due to the number of channels), heterogeneity (due to the different range of values) and multimodality (due to the different sources). In this regard, the current study intended, first, to use time-frequency ridge mapping in exploring the use of fused information from joint EEG-ECG recordings in tracking the transition between different states of anesthesia. Second, it investigated the effectiveness of pre-trained state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for learning discriminative features in the fused data in order to classify the states during anesthesia. Experimental data from healthy-brain patients undergoing operation (N = 20) were used for this study. Data was recorded from the BrainStatus device with single ECG and 10 EEG channels. The obtained results support the hypothesis that not only can ridge fusion capture temporal-spectral progression patterns across all modalities and channels, but also this simplified interpretation of time-frequency representation accelerates the training process and yet improves significantly the efficiency of deep models. Classification outcomes demonstrates that this fusion could yields a better performance, in terms of 94.14% precision and 0.28 s prediction time, compared to commonly used datalevel fusing methods. To conclude, the proposed fusion technique provides the possibility of embedding timefrequency information as well as spatial dependencies over modalities and channels in just a 2D array. This integration technique shows significant benefit in obtaining a more unified and global view of different aspects of physiological data at hand, and yet maintaining the desired performance level in decision making.

TI  - Why pharmacovigilance of traditional medicines used as analgesics is important?
T2  - TRADITIONAL MEDICINE RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Traditional remedies have gained recognition for their effectiveness in treating various conditions such as diabetes, arthritic pain, liver disease, cough and cold, memory enhancement, and immunological stimulation. Their perceived safety has led to the increasing use of herbs by people without prescriptions. These therapies remain significant in areas with limited access to modern drugs or cultural preferences for traditional treatments. With a long history of use, traditional medicines have been the primary method of pain management. This review article explores natural and herb-based analgesics, their origins, and potential benefits, along with the growing scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness. Studies have examined their efficacy in treating musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, and migraines. Rather than being seen as separate therapies, traditional medicines should be considered supplementary or alternative options that can be integrated into comprehensive pain management regimens. However, some studies have reported adverse drug reactions associated with herbal formulations and plants. Therefore, there is a need for pharmacovigilance in traditional medicine to ensure patient safety and promote evidence-based practices. Although pharmacovigilance in this field is still developing, it faces challenges due to the wide availability of herbal medicines without on-site medical supervision. This paper discusses the complex challenges of herbal pharmacovigilance, provides insights on recent advancements, and offers recommendations for improving the safety monitoring of traditional medications in the future.

M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - In recent years, people's living standards are getting higher and higher, and life pressure is also increasing, and there are also many problems in eating habits. This is also the direct cause of colon cancer. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether anesthetic drugs could positively affect the proliferation and apoptosis of colon cancer cells. In this paper, the significance of anesthetic drugs is proposed, and an artificial neural network algorithm based on artificial intelligence is proposed. It is well known that artificial neural networks play an important role in medicine. The experimental results of this paper show that the incidence of colon cancer in 2020 will be in the range of 5%-35%, and the incidence of colon cancer in 2021 will be in the range of 7%-30%. While colon cancer rates in 2021 do not appear to be as high as colon cancer rates in 2020, they are generally much higher than colon cancer rates in 2020. It can be seen that as the population ages, the number of colon cancer patients is increasing due to the lack of emphasis on health. This also means that the incidence of colon cancer is getting higher and higher, and traditional drug chemotherapy has been unable to play a good role in inhibiting the proliferation of colon cancer cells. Therefore, this paper investigated the effects of anesthetic drugs on the proliferation and apoptosis of human colon cancer cells.

TI  - Clinical Application of Artificial Intelligence: Auto-Discerning the Effectiveness of Lidocaine Concentration Levels in Osteosarcoma Femoral Tumor Segment Resection (Retracted Article)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - Adolescents and children worldwide are threatened by osteosarcoma, a tumor that predominantly affects the long bone epiphysis. Osteosarcoma is the most common and highly malignant bone tumor in youngsters. Early tumor detection is the key to effective treatment of this disease. The discovery of biomarkers and the growing understanding of molecules and their complex interactions have improved the outcome of clinical trials in osteosarcoma. This article describes biomarkers of osteosarcoma with the aim of positively influencing the progress of clinical treatment of osteosarcoma. Femoral bone tumor is a typical condition of osteosarcoma. Due to the wide range of femoral stem types, complexities in the distal femur, and tumors in the rotor part of femur, physicians following the traditional clinical approach face difficulties in removing the lesion and fixing the femur with resection of the tumor segment. In this paper, the effect of small doses of different concentrations of lidocaine anesthesia in patients undergoing lumpectomy for osteosarcoma femoral tumor segments is investigated. A computer-based artificial intelligence method for automated determination of different concentration levels of lidocaine anesthesia and amputation of osteosarcoma femoral tumor segment is proposed. Statistical analysis is carried on the empirical data including intraoperative bleeding, intraoperative and postoperative pain scores, surgical operation time, postoperative complications, patient satisfaction, and local anesthetic dose. The results showed that the patients in the study group had low intraoperative bleeding, short operation time, low postoperative hematoma formation rate, high patient satisfaction, higher dosage of anesthetic solution, and low dosage of lidocaine. Results revealed that mean arterial pressure and heart rate in extubating and intubating were significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group, and a significant difference (P<0.05) was observed between the two groups. This proves that the proposed algorithm can adequately reduce bleeding, alleviate postoperative pain, shorten operation time, reduce complications, accelerate recovery, and ensure better treatment results.

TI  - Machine learning for prediction of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a still highly relevant problem and is known to be a distressing side effect in patients. The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning model to predict PONV up to 24 h with fentanyl-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA). Methods From July 2019 and July 2020, data from 2,149 patients who received fentanyl-based IV-PCA for analgesia after non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia were applied to develop predictive models. The rates of PONV at 1 day after surgery were measured according to patient characteristics as well as anesthetic, surgical, or PCA-related factors. All statistical analyses and computations were performed using the R software. Results A total of 2,149 patients were enrolled in this study, 337 of whom (15.7%) experienced PONV. After applying the machine-learning algorithm and Apfel model to the test dataset to predict PONV, we found that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using logistic regression was 0.576 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.520-0.633), k-nearest neighbor was 0.597 (95% CI, 0.537-0.656), decision tree was 0.561 (95% CI, 0.498-0.625), random forest was 0.610 (95% CI, 0.552-0.668), gradient boosting machine was 0.580 (95% CI, 0.520-0.639), support vector machine was 0.649 (95% CI, 0.592-0.707), artificial neural network was 0.686 (95% CI, 0.630-0.742), and Apfel model was 0.643 (95% CI, 0.596-0.690). Conclusions We developed and validated machine learning models for predicting PONV in the first 24 h. The machine learning model showed better performance than the Apfel model in predicting PONV.

TI  - Water exchange versus air insufflation for colonoscopy: A meta-analysis
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background/Aims: To compare water exchange (WE) method with conventional air insufflation (AI) method for colonoscopy, evaluating the technical quality, screening efficacy, and patients' acceptance.Materials and Methods: Electronic databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials comparing WE colonoscopy with AI colonoscopy. The pooled data of procedure-associated and patient-related outcomes were assessed, using the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous variables and relative risk (RR) with 95% CI for dichotomous variables, respectively.Results: A total of 13 studies involving 7056 patients were included. The cecum intubation rate was similar between WE and AI methods (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.99-1.02, P = 0.37); however, a significantly longer cecum intubation time was shown in WE group (WMD = 1.56, 95% CI = 0.75-2.37, P = 0.002). Compared with AI, WE was associated with a higher risk of adenoma detection rate (ADR) (RR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.18-1.38, P < 0.00001) and polyp detection rate (PDR) (RR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.21-1.39, P < 0.00001). Patients in WE group experienced significantly less maximum pain score (WMD = -1.99, 95% CI = -2.68 to -1.30, P < 0.00001) and less requested on-demand sedation (RR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.44-0.77, P = 0.0002). Likewise, they also experienced less abdominal compression (RR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.51-0.74, P < 0.00001) and reposition (RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.63-0.86, P = 0.0001). Moreover, patients' willingness to repeat colonoscopy was significantly greater for WE (RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.07-1.21, P < 0.0001).Conclusion: This meta-analysis confirmed that WE method could significantly increase ADR/PDR and improve patients' acceptance of colonoscopy, while reducing the degree of pain and minimize the need for on-demand sedation and adjunct maneuvers, despite requiring more cecal intubation time.

T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUNDEsophageo-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) is an important procedure used for detection and diagnosis of esophago-gastric lesions. There exists no consensus on the technique of examination.AIMTo identify recent advances in diagnostic EGDs to improve diagnostic yield.METHODSWe queried the PubMed database for relevant articles published between January 2001 and August 2019 as well as hand searched references from recently published endoscopy guidelines. Keywords used included free text and MeSH terms addressing quality indicators and technological innovations in EGDs. Factors affecting diagnostic yield and EGD quality were identified and divided into the follow segments: Pre endoscopy preparation, sedation, examination schema, examination time, routine biopsy, image enhanced endoscopy and future developments.RESULTSWe identified 120 relevant abstracts of which we utilized 67 of these studies in our review. Adequate pre-endoscopy preparation with simethicone and pronase increases gastric visibility. Proper sedation, especially with propofol, increases patient satisfaction after procedure and may improve detection of superficial gastrointestinal lesions. There is a movement towards mandatory picture documentation during EGD as well as dedicating sufficient time for examination improves diagnostic yield. The use of image enhanced endoscopy and magnifying endoscopy improves detection of squamous cell carcinoma and gastric neoplasm. The magnifying endoscopy simple diagnostic algorithm is useful for diagnosis of early gastric cancer.CONCLUSIONThere is a steady momentum in the past decade towards improving diagnostic yield, quality and reporting in EGDs. Other interesting innovations, such as Raman spectroscopy, endocytoscopy and artificial intelligence may have widespread endoscopic applications in the near future.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The current service evaluation aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on patients' experiences of pain management therapy. The study examined the barriers and benefits of the move from face-to-face to eHealth methods of delivery. Design A service evaluation was conducted in an outpatient pain clinic in an NHS Trust in the East of England. A qualitative approach was taken using semi-structured interviews. Methods Participants were recruited through a health psychology service operating as part of a multidisciplinary pain management clinic. Six patients, aged 39-67, were interviewed one-to-one using the online platform Zoom(TM). During COVID-19, participants had individual or group pain management therapy via telephone or video conferencing. All interviews were transcribed using Otter.ai(TM) and thematic analysis was performed. The study was approved by internal clinical governance for service evaluations and the authors adhered to the BPS Code of Human Research Ethics. Results Three key themes emerged from the analysis; Benefits Aside From Pain Relief, Limited Their Experience, and COVID-19: A Double-Edged Sword. Conclusion Findings suggested patients were able to benefit from pain management therapy despite the impact of COVID-19 on daily routines and pain experience. Adopting eHealth methods during the pandemic was an effective means of accessing pain management therapy. These methods allowed patients to continue to benefit from peer support and learn about skills and resources regarding self-management, whilst also improving accessibility for those with chronic pain. Yet, these methods are not without their limitations. Technical issues and difficulties creating therapeutic connections with psychologists limited patients' experience of pain management therapy.

TI  - Development of a regional anesthesia guidance system to increase patient access to opioid-sparing analgesia for hip fracture pain
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTFor the >330,000 Americans that are hospitalized for hip fractures yearly, rapid treatment of pain and surgicalintervention is critical to recover mobility and reduce the risk of death. Parenteral opioids are the standard ofcare to manage acute hip fracture pain but increase the risk of adverse events and outcomes, includingdelirium and recurrent opioid use. Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) techniques, such as thepericapsular nerve group (PENG) block, are an effective alternative to opioids that could be used for > 300,000patients annually to decrease consumption of opioids and improve outcomes. However, utilization of UGRA inthe emergency department (ED) is primarily limited by ED-specific workflow challenges and lack of access tothe training required for competency. Thus, there is a clear need to increase utilization of opioid-sparing UGRAfor hip fracture pain, and it is likely that a technological advancement that reduces the training and workflowrequirements of administering UGRA is required to meet this need. During this project, an ultrasound-based hip regional anesthesia guidance system will be developedunder a quality management system (QMS) certified to ISO 13485:2016 and 21 CFR Part 820. The keytechnological innovations underpinning the development of this product include the following: 2D and 3Dimaging algorithms that highlight bony anatomy and soft tissue landmarks, anatomical recognition capabilitiesthat automate injection site selection, a novel dual-array ultrasound probe that enables ‘through-the-probe’needle trajectories, a single-use sterile consumable designed to simplify workflow, and a needle-visualizationimaging mode that highlights the advancing needle to the user. The primary technical tasks during the earlystages of the project period include the execution of end-user clinical usability studies to guide technicalspecification development and implementation of machine learning networks to guide the PENG block.Successful completion of these technical aims will result in the fabrication of pre-production systems for pre-clinical validation studies that will be conducted later in the project period. Pre-clinical product validation activities will include cadaver and human-imaging studies performed incollaboration with clinical experts who will verify that the system meets the requirements for the clinicalapplication. The primary endpoint for the pre-clinical cadaveric studies is a direct measurement of the accuracyof needle placement for the PENG block, as confirmed by CT imaging. Additionally, a second pre-clinical studyusing cadaveric specimens will characterize the learning curve required to reach competency with the systemby studying the needle placement accuracy achieved by 25 ED physicians over multiple simulated procedures. Completion of this research project will result in the development and fabrication of a human clinical-trial-ready 3D-capable ultrasound-imaging system to support facile administration of UGRA for hip fracture painby minimizing training and workflow barriers to utilization.

TI  - Design and implementation of a smart Internet of Things chest pain center based on deep learning
T2  - MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The data input process for most chest pain centers is not intelligent, requiring a lot of staff to manually input patient information. This leads to problems such as long processing times, high potential for errors, an inability to access patient data in a timely manner and an increasing workload. To address the challenge, an Internet of Things (IoT)-driven chest pain center is designed, which crosses the sensing layer, network layer and application layer. The system enables the construction of intelligent chest pain management through a pre-hospital app, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) positioning, and in-hospital treatment. The pre-hospital app is provided to emergency medical services (EMS) centers, which allows them to record patient information in advance and keep it synchronized with the hospital's database, reducing the time needed for treatment. UWB positioning obtains the patient's hospital information through the zero-dimensional base station and the corresponding calculation engine, and in-hospital treatment involves automatic acquisition of patient information through web and mobile applications. The system also introduces the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Conditional Random Field (CRF)-based algorithm to train electronic medical record information for chest pain patients, extracting the patient's chest pain clinical symptoms. The resulting data are saved in the chest pain patient database and uploaded to the national chest pain center. The system has been used in Liaoning Provincial People's Hospital, and its subsequent assistance to doctors and nurses in collaborative treatment, data feedback and analysis is of great significance.

M3  - Article
AB  - Anesthesia, perioperative and critical care medicine are specific areas where registries, biobanks and big data are gaining a leading role in increasing knowledge and improving patients' care. The adoption of these robust data infrastructures - aimed at bridling, manipulating, aggregating, and linking patients' multiparametric data - supports anesthesiologists and intensive care physicians in several aspects of bedside practice and clinical research. Indeed, registries-integrated calculators may promote the concept of personalized medicine acting as "sniffers," electronic alarm systems, or decision support systems. Artificial intelligence applied to large databases or meta-registries may further increase dramatically this functionality, identify associations among thousands of different and only apparently uncorrelated variables. From a research perspective, large datasets are increasingly mined to create observations about medical care beyond prospective randomized clinical trials enrolling thousands of patients, often only presumably homogeneous ore well-balanced. Registries in this context may effectively explore the association between patients' management and patients' outcomes with a negligible impact on ethical issues, limited costs, and easy management. Finally, registries may promote self-evaluation and continuous quality improvement in the field of perioperative and critical care medicine. In a different way, the role of biobanks primarily relies on translational medical research. These allow rapidly creating pools of biological samples available for epidemiological description, pathophysiological definition, and treatment effectiveness verification, basically acting as an accelerator of knowledge production in critical care and perioperative medicine. Nowadays, registries and biobanks are thus routine tools for anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. (Cite this article as: Villa G, Romagnoli S. Registers and biobanks in ICU and anesthesia.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We aimed to demonstrate that supervised machine learning (ML) models can better predict postoperative complications after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) than comorbidity indices.Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried from 2005-2017 for TSA cases. Training and validation sets were created by randomly assigning 80% and 20% of the data set. Included variables were age, body mass index (BMI), operative time, smoking status, comorbidities, diagnosis, and preoperative hematocrit and albumin. Complications included any adverse event, transfusion, extended length of stay (>3 days), surgical site infection, return to the operating room, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and readmission. Each SML algorithm was compared with one another and to a baseline model using American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification. Model strength was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the positive predictive value (PPV) of complications.Results: We identified a total of 17,119 TSA cases. Mean age, BMI, and length of stay were 69.5 +/- 9.6 years, 31.1 +/- 6.8, and 2.0 +/- 2.2 days. Percentage hematocrit, BMI, and operative time were of highest importance in outcome prediction. SML algorithms outperformed ASA classification models for predicting any adverse event (71.0% vs. 63.0%), transfusion (77.0% vs. 64.0%), extended length of stay (68.0% vs. 60.0%), surgical site infection (65.0% vs. 58.0%), return to the operating room (59.0% vs. 54.0%), and readmission (64.0% vs. 58.0%). SML algorithms demonstrated the greatest PPV for any adverse event (623%), extended length of stay (61.4%), transfusion (52.2%), and readmission (10.1%). ASA classification had a 0.0% PPV for complications.Conclusion: With continued validation, intelligent models could calculate patient-specific risk for complications to adjust perioperative care and site of surgery.

TI  - Prediction of Prolonged Opioid Use After Surgery in Adolescents: Insights From Machine Learning
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term opioid use has negative health care consequences. Patients who undergo surgery are at risk for prolonged opioid use after surgery (POUS). While risk factors have been previously identified, no methods currently exist to determine higher-risk patients. We assessed the ability of a variety of machine-learning algorithms to predict adolescents at risk of POUS and to identify factors associated with this risk. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a national insurance claims database of adolescents aged 12-21 years who underwent 1 of 1297 surgeries, with general anesthesia, from January 1, 2011 to December 30, 2017. Logistic regression with an L2 penalty and with a logistic regression with an L1 lasso (Lasso) penalty, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and extreme gradient boosted models were trained using patient and provider characteristics to predict POUS (>= 1 opioid prescription fill within 90-180 days after surgery) risk. Predictive capabilities were assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC)/C-statistic, mean average precision (MAP); individual decision thresholds were compared using sensitivity, specificity, Youden Index, F1 score, and number needed to evaluate. The variables most strongly associated with POUS risk were identified using permutation importance. RESULTS: Of 186,493 eligible patient surgical visits, 8410 (4.51%) had POUS. The top-performing algorithm achieved an overall AUC of 0.711 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.699-0.723) and significantly higher AUCs for certain surgeries (eg, 0.823 for spinal fusion surgery and 0.812 for dental surgery). The variables with the strongest association with POUS were the days' supply of opioids and oral morphine milligram equivalents of opioids in the year before surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning models to predict POUS risk among adolescents show modest to strong results for different surgeries and reveal variables associated with higher risk. These results may inform health care system-specific identification of patients at higher risk for POUS and drive development of preventative measures.

TI  - Machine learning prediction of postoperative unplanned 30-day hospital readmission in older adult
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Although unplanned hospital readmission is an important indicator for monitoring the perioperative quality of hospital care, few published studies of hospital readmission have focused on surgical patient populations, especially in the elderly. We aimed to investigate if machine learning approaches can be used to predict postoperative unplanned 30-day hospital readmission in old surgical patients.Methods: We extracted demographic, comorbidity, laboratory, surgical, and medication data of elderly patients older than 65 who underwent surgeries under general anesthesia in West China Hospital, Sichuan University from July 2019 to February 2021. Different machine learning approaches were performed to evaluate whether unplanned 30-day hospital readmission can be predicted. Model performance was assessed using the following metrics: AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Calibration of predictions was performed using Brier Score. A feature ablation analysis was performed, and the change in AUC with the removal of each feature was then assessed to determine feature importance.Results: A total of 10,535 unique surgeries and 10,358 unique surgical elderly patients were included. The overall 30-day unplanned readmission rate was 3.36%. The AUCs of the six machine learning algorithms predicting postoperative 30-day unplanned readmission ranged from 0.6865 to 0.8654. The RF + XGBoost algorithm overall performed the best with an AUC of 0.8654 (95% CI, 0.8484-0.8824), accuracy of 0.9868 (95% CI, 0.9834-0.9902), precision of 0.3960 (95% CI, 0.3854-0.4066), recall of 0.3184 (95% CI, 0.259-0.3778), and F1 score of 0.4909 (95% CI, 0.3907-0.5911). The Brier scores of the six machine learning algorithms predicting postoperative 30-day unplanned readmission ranged from 0.3721 to 0.0464, with RF + XGBoost showing the best calibration capability. The most five important features of RF + XGBoost were operation duration, white blood cell count, BMI, total bilirubin concentration, and blood glucose concentration.Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms can accurately predict postoperative unplanned 30-day readmission in elderly surgical patients.

T2  - COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objective: In the last decade, Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia (UGRA) gained importance in surgical procedures and pain management, due to its ability to perform target delivery of local anesthetics under direct sonographic visualization. However, practicing UGRA can be challenging, since it requires high skilled and experienced operator. Among the difficult task that the operator can face, is the tracking of the nerve structure in ultrasound images. Tracking task in US images is very challenging due to the noise and other artifacts.Methods: In this paper, we introduce a new and robust tracking technique by using Adaptive Median Binary Pattern(AMBP) as texture feature for tracking algorithms (particle filter, mean-shift and Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi(KLT)). Moreover, we propose to incorporate Kalman filter as prediction and correction steps for the tracking algorithms, in order to enhance the accuracy, computational cost and handle target disappearance.Results: The proposed method have been applied on real data and evaluated in different situations. The obtained results show that tracking with AMBP features outperforms other descriptors and achieved best performance with 95% accuracy.Conclusions: This paper presents the first fully automatic nerve tracking method in Ultrasound images. AMBP features outperforms other descriptors in all situations such as noisy and filtered images. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - Chinese Journal of Anesthesiology
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the effect of general anesthesia guided by electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring on postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with non-acute fragile brain function.Methods Sixty patients of both sexes with non-acute fragile brain function,aged 65-85 yr,of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II or III,with body mass index of 18-30 kg/m~2,undergoing hip replacement,were divided into 2 groups (n = 30 each) by a random number table method:conventional general anesthesia group (group C) and general anesthesia guided by EEG monitoring group (group E).Anesthesia was maintained by intravenous infusion of propofol 50-150 g ·kg~(-1) ·min~(-1) and remifentanil 0.05-0.30 g.kg~(-1) ·min~(-1)and intermittent intravenous boluses of rocuronium.In group E,the dose of anesthetic was reduced when the EEG burst-suppression ratio≥ 10% for more than 1 min or anesthesia index (AI) <40.If the situation mentioned above still existed after 1 min,the dose of anesthetic was continued to be reduced or norepinephrine was injected intravenously.In group C,the amount of intraoperative anesthesia was adjusted according to the changes in hemodynamics.Norepinephrine 4-10 g or dopamine 1 mg was given intravenously in the light of the patients' heart rates when intraoperative hypotension occurred.At 10 min after anesthesia induction,immediately after skin incision,immediately at the end of surgery and at 1 h after surgery,blood samples were obtained from the artery and jugular venous bulb for blood gas analysis and for calculation of jugular bulb blood oxygen content (CjvO2),artery-jugular bulb blood oxygen content difference (Ca-jvO2),cerebral oxygen uptake rate (CERO2) and jugular-arterial blood lactate concentration difference (Djv-aLac).The emergence time,amounts of intraoperative anesthetics,use of noradrenaline,cumulative time of EEG burst inhibition and duration of AI<40 were recorded.The development of POD was assessed within 5 days after surgery by the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit and the duration was recorded.Results Compared with group C,recovery time,cumulative time of EEG burst inhibition and duration of AI<40 were significantly shortened,the intraoperative consumption of propofol and remifentanil was decreased,the requirement for intraoperative noradrenaline was increased,CjvO2 was increased,Ca-jvO2 and CERO2 were decreased immediately at the end of surgery and at 1 h after surgery,the incidence of POD within 5 days after surgery was decreased,and POD duration was shortened in group E (P<0.05).Conclusion General anesthesia guided by EEG monitoring can reduce the development of POD in elderly patients with non-acute fragile brain function.

TI  - Preoperative echocardiography predictive analytics for postinduction hypotension prediction
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Hypotension is a risk factor for adverse perioperative outcomes. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography has been extended for preoperative risk assessment before noncardiac surgery. This study aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict postinduction hypotension risk using preoperative echocardiographic data and compared it with conventional statistic models. We also aimed to identify preoperative echocardiographic factors that cause postinduction hypotension.Methods In this retrospective observational study, we extracted data from electronic health records of patients aged >18 years who underwent general anesthesia at a single tertiary care center between April 2014 and September 2019. Multiple supervised machine learning classification techniques were used, with postinduction hypotension (mean arterial pressure <55 mmHg from intubation to the start of the procedure) as the primary outcome and 95 transthoracic echocardiography measurements as factors influencing the primary outcome. Based on the mean cross-validation performance, we used 10-fold cross-validation with the training set (70%) to select the optimal hyperparameters and architecture, assessed ten times using a separate test set (30%).Results Of 1,956 patients, 670 (34%) had postinduction hypotension. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using the deep neural network was 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.67-0.76), gradient boosting machine was 0.54 (95% CI = 0.51-0.59), linear discriminant analysis was 0.56 (95% CI = 0.51-0.61), and logistic regression was 0.56 (95% CI = 0.51-0.61). Variables of high importance included the ascending aorta diameter, transmitral flow A wave, heart rate, pulmonary venous flow S wave, tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient, inferior vena cava expiratory diameter, fractional shortening, left ventricular mass index, and end-systolic volume.Conclusion We have created developing models that can predict postinduction hypotension using preoperative echocardiographic data, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of using machine learning models of preoperative echocardiographic data for produce higher accuracy than the conventional model.

Thereare likely a number of reasons for this poor performance, including the relative rarity of difficult intubation, themultifactorial etiology and varying definition of difficult intubation, inter-observer variability in test results, failureto validate potential systems in patients independent of those used to derive the test, and the inadequacy ofthe tests themselves.intubation (EI) is a common medical procedure in which a plastic tube is introduced via theinto the trachea, to provide respiratory support during general anesthesia or to amelioratedifficulty in cases of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or other forms of critical illness.

TI  - A New Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning Method for Effective Chemotherapy
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A key challenge for drug dosing schedules is the ability to learn an optimal control policy even when there is a paucity of accurate information about the systems. Artificial intelligence has great potential for shaping a smart control policy for the dosage of drugs for any treatment. Motivated by this issue, in the present research paper a Caputo-Fabrizio fractional-order model of cancer chemotherapy treatment was elaborated and analyzed. A fix-point theorem and an iterative method were implemented to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the proposed model. Afterward, in order to control cancer through chemotherapy treatment, a fuzzy-reinforcement learning-based control method that uses the State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) algorithm was proposed. Finally, so as to assess the performance of the proposed control method, the simulations were conducted for young and elderly patients and for ten simulated patients with different parameters. Then, the results of the proposed control method were compared with Watkins's Q-learning control method for cancer chemotherapy drug dosing. The results of the simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed control method in terms of mean squared error, mean variance of the error, and the mean squared of the control action-in other words, in terms of the eradication of tumor cells, keeping normal cells, and the amount of usage of the drug during chemotherapy treatment.

TI  - Designing an Ethical and Secure Pain Estimation System Using AI Sandbox for Contactless Healthcare
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONLINE AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pain estimation in patients having communication difficulties is vital for preventing adverse consequences such as misdiagnosis, delayed treatment, and increased suffering. Traditional pain assessment tools relying on observer-based ratings and patient self-reporting are hampered by subjectivity and the need for continuous human monitoring, which have the potential to lead to inaccurate or delayed pain estimation. This paper presents an extensive literature review, a conceptual framework, and a systematic procedure for helping researchers develop a contactless, multimodal pain estimation system that leverages AI-based automation of standard pain assessment tools and scales within an AI sandbox environment. Our proposed concept aims to improve the efficiency of traditional pain estimation systems while reducing subjectivity and physical contact. This approach offers potential benefits, such as more accurate and timely pain assessment, reduced burden on healthcare professionals, and improved patient experiences. Moreover, the integration of the AI sandbox allows researchers and developers to experiment with AI models, algorithms, and systems safely and securely, ensuring that AI systems are reliable and robust before deployment. We also discuss potential challenges and ethical considerations related to the use of AI in pain estimation, emphasizing the importance of addressing these concerns to ensure the safe and responsible integration of this technology into healthcare systems. The paper lays a foundation for future research and innovation in pain management, ultimately contributing to better patient care and advancements in the field.

TI  - Defining and Predicting Pain Volatility in Users of the Manage My Pain App: Analysis Using Data Mining and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Measuring and predicting pain volatility (fluctuation or variability in pain scores over time) can help improve pain management. Perceptions of pain and its consequent disabling effects are often heightened under the conditions of greater uncertainty and unpredictability associated with pain volatility.Objective: This study aimed to use data mining and machine learning methods to (1) define a new measure of pain volatility and (2) predict future pain volatility levels from users of the pain management app, Manage My Pain, based on demographic, clinical, and app use features.Methods: Pain volatility was defined as the mean of absolute changes between 2 consecutive self-reported pain severity scores within the observation periods. The k-means clustering algorithm was applied to users' pain volatility scores at the first and sixth month of app use to establish a threshold discriminating low from high volatility classes. Subsequently, we extracted 130 demographic, clinical, and app usage features from the first month of app use to predict these 2 volatility classes at the sixth month of app use. Prediction models were developed using 4 methods: (1) logistic regression with ridge estimators; (2) logistic regression with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator; (3) Random Forests; and (4) Support Vector Machines. Overall prediction accuracy and accuracy for both classes were calculated to compare the performance of the prediction models. Training and testing were conducted using 5-fold cross validation. A class imbalance issue was addressed using a random subsampling of the training dataset. Users with at least five pain records in both the predictor and outcome periods (N=782 users) are included in the analysis.Results: k-means clustering algorithm was applied to pain volatility scores to establish a threshold of 1.6 to differentiate between low and high volatility classes. After validating the threshold using random subsamples, 2 classes were created: low volatility (n=611) and high volatility (n=171). In this class-imbalanced dataset, all 4 prediction models achieved 78.1% (611/782) to 79.0% (618/782) in overall accuracy. However, all models have a prediction accuracy of less than 18.7% (32/171) for the high volatility class. After addressing the class imbalance issue using random subsampling, results improved across all models for the high volatility class to greater than 59.6% (102/171). The prediction model based on Random Forests performs the best as it consistently achieves approximately 70% accuracy for both classes across 3 random subsamples.Conclusions: We propose a novel method for measuring pain volatility. Cluster analysis was applied to divide users into subsets of low and high volatility classes. These classes were then predicted at the sixth month of app use with an acceptable degree of accuracy using machine learning methods based on the features extracted from demographic, clinical, and app use information from the first month.

T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - Objective. To explore the application of machine learning algorithm in the prediction and evaluation of cesarean section, predicting the amount of blood transfusion during cesarean section and to analyze the risk factors of hypothermia during anesthesia recovery. Methods. (1)Through the hospital electronic medical record of medical system, a total of 600 parturients who underwent cesarean section in our hospital from June 2019 to December 2020 were included. The maternal age, admission time, diagnosis, and other case data were recorded. The routine method of cesarean section was intraspinal anesthesia, and general anesthesia was only used for patients' strong demand, taboo, or failure of intraspinal anesthesia. According to the standard of intraoperative bleeding, the patients were divided into two groups: the obvious bleeding group (MH group, N=154) and nonobvious hemorrhage group (NMH group, N=446). The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative indexes of parturients in the two groups were analyzed and compared. Then, the risk factors of intraoperative bleeding were screened by logistic regression analysis with the occurrence of obvious bleeding as the dependent variable and the factors in the univariate analysis as independent variables. In order to further predict intraoperative blood transfusion, the standard cases of recesarean section and variables with possible clinical significance were included in the prediction model. Logistic regression, XGB, and ANN3 machine learning algorithms were used to construct the prediction model of intraoperative blood transfusion. The area under ROC curve (AUROC), accuracy, recall rate, and F1 value were calculated and compared. (2) According to whether hypothermia occurred in the anesthesia recovery room, the patients were divided into two groups: the hypothermia group (N=244) and nonhypothermia group (N=356). The incidence of hypothermia was calculated, and the relevant clinical data were collected. On the basis of consulting the literatures, the factors probably related to hypothermia were collected and analyzed by univariate statistical analysis, and the statistically significant factors were analyzed by multifactor logistic regression analysis to screen the independent risk factors of hypothermia in anesthetic convalescent patients. Results. (1) First of all, we compared the basic data of the blood transfusion group and the nontransfusion group. The gestational age of the transfusion group was lower than that of the nontransfusion group, and the times of cesarean section and pregnancy in the transfusion group were higher than those of the non-transfusion group. Secondly, we compared the incidence of complications between the blood transfusion group and the nontransfusion group. The incidence of pregnancy complications was not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of premature rupture of membranes in the nontransfusion group was higher than that in the transfusion group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the fetal umbilical cord around neck, amniotic fluid index, and fetal heart rate before operation in the blood transfusion group, but the thickness of uterine anterior wall and the levels of Hb, PT, FIB, and TT in the blood transfusion group were lower than those in the nontransfusion group, while the number of placenta previa and the levels of PLT and APTT in the blood transfusion group were higher than those in the nontransfusion group.& nbsp;The XGB prediction model finally got the 8 most important features, in the order of importance from high to low: preoperative Hb, operation time, anterior wall thickness of the lower segment of uterus, uterine weakness, preoperative fetal heart, placenta previa, ASA grade, and uterine contractile drugs. The higher the score, the greater the impact on the model. There was a linear correlation between the 8 features (including the correlation with the target blood transfusion). The indexes with strong correlation with blood transfusion included the placenta previa, ASA grade, operation time, uterine atony, and preoperative Hb. Placenta previa, ASA grade, operation time, and uterine atony were positively correlated with blood transfusion, while preoperative Hb was negatively correlated with blood transfusion. In order to further compare the prediction ability of the three machine learning methods, all the samples are randomly divided into two parts: the first 75% training set and the last 25% test set. Then, the three models are trained again on the training set, and at this time, the model does not come into contact with the samples in any test set. After the model training, the trained model was used to predict the test set, and the real blood transfusion status was compared with the predicted value, and the F1, accuracy, recall rate, and AUROC4 indicators were checked. In terms of training samples and test samples, the AUROC of XGB was higher than that of logistic regression, and the F1, accuracy, and recall rate of XGB of ANN were also slightly higher than those of logistic regression and ANN. Therefore, the performance of XGB algorithm is slightly better than that of logistic regression and ANN. (2) According to the univariate analysis of hypothermia during the recovery period of anesthesia, there were significant differences in ASA grade, mode of anesthesia, infusion volume, blood transfusion, and operation duration between the normal body temperature group and hypothermia group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that ASA grade, anesthesia mode, infusion volume, blood transfusion, and operation duration were all risk factors of hypothermia during anesthesia recovery. Conclusion. In this study, three machine learning algorithms were used to analyze the large sample of clinical data and predict the results. It was found that five important predictive variables of blood transfusion during recesarean section were preoperative Hb, expected operation time, uterine weakness, placenta previa, and ASA grade. By comparing the three algorithms, the prediction effect of XGB may be more accurate than that of logistic regression and ANN. The model can provide accurate individual prediction for patients and has good prediction performance and has a good prospect of clinical application. Secondly, through the analysis of the risk factors of hypothermia during the recovery period of cesarean section, it is found that ASA grade, mode of anesthesia, amount of infusion, blood transfusion, and operation time are all risk factors of hypothermia during the recovery period of cesarean section. In line with this, the observation of this kind of patients should be strengthened during cesarean section.

AB  - Purpose Overnight admission following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has implications on clinical outcomes as well as cost benefit, yet there are few validated risk calculators for reliable identification of appropriate candidates. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a machine learning algorithm that can effectively identify patients requiring admission following elective anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods A retrospective review of a national surgical outcomes database was performed to identify patients who underwent elective ACL reconstruction from 2006 to 2018. Patients admitted overnight postoperatively were identified as those with length of stay of 1 or more days. Models were generated using random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), linear discriminant classifier (LDA), and adaptive boosting algorithms (AdaBoost), and an additional model was produced as a weighted ensemble of the four final algorithms. Results Overall, of the 4,709 patients included, 531 patients (11.3%) required at least one overnight stay following ACL reconstruction. The factors determined most important for identification of candidates for inpatient admission were operative time, anesthesia type, age, gender, and BMI. Smoking history, history of COPD, and history of coagulopathy were identified as less important variables. The following factors supported overnight admission: operative time > 200 min, age < 35.8 or > 53.5 years, male gender, BMI < 25 or > 31.2 kg/m(2), positive smoking history, history of COPD and the presence of preoperative coagulopathy. The ensemble model achieved the best performance based on discrimination assessed via internal validation (AUC = 0.76), calibration, and decision curve analysis. The model was integrated into a web-based open-access application able to provide both predictions and explanations. Conclusion Modifiable risk factors identified by the model such as increased BMI, operative time, anesthesia type, and comorbidities can help clinicians optimize preoperative status to prevent costs associated with unnecessary admissions. If externally validated in independent populations, this algorithm could use these inputs to guide preoperative screening and risk stratification to identify patients requiring overnight admission for observation following ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Can subjective pain be inferred from objective physiological data? Evidence from patients with sickle cell disease
T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience lifelong struggles with both chronic and acute pain, often requiring medical interventMaion. Pain can be managed with medications, but dosages must balance the goal of pain mitigation against the risks of tolerance, addiction and other adverse effects. Setting appropriate dosages requires knowledge of a patient's subjective pain, but collecting pain reports from patients can be difficult for clinicians and disruptive for patients, and is only possible when patients are awake and communicative. Here we investigate methods for estimating SCD patients' pain levels indirectly using vital signs that are routinely collected and documented in medical records. Using machine learning, we develop both sequential and non-sequential probabilistic models that can be used to infer pain levels or changes in pain from sequences of these physiological measures. We demonstrate that these models outperform null models and that objective physiological data can be used to inform estimates for subjective pain.Author summaryUnderstanding subjective human pain remains a major challenge. If objective data could be used in place of reported pain levels, it could reduce patient burdens and enable the collection of much larger data sets that could deepen our understanding of causes of pain and allow for accurate forecasting and more effective pain management. Here we apply two machine learning approaches to data from patients with sickle cell disease, who often experience debilitating pain crises. Using vital sign data routinely collected in hospital settings including respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure and amidst the real-world challenges of irregular timing, missing data, and inter-patient variation, we demonstrate that these models outperform baseline models in estimating subjective pain, distinguishing between typical and atypical pain levels, and detecting changes in pain. Once trained, these types of models could be used to improve pain estimates in real time in the absence of direct pain reports.

TI  - Prediction of Non-Home Discharge Following Total Hip Arthroplasty in Geriatric Patients
T2  - GERIATRIC ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY & REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe majority of total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients are discharged home postoperatively, however, many still require continued medical care. We aimed to identify important characteristics that predict nonhome discharge in geriatric patients undergoing THA using machine learning. We hypothesize that our analyses will identify variables associated with decreased functional status and overall health to be predictive of non-home discharge.Materials and MethodsElective, unilateral, THA patients above 65 years of age were isolated in the NSQIP database from 2018-2020. Demographic, pre-operative, and intraoperative variables were analyzed. After splitting the data into training (75%) and validation (25%) data sets, various machine learning models were used to predict non-home discharge. The model with the best area under the curve (AUC) was further assessed to identify the most important variables.ResultsIn total, 19,840 geriatric patients undergoing THA were included in the final analyses, of which 5194 (26.2%) were discharged to a non-home setting. The RF model performed the best and identified age above 78 years (OR: 1.08 [1.07, 1.09], P < .0001), as the most important variable when predicting non-home discharge in geriatric patients with THA, followed by severe American Society of Anesthesiologists grade (OR: 1.94 [1.80, 2.10], P < .0001), operation time (OR: 1.01 [1.00, 1.02], P < .0001), anemia (OR: 2.20 [1.87, 2.58], P < .0001), and general anesthesia (OR: 1.64 [1.52, 1.79], P < .0001). Each of these variables was also significant in MLR analysis. The RF model displayed good discrimination with AUC = .831.DiscussionThe RF model revealed clinically important variables for assessing discharge disposition in geriatric patients undergoing THA, with the five most important factors being older age, severe ASA grade, longer operation time, anemia, and general anesthesia.ConclusionsWith the rising emphasis on patient-centered care, incorporating models such as these may allow for preoperative risk factor mitigation and reductions in healthcare expenditure.

TI  - Development and validation of a machine-learning model for prediction of hypoxemia after extubation in intensive care units
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Extubation is the process of removing tracheal tubes so that patients maintain oxygenation while they start to breathe spontaneously. However, hypoxemia after extubation is an important issue for critical care doctors and is associated with patients' oxygenation, circulation, recovery, and incidence of postoperative complications. Accuracy and specificity of most related conventional models remain unsatisfactory. We conducted a predictive analysis based on a supervised machine-learning algorithm for the precise prediction of hypoxemia after extubation in intensive care units (ICUs). Methods: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database for patients over age 18 who underwent mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The primary outcome was hypoxemia after extubation, and it was defined as a partial pressure of oxygen <60 mmHg after extubation. Variables and individuals with missing values greater than 20% were excluded, and the remaining missing values were filled in using multiple imputation. The dataset was split into a training set (80%) and final test set (20%). All related clinical and laboratory variables were extracted, and logistics stepwise regression was performed to screen out the key features. Six different advanced machine-learning models, including logistics regression (LOG), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support-vector machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), were introduced for modelling. The best performance model in the first cross-validated dataset was further fine-tuned, and the final performance was assessed using the final test set. Results: A total of 14,777 patients were included in the study, and 1,864 of the patients' experienced hypoxemia after extubation. After training, the RF and LightGBM models were the strongest initial performers, and the area under the curve (AUC) using RF was 0.780 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.755-0.805] and using LightGBM was 0.779 (95% CI, 0.752-0.806). The final AUC using RF was 0.792 (95% CI, 0.771-0.814) and using LightGBM was 0.792 (95% CI, 0.770-0.815). Conclusions: Our machine learning models have considerable potential for predicting hypoxemia after extubation, which help to reduce ICU morbidity and mortality

TI  - Combining electromyographic and electrical impedance data sets through machine learning: A study in D2-mdx and wild-type mice
T2  - MUSCLE & NERVE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction/Aims: Needle impedance-electromyography (iEMG) assesses the active and passive electrical properties of muscles concurrently by using a novel needle with six electrodes, two for EMG and four for electrical impedance myography (EIM). Here, we assessed an approach for combining multifrequency EMG and EIM data via machine learning (ML) to discriminate D2-mdx muscular dystrophy and wild-type (WT) mouse skeletal muscle.Methods: iEMG data were obtained from quadriceps of D2-mdx mice, a muscular dystrophy model, and WT animals. EIM data were collected with the animals under deep anesthesia and EMG data collected under light anesthesia, allowing for limited spontaneous movement. Fourier transformation was performed on the EMG data to provide power spectra that were sampled across the frequency range using three different approaches. Random forest-based, nested ML was applied to the EIM and EMG data sets separately and then together to assess healthy versus disease category classification using a nested cross-validation procedure.Results: Data from 20 D2-mdx and 20 WT limbs were analyzed. EIM data fared better than EMG data in differentiating healthy from disease mice with 93.1% versus 75.6% accuracy, respectively. Combining EIM and EMG data sets yielded similar performance as EIM data alone with 92.2% accuracy.Discussion: We have demonstrated an ML-based approach for combining EIM and EMG data obtained with an iEMG needle. While EIM-EMG in combination fared no better than EIM alone with this data set, the approach used here demonstrates a novel method of combining the two techniques to characterize the full electrical properties of skeletal muscle.

TI  - Association between post-operative delirium and use of volatile anesthetics in the elderly: A real-world big data approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Study objective: Early post-operative delirium is a common perioperative complication in the post anesthesia care unit. To date it is unknown if a specific anesthetic regime can affect the incidence of delirium after surgery. Our objective was to examine the effect of volatile anesthetics on post-operative delirium.Design: Single Center Observational Study.Setting: Post Anesthesia Care Units at a German tertiary medical center. Patients: 30,075 patients receiving general anesthesia for surgery.Measurements: Delirium was assessed with the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale at the end of the recovery period. Subgroup-specific effects of volatile anesthetics on post-operative delirium were estimated using generalized-linear-model trees with inverse probability of treatment weighting. We further assessed the agespecific effect of volatiles using logistic regression models. Main results: Out of 30,075 records, 956 patients (3.2%) developed delirium in the post anesthesia care unit. On average, patients who developed delirium were older than patients without delirium. We found volatile anesthetics to increase the risk (Odds exp. (B) for delirium in the elderly 1.8-fold compared to total intravenous anesthesia. Odds increases with unplanned surgery 3.0-fold. In the very old (87 years or older), the increase in delirium is 6.2-fold. This result was confirmed with internal validation and in a logistic regression model.Conclusions: Our exploratory study indicates that early postoperative delirium is associated with the use of volatile anesthetics especially in the sub-cohort of patients aged 75 years and above. Further studies should include both volatile and intravenous anesthetics to find the ideal anesthetic in elderly patients.

AB  - Introduction Sentiment analysis, by evaluating written wording and its context, is a growing tool used in computer science that can determine the level of support expressed in a body of text using artificial intelligence methodologies. The application of sentiment analysis to biomedical literature is a growing field and offers the potential to rapidly and economically explore large amounts of published research and characterize treatment efficacy.Methods We compared the results of sentiment analysis of 115 article abstracts analyzed in a recently published meta-analysis of peripheral nerve block usage in primary hip and knee arthroplasty to the conclusions drawn by the authors of the original meta-analysis.Results A moderately positive outlook supporting the utilization of regional anesthesia for hip and knee arthroplasty was found in the 115 articles that were included for analysis, with 46% expressing positive sentiment, 35% expressing neutral sentiment, and 19% of abstracts expressing negative sentiment. This was well aligned with the conclusions reached by a previous meta-analysis of the same articles.Discussion Sentiment analysis applied to the medical literature can rapidly evaluate large collections of published data and generate an impression of overall findings that are aligned with the findings of a traditional meta-analysis.

TI  - Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury after Extracorporeal Cardiac Surgery (CSA-AKI) by Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - HEART SURGERY FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Acute renal failure after extracorporeal cardiac surgery under general anesthesia is high and unpredictable, but machine learning algorithms could change this. A feasible approach is to use machine learning models to construct models to predict acute kidney injury after extracorporeal cardiac surgery (CSA-AKI) and screen for the best predictive model. Method: From January 2014 to December 2021, 2187 patients undergoing extracorporeal cardiac surgery at the third hospital of Hebei Medical University and the first medical centre of Chinese PLA General Hospital were collected in this study. After excluding 923 patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria, a dataset of 1264 patients with 125 clinical indexes was constructed. After screening the feature variables using Least absolute shrinkage (LASSO) regression, the dataset was randomly divided into a training set (70%), test set (30%), and six machine learning algorithms, including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic regression (LRC), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), random forest classifier (RFC), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), were used in training set for predicting the CSA-AKI. The machine learning model with the best predictive performance was selected to complete external validation of the test set. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was used to interpret the model. Results: Of all 1264 patients, 372 (29.43%) patients presented with CSA-AKI. The LASSO regression eliminated 22 feature variables out of 125 before model development. Among the six prediction models, the RFC prediction model has the best prediction performance, with an Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.778 (95% CI: 0.726-0.830) in the test set and the best net benefit compared to the other tools. SHAP explained the impact of different feature variables on the predicted outcome, where the three most influential feature variables were creatinine clearance (CRC), intraoperative urine output (mL/kg/h) and age. Conclusion: We developed an RFC prediction model to predict the CSA-AKI, which has good predictive performance and can explain the factors affecting the prediction results of cases by integrating the SHAP method.

TI  - Predicting postoperative delirium after hip arthroplasty for elderly patients using machine learning
T2  - AGING CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and severe complication in elderly hip-arthroplasty patients.Aim This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model that determines essential features related to POD and predicts POD for elderly hip-arthroplasty patients.Methods The electronic record data of elderly patients who received hip-arthroplasty surgery between January 2017 and April 2021 were enrolled as the dataset. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) was administered to the patients during their perioperative period. The feature section method was employed as a filter to determine leading features. The classical machine learning algorithms were trained in cross-validation processing, and the model with the best performance was built in predicting the POD. Metrics of the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score were calculated to evaluate the predictive performance.Results 476 Arthroplasty elderly patients with general anesthesia were included in this study, and the final model combined feature selection method mutual information (MI) and linear binary classifier using logistic regression (LR) achieved an encouraging performance (AUC = 0.94, ACC = 0.88, sensitivity = 0.85, specificity = 0.90, F1-score = 0.87) on a balanced test dataset.Conclusion The model could predict POD with satisfying accuracy and reveal important features of suffering POD such as age, Cystatin C, GFR, CHE, CRP, LDH, monocyte count, history of mental illness or psychotropic drug use and intraoperative blood loss. Proper preoperative interventions for these factors could reduce the incidence of POD among elderly patients.

TI  - Prediction of postpartum hemorrhage using traditional statistical analysis and a machine learning approach.
T2  - AJOG global reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of postpartum hemorrhage risk factors by healthcare providers during pregnancy and the postpartum period may allow healthcare providers to act to prevent it. Developing a prediction model that incorporates several risk factors and accurately calculates the overall risk for postpartum hemorrhage is necessary.OBJECTIVE: This study used a traditional analytical approach and a machine learning model to predict postpartum hemorrhage.STUDY DESIGN: Women who gave birth at the Khaleej-e-Fars Hospital in Bandar Abbas, Iran, were evaluated retrospectively between January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2022. These pregnant women were divided into 2 groups, namely those who had postpartum hemorrhage and those who did not. We used 2 approaches for the analysis. At the first level, we used the traditional analysis methods. Demographic factors, maternal comorbidities, and obstetrical factors were compared between the 2 groups. A bivariate logistic regression analysis of the risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage was done to estimate the crude odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. In the second level, we used machine learning approaches to predict postpartum hemorrhage.RESULTS: Of the 8888 deliveries, we identified 163 women with recorded postpartum hemorrhage, giving a frequency of 1.8%. According to a traditional analysis, factors associated with an increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage in a bivariate logistic regression analysis were living in a rural area (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.98); primiparity (odds ratio, 3.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.90-4.75); mild to moderate anemia (odds ratio, 5.94; 95% confidence interval 2.81-8.34); severe anemia (odds ratio, 6.01; 95% confidence interval 3.89-11.09); abnormal placentation (odds ratio, 7.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.81-17.34); fetal macrosomia (odds ratio, 8.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-14.47); shoulder dystocia (odds ratio, 7.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-13.99); vacuum delivery (odds ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-5.98); cesarean delivery (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.79); and general anesthesia during cesarean delivery (odds ratio, 7.66; 95 % confidence interval, 3.11-9.36). According to machine learning analysis, the top 5 algorithms were XGBoost regression (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 99%), XGBoost classification (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 98%), LightGBM (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 94%), random forest regression (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 86%), and linear regression (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 78%). However, after considering all performance parameters, the XGBoost classification was found to be the best model to predict postpartum hemorrhage. The importance of the variables in the linear regression model, similar to traditional analysis methods, revealed that macrosomia, general anesthesia, anemia, shoulder dystocia, and abnormal placentation were considered to be weighted factors, whereas XGBoost classification considered living residency, parity, cesarean delivery, education, and induced labor to be weighted factors.CONCLUSION: Risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage can be identified using traditional statistical analysis and a machine learning model. Machine learning models were a credible approach for improving postpartum hemorrhage prediction with high accuracy. More research should be conducted to analyze appropriate variables and prepare big data to determine the best model.

TI  - Early Detection of Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction Using Perioperative Data Among Noncardiac Surgical Patients: A Machine-Learning Approach
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND:Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a condition imposing significant health care burden. Given its syndromic nature and often insidious onset, the diagnosis may not be made until clinical manifestations prompt further evaluation. Detecting HFrEF in precursor stages could allow for early initiation of treatments to modify disease progression. Granular data collected during the perioperative period may represent an underutilized method for improving the diagnosis of HFrEF. We hypothesized that patients ultimately diagnosed with HFrEF following surgery can be identified via machine-learning approaches using pre- and intraoperative data.METHODS:Perioperative data were reviewed from adult patients undergoing general anesthesia for major surgical procedures at an academic quaternary care center between 2010 and 2016. Patients with known HFrEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, preoperative critical illness, or undergoing cardiac, cardiology, or electrophysiologic procedures were excluded. Patients were classified as healthy controls or undiagnosed HFrEF. Undiagnosed HFrEF was defined as lacking a HFrEF diagnosis preoperatively but establishing a diagnosis within 730 days postoperatively. Undiagnosed HFrEF patients were adjudicated by expert clinician review, excluding cases for which HFrEF was secondary to a perioperative triggering event, or any event not associated with HFrEF natural disease progression. Machine-learning models, including L1 regularized logistic regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting were developed to detect undiagnosed HFrEF, using perioperative data including 628 preoperative and 1195 intraoperative features. Training/validation and test datasets were used with parameter tuning. Test set model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), positive predictive value, and other standard metrics.RESULTS:Among 67,697 cases analyzed, 279 (0.41%) patients had undiagnosed HFrEF. The AUROC for the logistic regression model was 0.869 (95% confidence interval, 0.829-0.911), 0.872 (0.836-0.909) for the random forest model, and 0.873 (0.833-0.913) for the extreme gradient boosting model. The corresponding positive predictive values were 1.69% (1.06%-2.32%), 1.42% (0.85%-1.98%), and 1.78% (1.15%-2.40%), respectively.CONCLUSIONS:Machine-learning models leveraging perioperative data can detect undiagnosed HFrEF with good performance. However, the low prevalence of the disease results in a low positive predictive value, and for clinically meaningful sensitivity thresholds to be actionable, confirmatory testing with high specificity (eg, echocardiography or cardiac biomarkers) would be required following model detection. Future studies are necessary to externally validate algorithm performance at additional centers and explore the feasibility of embedding algorithms into the perioperative electronic health record for clinician use in real time.

TI  - Patient-Reported Outcomes for Function and Pain in Total Knee Arthroplasty Patients
T2  - NURSING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Some patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty successfully manage their condition postoperatively, whereas others encounter challenges in regaining function and controlling pain during recovery at home. Objective The aim of this study was to use traditional statistics and machine learning to develop prediction models that identify patients likely to have increased care needs related to managing function and pain following total knee arthroplasty. Methods This study included 201 patients. Outcomes were changes between baseline and follow-up in the functional and pain subcomponents of the Oxford Knee Score. Both classification and regression modeling were applied. Twenty-one predictors were included. Tenfold cross-validation was used, and the regression models were evaluated based on root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination. Classification models were evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results In classification modeling, random forest and stochastic gradient boosting provided the best overall metrics for model performance. A support vector machine and a stochastic gradient boosting machine in regression modeling provided the best predictive performance. The models performed better in predicting challenges related to function compared to challenges related to pain. Discussion There is valuable predictive information in the data routinely collected for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. The developed models may predict patients who are likely to have enhanced care needs regarding function and pain management. Improvements are needed before the models can be implemented in routine clinical practice.

TI  - Prediction of opioid-related outcomes in a medicaid surgical population: Evidence to guide postoperative opiate therapy and monitoring
T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTreatment of surgical pain is a common reason for opioid prescriptions. Being able to predict which patients are at risk for opioid abuse, dependence, and overdose (opioid-related adverse outcomes [OR-AE]) could help physicians make safer prescription decisions. We aimed to develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict the risk of OR-AE following surgery using Medicaid data with external validation across states. MethodsFive machine learning models were developed and validated across seven US states (90-10 data split). The model output was the risk of OR-AE 6-months following surgery. The models were evaluated using standard metrics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for model comparison. We assessed calibration for the top performing model and generated bootstrap estimations for standard deviations. Decision curves were generated for the top-performing model and logistic regression. ResultsWe evaluated 96,974 surgical patients aged 15 and 64. During the 6-month period following surgery, 10,464 (10.8%) patients had an OR-AE. Outcome rates were significantly higher for patients with depression (17.5%), diabetes (13.1%) or obesity (11.1%). The random forest model achieved the best predictive performance (AUC: 0.877; F1-score: 0.57; recall: 0.69; precision:0.48). An opioid disorder diagnosis prior to surgery was the most important feature for the model, which was well calibrated and had good discrimination. ConclusionsA machine learning models to predict risk of OR-AE following surgery performed well in external validation. This work could be used to assist pain management following surgery for Medicaid beneficiaries and supports a precision medicine approach to opioid prescribing.Author summaryThe opioid epidemic continues in the United States and prescription opioids contribute to opioid-related overdose deaths. The study aimed to develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict the risk of opioid-related adverse outcomes (OR-AE) following surgery using Medicaid data with external validation across seven US states. This retrospective study of 96,974 patients presents seven machine learning models to predict opioid-related adverse outcomes (OAO) following surgery. The best predictive performance was achieved by the random forest model, with an AUC of 0.877. Patients with depression, diabetes, or obesity had higher rates of OR-AE. The model was well calibrated and had good discrimination, with an opioid disorder diagnosis prior to surgery being the most important feature. This work provides evidence that an automated risk prediction can potentially guide postoperative opiate therapy and monitoring.

AB  - Needle positioning is essential for various medical applications such as epidural anaesthesia. Physicians rely on their instincts while navigating the needle in epidural spaces. Thereby, identifying the tissue structures may be helpful to the physician as they can provide additional feedback in the needle insertion process. To this end, we propose a deep neural network that classifies the tissues from the phase and intensity data of complex OCT signals acquired at the needle tip. We investigate the performance of the deep neural network in a limited labelled dataset scenario and propose a novel contrastive pretraining strategy that learns invariant representation for phase and intensity data. We show that with 10% of the training set, our proposed pretraining strategy helps the model achieve an F1 score of 0.84 +/- 0.10 whereas the model achieves an F1 score of 0.60 +/- 0.07 without it. Further, we analyse the importance of phase and intensity individually towards tissue classification.

TI  - Demographic and Methodological Heterogeneity in Electrocardiogram Signals From Guinea Pigs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Electrocardiograms (ECG) are universally used to measure the electrical activity of the heart; however, variations in recording techniques and/or subject demographics can affect ECG interpretation. In this study, we investigated variables that are likely to influence ECG metric measurements in cardiovascular research, including recording technique, use of anesthesia, and animal model characteristics. Awake limb lead ECG recordings were collected in vivo from adult guinea pigs using a platform ECG system, while recordings in anesthetized animals were performed using both a platform and needle ECG system. We report significant heterogeneities in ECG metric values that are attributed to methodological differences (e.g., ECG lead configuration, ECG recording platform, presence or absence of anesthesia) that persist even within the same cohort of animals. Further, we report that variability in animal demographics is preserved in vivo ECG recordings-with animal age serving as a significant contributor, while sex-specific influences were less pronounced. Methodological approaches and subject demographics should be fully considered when interpreting ECG values in animal models, comparing datasets between studies, or developing artificial intelligence algorithms that utilize an ECG database.

TI  - Neurocognitive predictors of adherence to an online pain self-management program adjunct to long-term opioid therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionWhile pain self-management programs can significantly improve patient outcomes, poor adherence is common and the need for research on predictors of adherence has been noted. A potential, but commonly overlooked, predictor is cognitive function. Our aim, then, was to examine the relative influence of various cognitive functional domains on engagement with an online pain self-management program.MethodA secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial testing the impact of E-health (a 4-month subscription to the online Goalistics Chronic Pain Management Program) plus treatment as usual, relative to treatment as usual alone, on pain and opioid dose outcomes in adults receiving long-term opioid therapy of morphine equivalence dose >= 20 mg; 165 E-health participants who completed an on-line neurocognitive battery were included in this sub-analysis. A variety of demographic, clinical, and symptom rating scales were also examined. We hypothesized that better processing speed and executive functions at baseline would predict engagement with the 4-month E-health subscription.ResultsTen functional cognitive domains were identified using exploratory factor analysis and the resultant factor scores applied for hypothesis testing. The strongest predictors of E-health engagement were selective attention, and response inhibition and speed domains. An explainable machine learning algorithm improved classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.ConclusionsThe results suggest that cognition, especially selective attention, inhibitory control, and processing speed, is predictive of online chronic pain self-management program engagement. Future research to replicate and extend these findings seems warranted.ClinicalTrials.gov Registration NumberNCT03309188

TI  - Adrenal Insufficiency in Children Undergoing Heart Surgery Does Not Correlate With More Complex Postoperative Course
T2  - PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although some evidence suggests benefit of steroid supplementation after pediatric cardiac surgery, data correlating adrenal function with the postoperative course is scarce. This study sought to determine if adrenal insufficiency (AI) after cardiac surgery is associated with a more complicated postoperative course in children. A prospective study was performed during a 6-month period at a pediatric medical center. Included were 119 children, 3 months and older, who underwent heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Cortisol levels were measured before and 18 h after surgery. Patients were divided into two groups by procedure complexity (low or high), and clinical and laboratory parameters were compared between patients with and without AI within each complexity group. In the low-complexity group, 45 of the 65 patients had AI. The normal adrenal function (NAF) subgroup had greater inotropic support at 12, 24, and 36 h after surgery and a higher lactate level at 12 and 24 h after surgery. There were no significant differences between subgroups in duration of ventilation, sedation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, or urine output. In the high-complexity group, 27 patients had AI, and 27 did not. There were no significant differences between subgroups in inotropic support or urine output during the first 36 h or in mechanical ventilation, sedation, or ICU stay duration. Children with AI after heart surgery do not have a more complex postoperative course than children with NAF. The adrenal response of individual patients seems to be appropriate for their cardiovascular status.

TI  - Mechanisms of emergence from general anesthesia
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project SummaryCellular mechanisms mediating the transition from a state of general anesthesia to an awake state are notunderstood. Patients emerge from anesthesia passively without the use of mechanistically targetedinterventions, creating an unpredictable clinical outcome marked by behavioral phenomena like emergenceagitation and delirium. Many anesthetics act either directly or indirectly to change excitatory/inhibitory balancein the brain, highlighting the importance of understanding inhibitory networks in emergence. My researchprogram focuses on the effects of general anesthesia on inhibitory plasticity during the transition fromanesthetized to awake state in mice. My prior work examines neuroligin-2, a central organizer of the inhibitorysynapse, using cell-type and circuit specific manipulations. Neuroligin-2 is a cell adhesion protein that acts as ascaffold to regulate general inhibitory synaptic function and is recently implicated as an independent regulatorof intracellular signaling and disease. I demonstrated that neuroligin-2 manipulation modulates agitation andrelated behaviors in mouse models. My established expertise in stress-induced inhibitory synaptic plasticityprovides a strong foundation for the following three complementary research areas investigating generalanesthesia emergence. (1) Inhibitory cell plasticity in emergence from anesthesia: Research area 1 willfocus on effects of general anesthesia emergence on inhibitory cell plasticity, starting with an investigation ofkey inhibitory postsynaptic genes, like neuroligin-2, using targeted knockdown and electrophysiology studies.Single cell sequencing transcriptomic investigations will characterize all cell types and synaptic constituentsmodified by emergence. (2) Brain-wide cell type-specific circuit activity in emergence: Research area 2will investigate whole brain circuit changes induced by general anesthesia emergence using activity mappingand light sheet microscopy at single cell resolution, along with recordings of neuronal activity using geneticallyencoded optical sensors expressed in anesthesia-regulated circuits. (3) Preclinical models for emergencedelirium across the lifespan: Research area 3 will develop and validate preclinical rodent models ofemergence delirium using machine learning approaches, in order to study vulnerability to anesthesia-induceddelirium across the lifespan. Together, these three projects form an overarching research program tounderstand mechanisms of emergence from the inhibitory cellular to circuit to behavioral levels of analysis,providing a holistic view of emergence. We must understand the mechanisms of anesthetic emergence acrossall levels in order to design pharmaceutical interventions to bring about safer and predictable emergence.

TI  - Objective Pharyngeal Phenotyping in Obstructive Sleep Apnea With High-Resolution Manometry
T2  - OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveDrug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is a commonly used diagnostic tool for surgical procedural selection in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but it is expensive, subjective, and requires sedation. Here we present an initial investigation of high-resolution pharyngeal manometry (HRM) for upper airway phenotyping in OSA, developing a software system that reliably predicts pharyngeal sites of collapse based solely on manometric recordings. Study DesignProspective cross-sectional study. SettingAn academic sleep medicine and surgery practice. MethodsForty participants underwent simultaneous HRM and DISE. A machine learning algorithm was constructed to estimate pharyngeal level-specific severity of collapse, as determined by an expert DISE reviewer. The primary outcome metrics for each level were model accuracy and F1-score, which balances model precision against recall. ResultsDuring model training, the average F1-score across all categories was 0.86, with an average weighted accuracy of 0.91. Using a holdout test set of 9 participants, a K-nearest neighbor model trained on 31 participants attained an average F1-score of 0.96 and an average accuracy of 0.97. The F1-score for prediction of complete concentric palatal collapse was 0.86. ConclusionOur findings suggest that HRM may enable objective and dynamic mapping of the pharynx, opening new pathways toward reliable and reproducible assessment of this complex anatomy in sleep.

TI  - Circle packing charts generated by ChatGPT to identify the characteristics of articles by anesthesiology authors in 2022: Bibliometric analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background:The ChatGPT (Open AI, San Francisco, CA), denoted by the Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer, has been a hot topic for discussion over the past few months. A verification of whether the code for drawing circle packing charts (CPCs) with R can be generated by ChatGPT and used to identify characteristics of articles by anesthesiology authors is needed. This study aimed to provide insights into article characteristics in the field of anesthesiology and to highlight the potential of ChatGPT for data visualization techniques (e.g., CPCs) in bibliometric analysis.Methods:A total of 23,012 articles were indexed in PubMed in 2022 by authors in the field of anesthesiology. The code for drawing CPCs with R was generated by ChatGPT and then modified by the authors to identify the characteristics of articles in 2 forms: 23,012 and 100 top-impact factors in journals (T100IF). Using CPCs and 3 other visualizations-network charts, impact beam plots, and Sankey diagrams-we were able to display article features commonly used in bibliometric analysis. The author-weighted scheme and absolute advantage coefficient were used to assess dominant entities, such as countries, institutes, authors, and themes (defined by PubMed and MeSH terms).Results:Our findings indicate that: further modifications should be made to the code generated by ChatGPT for drawing CPCs in R; publications in the field of anesthesiology are dominated by China, followed by the United States and Japan; Capital Medical University (China) and Showa University Hospital (Japan) dominate research institutes in terms of publications and IF, respectively; and COVID-19 is the most frequently reported theme in T100IF, accounting for 29%.Conclusions:No such articles with CPCs regarding bibliometrics have ever been found in PubMed. The code for drawing CPCs with R can be generated by ChatGPT, but further modification is required for implementation in bibliometrics. CPCs should be used in future studies to identify the characteristics of articles in other areas of research rather than limiting them to anesthesiology, as we did in this study.

TI  - Gas induction for pyloromyotomy
T2  - PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInfants with pyloric stenosis are considered to be at high risk of aspiration on induction of anesthesia. Traditionally, texts have recommended classic rapid sequence induction (RSI) or awake intubation (AI). AI has generally fallen out of favor, while the components of RSI have become increasingly controversial. Infants are at high risk of hypoxemia if ventilation is not maintained while waiting for neuromuscular blockade to establish. The efficacy of cricoid pressure (CP) to prevent aspiration has not been proven. It can impair visualization of the glottis and make intubation difficult. It is debatable whether any RSI technique is needed for pyloromyotomy. A recent review of 235 infants reported no aspiration events. These children were anesthetized with a variety of techniques, including RSI, gas induction, and AI. In our institution, we teach a gaseous induction. The nasogastric tube is used to empty the stomach and anesthesia is induced with sevoflurane. A nondepolarizing muscle relaxant is administered and ventilation maintained until neuromuscular blockade is established and intubating conditions are optimal. We report our experience of this technique.MethodA retrospective medical notes review of all patients undergoing pyloromyotomy between 2005 and 2012.ResultsThere were 269 patients (84.4% male, mean weight 3.74kg0.74). Two hundred and fifty-two (93.7%) received gas inductions and 17 (6.3%) intravenous (IV) inductions. Two children received an RSI. No patient-specific factors were identified to explain operator choice in those receiving IV inductions. There were no recorded aspiration events.ConclusionGas induction can be considered for children undergoing pyloromyotomy.

TI  - Temporal irreversibility of neural dynamics as a signature of consciousness
T2  - CEREBRAL CORTEX
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissipative systems evolve in the preferred temporal direction indicated by the thermodynamic arrow of time. The fundamental nature of this temporal asymmetry led us to hypothesize its presence in the neural activity evoked by conscious perception of the physical world, and thus its covariance with the level of conscious awareness. We implemented a data-driven deep learning framework to decode the temporal inversion of electrocorticography signals acquired from non-human primates. Brain activity time series recorded during conscious wakefulness could be distinguished from their inverted counterparts with high accuracy, both using frequency and phase information. However, classification accuracy was reduced for data acquired during deep sleep and under ketamine-induced anesthesia; moreover, the predictions obtained from multiple independent neural networks were less consistent for sleep and anesthesia than for conscious wakefulness. Finally, the analysis of feature importance scores highlighted transitions between slow (approximate to 20 Hz) and fast frequencies (>40 Hz) as the main contributors to the temporal asymmetry observed during conscious wakefulness. Our results show that a preferred temporal direction is manifest in the neural activity evoked by conscious mentation and in the phenomenology of the passage of time, establishing common ground to tackle the relationship between brain and subjective experience.

TI  - A Neural Network Model Using Pain Score Patterns to Predict the Need for Outpatient Opioid Refills Following Ambulatory Surgery: Algorithm Development and Validation.
T2  - JMIR perioperative medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansion of clinical guidance tools is crucial to identify patients at risk of requiring an opioid refill after outpatient surgery.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop machine learning algorithms incorporating pain and opioid features to predict the need for outpatient opioid refills following ambulatory surgery.METHODS: Neural networks, regression, random forest, and a support vector machine were used to evaluate the data set. For each model, oversampling and undersampling techniques were implemented to balance the data set. Hyperparameter tuning based on k-fold cross-validation was performed, and feature importance was ranked based on a Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) explainer model. To assess performance, we calculated the average area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity for each model.RESULTS: There were 1333 patients, of whom 144 (10.8%) refilled their opioid prescription within 2 weeks after outpatient surgery. The average AUC calculated from k-fold cross-validation was 0.71 for the neural network model. When the model was validated on the test set, the AUC was 0.75. The features with the highest impact on model output were performance of a regional nerve block, postanesthesia care unit maximum pain score, postanesthesia care unit median pain score, active smoking history, and total perioperative opioid consumption.CONCLUSIONS: Applying machine learning algorithms allows providers to better predict outcomes that require specialized health care resources such as transitional pain clinics. This model can aid as a clinical decision support for early identification of at-risk patients who may benefit from transitional pain clinic care perioperatively in ambulatory surgery.

TI  - Dental caries treatment completed under general anesthesia among American Indian children in a northern plains tribal community
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH DENTISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To assess the occurrence of treatment under general anesthesia (GA) for dental caries among American Indian (AI) children from a Northern Plains tribal community.Methods As part of a follow-up study of ECC, dental records for children age 6-8 years were evaluated. Descriptive statistics were generated, including the number of dental visits, extent of treatment, and whether the treatment was completed under GA.Results Data were obtained from 95 dental records. The age of dental visits varied from 15 months to 8 years. Of the 95 children, 79 (83.2%) received dental treatment under GA at least once; 24 (25.2%) did so two or more times. The majority of the treatment involved extractions and placement of stainless steel crowns.Conclusions A large number of AI children received dental treatment under GA; many did so multiple times. Given the high cost of this treatment, even modestly effective preventive strategies such as silver diamine fluoride could yield cost savings.

T2  - ANAESTHESIOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Individualized medicine uses data on biological characteristics of individual patients in order to tailor treatment planning to their unique constitution. With respect to the practice of anesthesiology and intensive care medicine, it bears the potential to systematize the often complex medical care of critically ill patients and to improve outcomes.Objective: The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the possible applications of the principles of individualized medicine in anesthesiology and intensive care medicine.Material and methods: Based on a search in MEDLINE, CENTRAL and Google Scholar, the results of previous studies and systematic reviews are narratively synthesized and the implications for the scientific and clinical practice are presented.Results and discussion: There are possibilities for individualization and an increase in precision of patient care in most if not all problems in anesthesiology and symptoms in intensive medical care. Even now, all practicing physicians can initiate measures to individualize treatment at different timepoints throughout the course of treatment. Individualized medicine can supplement and be integrated into protocols. Plans for future applications of individualized medicine interventions should consider the feasibility in a real-world setting. Clinical studies should contain process evaluations in order to create ideal preconditions for a successful implementation. Quality management, audits and feedback should become a standard procedure to ensure sustainability. In the long run, individualization of care, especially in the critically ill, should be enshrined in guidelines and become an integral part of clinical practice.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - An ideal that supports quality and delivery of care is to have hospital operations that are coordinated and optimized across all services in real time. As a step toward this goal, we propose a multistage adaptive robust optimization approach combined with machine learning techniques. Informed by data and predictions, our framework unifies the bed assignment process across the entire hospital and accounts for present and future inpatient flows, discharges, and bed requests from the emergency department, scheduled surgeries and admissions, and outside transfers. We evaluate our approach through simulations calibrated on historical data from a large academic medical center. For the 600 bed institution, our optimization model was solved in seconds and reduced off-service placement by 24% on average and boarding delays in the emergency department and post anesthesia units by 35% and 18%, respectively. We also illustrate the benefit of using adaptive linear decision rules instead of static assignment decisions.

TI  - Impact of carbon dioxide insufflation and water exchange on postcolonoscopy outcomes in patients receiving on-demand sedation: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims: Water exchange (WE) is the least painful insertion method during colonoscopy. Its impact on postcolonoscopy discomfort has not been well-described. Carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation consistently reduced postcolonoscopy discomfort. We compared postcolonoscopy outcomes of various combinations of insertion and withdrawal techniques (insertion-withdrawal modality): WE-CO2, WE-air insufflation (WE-AI), andCO(2)-CO2.Methods: A total of 240 patients undergoing on-demand sedation diagnostic colonoscopy were randomized to WE-CO2 (n = 79), WE-AI (n = 80), CO2-CO2 (n = 81), with postprocedural data collected up to 24 hours. The primary outcome was postcolonoscopy bloating. Other postcolonoscopy outcomes included pain scores, flatus and incontinence episodes, toilet use, interference with normal activities, patient satisfaction, and patient willingness to repeat the procedure.Results: Demographic and procedural data were comparable. Compared with WE-AI, WE-CO2 and CO2-CO2 resulted in significantly less bloating (all P < .0005) and lower pain scores (P values ranged from .008 to < .0005) up to 3 hours and fewer flatus episodes up to 6 hours (P values ranged from .003 to < .0005). WE-CO2 resulted in less interference with same-day activities compared with WE-AI (P = .043). The differences in postprocedural outcomes were significant, but the magnitude was small. Patient satisfaction and willingness to repeat the procedure were high and comparable among groups. WE was the least painful insertion technique (P < .0005).Conclusions: The combination WE-CO2 appears to be the optimal choice to decrease pain during the examination and to reduce bloating and other undesired procedural outcomes afterward. If a CO2 insufflator is already available, it seems advisable to adopt the combination WE-CO2. In the absence of a CO2 insufflator, the cost effectiveness of the addition of withdrawal CO2 to WE in diagnostic and nondiagnostic settings needs to be critically assessed.

TI  - PHARMACOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF <i>AESCULUS INDICA</i> AQUEOUS-ETHANOL EXTRACT FOR ITS ANTI-NOCICEPTIVE ACTION
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aesculus indica is used in traditional medicine for various health problems, including rheumatic pain. The present research project was aimed to investigate the analgesic effect of Aesculus indica, in order to substantiate its therapeutic use in rheumatism. Aesculus indica crude extract (Ai. Cr) was investigated, using chemical and thermally induced nociceptive models in mice. Ai. Cr showed the presence of carbohydrates, flavonoids, proteins, saponins, steroids, tannins and terpenes. In chemical-induced nociception, Ai. Cr dose dependently (10, 30 and 60 mg/Kg) inhibits acetic acid evoked writhes as exhibited by diclofenac sodium. In thermally-induced nociceptive models Ai. Cr at 100, 300 and 600 mg/Kg prolonged the latency period, measured at different time intervals of 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. both in hot plate and tail immersion test, similar to tramadol. These results proposed that Aesculus indica possesses anti-nociceptive property, occurred possibly through dual inhibition of peripheral (chemically) and central (thermally) nociception mechanisms, which provides scientific background in support of its folk use in pain management.

TI  - Association between Etomidate Use for Rapid Sequence Intubation and Adrenal Insufficiency in Sepsis
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The risk of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in using single-dose etomidate for intubation among patients with sepsis remains controversial. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of AI and characterize the risk factors in patients who received etomidate for rapid sequence intubation (RSI).Methods This is a retrospective study of prospectively-acquired data evaluating surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients who developed respiratory failure undergoing RSI.Results Of the 44 adult SICU patients who developed respiratory failure, 34 patients received etomidate. The average age for the total cohort, for the patients that received etomidate and for those who did not, was 70.91 +/- 14.92, 72.82 +/- 13.61 years and 64.40 +/- 15.93, respectively. Twenty-four patients of the total cohort (54.55%) developed AI; 26 had septic shock (59.09%), and 16 patients had AI and septic shock (36.36%). There was no statistical significance between the incidence of AI in patients who received etomidate (47%) and those who did not (80%). However, in the subset of patients who received etomidate for RSI, there was a nonsignificant trend toward increased incidence of AI in those who were septic compared to those who were not (p = 0.06).Conclusion A single dose of etomidate used for RSI in SICU patients is not associated with the development of AI or mortality. However, a trend was shown, although not statistically significant, towards the development of AI in septic patients. High-quality and adequately powered randomized control trials (RCTs) are warranted.

T2  - MEDICAL IMAGING 2018: COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS
M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - We are developing a decision support system for assisting clinicians in assessment of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for bladder cancer. Accurate treatment response assessment is crucial for identifying responders and improving quality of life for non-responders. An objective machine learning decision support system may help reduce variability and inaccuracy in treatment response assessment. We developed a predictive model to assess the likelihood that a patient will respond based on image and clinical features. With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected a data set of pre- and post-treatment CT scans along with clinical information from surgical pathology from 98 patients. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier was used to predict the likelihood that a patient would respond to treatment based on radiomic features extracted from CT urography (CTU), a radiologist's semantic feature, and a clinical feature extracted from surgical and pathology reports. The classification accuracy was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC) with a leave-one-case-out cross validation. The classification accuracy was compared for the systems based on radiomic features, clinical feature, and radiologist's semantic feature. For the system based on only radiomic features the AUC was 0.75. With the addition of clinical information from examination under anesthesia (EUA) the AUC was improved to 0.78. Our study demonstrated the potential of designing a decision support system to assist in treatment response assessment. The combination of clinical features, radiologist semantic features and CTU radiomic features improved the performance of the classifier and the accuracy of treatment response assessment.

TI  - Burnout in Italian anesthesiologists and intensivists during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national survey
T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic added additional burden upon healthcare systems and anesthesiology and inten-sive care physicians (AI) who possessed crucial expertise for dealing with the pandemic. Aim of the study was to uncover specific burnout patterns among Italian AI, exploring the hypothesis that burnout has a multicluster structure. Differences in social and professional characteristics between burnout patterns were explored.METHODS: One thousand and nine AI (658 women) members of the Societa Italiana di Anestesia Analgesia Rianima-zione e Terapia Intensiva (SIAARTI) working during COVID-19 pandemic participated. Sociodemographic, working information and burnout levels evaluated through Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) were collected. RESULTS: According to the MBI cutoff, 39.7% and 25.8% of participants scored high in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization respectively, and 44.2% scored low in personal accomplishment. Cluster analysis highlighted four burnout profiles: resilience, detachment, burnout, and emotional reserve. The results showed that AI in the Resilience and Emotional Reserve groups were significantly older and more experienced than those in the Detachment and Burnout groups. Additionally, more of the individuals in the Resilience group were working in intensive care units and depart-ments dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The Detachment group was comprised of more AI working in operating units, while the Burnout group contained a higher number of AI working in COVID-19 departments.CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight different burnout patterns in Italian AI: older age, more professional experi-ence, and work in intensive care units and departments dedicated to COVID-19 seemed to be protective factors during the pandemic. This appears a first step to promote focused interventions.

TI  - Integrating machine learning predictions for perioperative risk management: Towards an empirical design of a flexible-standardized risk assessment tool
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Surgical patients are complex, vulnerable, and prone to postoperative complications that can potentially be mitigated with quality perioperative risk assessment and management. Several institutions have incorporated machine learning (ML) into their patient care to improve awareness and support clinician decisionmaking along the perioperative spectrum. Recent research suggests that ML risk prediction can support perioperative patient risk monitoring and management across several situations, including the operating room (OR) to intensive care unit (ICU) handoffs.Objectives: Our study objectives were threefold: (1) evaluate whether ML-generated postoperative predictions are concordant with clinician-generated risk rankings for acute kidney injury, delirium, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism, and establish their associated risk factors; (2) ascertain clinician end-user suggestions to improve adoption of ML-generated risks and their integration into the perioperative workflow; and (3) develop a user-friendly visualization format for a tool to display ML-generated risks and risk factors to support postoperative care planning, for example, within the context of OR-ICU handoffs.Methods: Graphical user interfaces for postoperative risk prediction models were assessed for end-user usability through cognitive walkthroughs and interviews with anesthesiologists, surgeons, certified registered nurse anesthetists, registered nurses, and critical care physicians. Thematic analysis relying on an explanation design framework was used to identify feedback and suggestions for improvement.Results: 17 clinicians participated in the evaluation. ML estimates of complication risks aligned with clinicians' independent rankings, and related displays were perceived as valuable for decision-making and care planning for postoperative care. During OR-ICU handoffs, the tool could speed up report preparation and remind clinicians to address patient-specific complications, thus providing more tailored care information. Suggestions for improvement centered on electronic tool delivery; methods to build trust in ML models; modifiable risks and risk mitigation strategies; and additional patient information based on individual preferences (e.g., surgical procedure).Conclusions: ML estimates of postoperative complication risks can provide anticipatory guidance, potentially increasing the efficiency of care planning. We have offered an ML visualization framework for designing future ML-augmented tools and anticipate the development of tools that recommend specific actions to the user based on ML model output.

TI  - Impact of wrist-ankle acupuncture on propofol dosage under the dual monitoring of density spectrum array and anesthesia consciousness index in elderly patients undergoing urologic surgery: a sham-controlled randomized clinical trial
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL ANDROLOGY AND UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Propofol is a widely used intravenous anesthetic in clinic. However, it is easy to cause serious circulatory fluctuation in elderly patients, so the dose should be reduced as appropriate. Studies have shown that wrist-ankle acupuncture (WAA) can reduce the dosage of propofol in patients undergoing painless endoscopy. Unfortunately, there is no report on whether WAA will reduce the dosage of propofol when used for anesthesia in elderly patients. The purpose of this study is to observe the effect of WAA on propofol dosage in elderly patients, and to provide a new method for maintaining circulatory stability in elderly patients under general anesthesia.Methods: From October 2022 to December 2022, Hebei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine was selected. Forty-four elderly patients undergoing general anesthesia in urology department were randomly divided into two groups according to the complete random method with WAA group, consisting of 22 individuals, and non-WAA (NWAA) group, also consisting of 22 individuals. Both groups were treated with WAA or false needle acupuncture at the same site before anesthesia, respectively, and the needle was kept until the operation was finished. During the operation, the dosage of propofol was adjusted according to the depth of field monitoring density spectrum array (DSA) and anesthesia consciousness index (Ai) with anesthesia monitor.Results: A total of 44 patients participated in this study, and all of them completed the experiment. There were no significant difference in sex, age, height, weight, duration of anesthesia, liver and kidney function, score of Fried frailty scale, activity of daily living (ADL), age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (aCCI) and mini-cognitive test (Mini-Cog) between the two groups (P>0.05), but the total dose of propofol (WAA =121.5, NWAA =170.5) mg and maintenance dose (WAA =1.02 +/- 0.55, NWAA =1.76 +/- 0.67) mg/kg/h, utilization rate of vasoactive drugs during operation, recovery time after anesthesia (WAA =2, NWAA =3) min and surgeon satisfaction (WAA =9, NWAA =8.5) had significant differences (P<0.05).Conclusions: Compared with NWAA group, WAA group could reduce the dosage of propofol in anesthesia for elderly patients with exocrine secretion and was beneficial to circulatory stability.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ID: ChiCTR2100054132).

TI  - Evaluation of machine learning models as decision aids for anesthesiologists
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine Learning (ML) models have been developed to predict perioperative clinical parameters. The objective of this study was to determine if ML models can serve as decision aids to improve anesthesiologists' prediction of peak intraoperative glucose values and postoperative opioid requirements. A web-based tool was used to present actual surgical case and patient information to 10 practicing anesthesiologists. They were asked to predict peak glucose levels and post-operative opioid requirements for 100 surgical patients with and without presenting ML model estimations of peak glucose and opioid requirements. The accuracies of the anesthesiologists' estimates with and without ML estimates as reference were compared. A questionnaire was also sent to the participating anesthesiologists to obtain their feedback on ML decision support. The accuracy of peak glucose level estimates by the anesthesiologists increased from 79.0 +/- 13.7% without ML assistance to 84.7 +/- 11.5% (< 0.001) when ML estimates were provided as reference. The accuracy of opioid requirement estimates increased from 18% without ML assistance to 42% (p < 0.001) when ML estimates were provided as reference. When ML estimates were provided, predictions of peak glucose improved for 8 out of the 10 anesthesiologists, while predictions of opioid requirements improved for 7 of the 10 anesthesiologists. Feedback questionnaire responses revealed that the anesthesiologist primarily used the ML estimates as reference to modify their clinical judgement. ML models can improve anesthesiologists' estimation of clinical parameters. ML predictions primarily served as reference information that modified an anesthesiologist's clinical estimate.

TI  - Machine learning clinical decision support for interdisciplinary multimodal chronic musculoskeletal pain treatment
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PAIN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionChronic musculoskeletal pain is a prevalent condition impacting around 20% of people globally; resulting in patients living with pain, fatigue, restricted social and employment capacity, and reduced quality of life. Interdisciplinary multimodal pain treatment programs have been shown to provide positive outcomes by supporting patients modify their behavior and improve pain management through focusing attention on specific patient valued goals rather than fighting pain.MethodsGiven the complex nature of chronic pain there is no single clinical measure to assess outcomes from multimodal pain programs. Using Centre for Integral Rehabilitation data from 2019-2021 (n = 2,364), we developed a multidimensional machine learning framework of 13 outcome measures across 5 clinically relevant domains including activity/disability, pain, fatigue, coping and quality of life. Machine learning models for each endpoint were separately trained using the most important 30 of 55 demographic and baseline variables based on minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection. Five-fold cross validation identified best performing algorithms which were rerun on deidentified source data to verify prognostic accuracy.ResultsIndividual algorithm performance ranged from 0.49 to 0.65 AUC reflecting characteristic outcome variation across patients, and unbalanced training data with high positive proportions of up to 86% for some measures. As expected, no single outcome provided a reliable indicator, however the complete set of algorithms established a stratified prognostic patient profile. Patient level validation achieved consistent prognostic assessment of outcomes for 75.3% of the study group (n = 1,953). Clinician review of a sample of predicted negative patients (n = 81) independently confirmed algorithm accuracy and suggests the prognostic profile is potentially valuable for patient selection and goal setting.DiscussionThese results indicate that although no single algorithm was individually conclusive, the complete stratified profile consistently identified patient outcomes. Our predictive profile provides promising positive contribution for clinicians and patients to assist with personalized assessment and goal setting, program engagement and improved patient outcomes.

TI  - Construction and validation of Intraoperative Hypothermia risk prediction model in lung cancer patients
T2  - Chinese Nursing Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To construct and validate the risk prediction model of Intraoperative Hypothermia in lung cancer patients, and to provide a reference for clinical medical staff to identify the high-risk groups of Intraoperative Hypothermia in lung cancer patients. Methods: Patients with lung cancer from June to November 2022 in a tertiary grade A cancer hospital in Sichuan province were randomly divided into training set (770 cases) and validation set (330 cases). Four machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest, support vector machine) in Recovery Component were used to construct prediction models, and their performance was compared to obtain the best prediction model algorithm for Intraoperative Hypothermia in lung cancer patients. The model was verified in the validation set. Results: The incidence of Intraoperative Hypothermia was 53.2%. Intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative infusion volume, operation time, anesthesia time, operating room temperature, core body temperature after anesthesia and surgical resection site were the influencing factors of Intraoperative Hypothermia in patients with lung cancer. The AUC of the random forest model in the training set was 0.968, and the AUC of the validation set was 0.968, which was better than the other three prediction models. Conclusion: The model based on random forest algorithm is the optimal Intraoperative Hypothermia prediction model for lung cancer patients, which is conducive to clinical screening of high-risk groups, can provide reference for medical staff to take targeted preventive measures early.

TI  - A machine-learned knowledge discovery method for associating complex phenotypes with complex genotypes. Application to pain
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The association of genotyping information with common traits is not satisfactorily solved. One of the most complex traits is pain and association studies have failed so far to provide reproducible predictions of pain phenotypes from genotypes in the general population despite a well-established genetic basis of pain. We therefore aimed at developing a method able to prospectively and highly accurately predict pain phenotype from the underlying genotype.Methods: Complex phenotypes and genotypes were obtained from experimental pain data including four different pain stimuli and genotypes with respect to 30 reportedly pain relevant variants in 10 genes. The training data set was obtained in 125 healthy volunteers and the independent prospective test data set was obtained in 89 subjects. The approach involved supervised machine learning.Results: The phenotype-genotype association was reached in three major steps. First, the pain phenotype data was projected and clustered by means of emergent self-organizing map (ESOM) analysis and subsequent U-matrix visualization. Second, pain sub-phenotypes were identified by interpreting the cluster structure using classification and regression tree classifiers. Third, a supervised machine learning algorithm (Unweighted Label Rule generation) was applied to genetic markers reportedly modulating pain to obtain a complex genotype underlying the identified subgroups of subjects with homogenous pain response. This procedure correctly identified 80% of the subjects as belonging to an extreme pain phenotype in an independently and prospectively assessed cohort.Conclusion: The developed methodology is a suitable basis for complex genotype-phenotype associations in pain. It may provide personalized treatments of complex traits. Due to its generality, this new method should also be applicable to other association tasks except pain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - What influences aromatase inhibitor continuation intention among breast cancer survivors?
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF WOMEN HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are widely prescribed for postmenopausal women with breast cancer and are known to cause musculoskeletal pain. This study aimed to identify factors associated with AI continuation intention among breast cancer survivors (BCS).Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 123 BCS (stages I-III), who had been taking AIs for at least 6 weeks. Participants were recruited from a cancer center in Goyang, Korea, from September to November 2019. Descriptive statistics, Welch analysis of variance, Pearson correlation coefficients, and simple linear regression were used for the analysis.Results: Beliefs about endocrine therapy was a significant predictor of AI continuation intention (beta=.66, p<.001). The majority of participants (87.0%) reported experiencing musculoskeletal pain since taking AIs and the score for the worst pain severity within 24 hours was 5.08 +/- 2.80 out of 10. Musculoskeletal pain, however, was not associated with AI continuation intention. Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) was clinically significant (>= 13) for 74.0% of the respondents (mean, 17.62 +/- 7.14). Musculoskeletal pain severity and pain interference were significantly associated with FCR (r=.21, p<.05; r=.35, p<.01, respectively). Pain interference was significantly associated with beliefs about endocrine therapy (r=-.18, p<.05).Conclusion: AI continuation intention can be modified by reinforcing patients' beliefs about endocrine therapy. Musculoskeletal pain may have a negative effect on beliefs about endocrine therapy and increase FCR among BCS. Thus, awareness of musculoskeletal pain during Al therapy should be raised and further research is required to develop multidisciplinary pain management strategies and clinical guidelines to reinforce beliefs about endocrine therapy.

TI  - A comparison of the effects of carbon dioxide and medical air for abdominal insufflation on respiratory parameters in xylazine-sedated sheep undergoing laparoscopic artificial insemination
T2  - NEW ZEALAND VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - AIMS: To determine if abdominal insufflation with medical air will improve oxygenation and ventilation parameters when compared to insufflation with CO2 in xylazine-sedated sheep undergoing laparoscopic artificial insemination (AI).METHODS: Forty-seven sheep underwent oestrus synchronisation and were fasted for 24 hours prior to laparoscopic AI. Each animal was randomised to receive either CO2 or medical air for abdominal insufflation. An auricular arterial catheter was placed and utilised for serial blood sampling. Respiratory rates (RR) and arterial blood samples were collected at baseline, after xylazine (0.1mg/kg I/V) sedation, 2 minutes after Trendelenburg positioning, 5 minutes after abdominal insufflation, and 10 minutes after being returned to a standing position. Blood samples were collected in heparinised syringes, stored on ice, and analysed for arterial pH, partial pressure of arterial O-2 (PaO2), and CO2 (PaCO2). The number of ewes conceiving to AI was also determined.RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated temporal effects on RR, PaO2, PaCO2 and arterial pH during the laparoscopic AI procedure (p<0.001), but no difference between insufflation groups (p>0.01). No sheep experienced hypercapnia (PaCO2>50mmHg) or acidaemia (pH<7.35). Hypoxaemia (PaO2<70mmHg) was diagnosed during the procedure in 14/22 (64%) ewes in the CO2 group compared with 8/23 (35%) ewes in the medical air group (p=0.053). Overall, 15/20 (75%) ewes in the CO2 group conceived to AI compared with 16/22 (72.7%) in the medical air group (p=0.867).CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There were no statistical or clinical differences in RR, PaO2, PaCO2, pH, or conception to AI when comparing the effects of CO2 and medical air as abdominal insufflation gases. None of the sheep experienced hypercapnia or acidaemic, yet 42% (19/45) of sheep developed clinical hypoxaemia, with a higher percentage of ewes in the CO2 group developing hypoxaemia than in the medical air group. Based on the overall analysis, medical air could be utilised as a comparable alternative for abdominal insufflation during laparoscopic AI procedures.

TI  - Needs and Attitudes of Older Chronic Back Pain Patients towards a Wearable for Ultrasound Biofeedback during Stabilization Exercises: A Qualitative Analysis.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Chronic back pain has a high prevalence, especially in older adults, and seriously affects sufferers' quality of life. Segmental stabilization exercise (SSE) is often used during physiotherapy to enhance core stability. The execution of SSE requires the selective contraction of deep abdominal and back muscles. Motor learning can be supported using ultrasound imaging as visual biofeedback. ULTRAWEAR is a mobile ultrasound system that provides deep learning-based biofeedback on SSE execution, which is currently under development. We interviewed 15 older chronic back pain patients (CBPPs) to investigate their pain management behavior, experience with SSE, as well as their needs and requirements for ULTRAWEAR. We also gathered information about future-usage scenarios. CBPPs reported a high willingness to use the system as a feedback tool both in physiotherapeutic practices and at home. The automated detection and evaluation of muscle contraction states was highlighted as a major benefit of the system compared to the more subjective feedback provided by traditional methods such as palpation. The system to be developed was perceived as a helpful solution to support learning about SSE.

TI  - SBIR Phase I:  Objective Assessment of Agitation and Sedation
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is will investigate the feasibility of developing an objective agitation and sedation assessment algorithm for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Use of machine learning to identify clinically relevant information to characterize the agitation and sedation state of the patients is investigated. Furthermore, a plan to ?calibrate? and validate the agitation and sedation score provided by the algorithm will be designed. Agitation and sedation assessment is a challenging problem for patients undergoing critical care. Agitation, which is primarily characterized by excessive gross motor movement, is experienced by 74% of adults during ICU stay. Agitated patients may do physical harm to themselves by dislodging vital life support and monitoring devices with excessive musculoskeletal activity. Oversedation increases risk to the patient since liberation from mechanical ventilation may not be possible due to a diminished level of consciousness and respiratory depression from sedative. Currently, the assessment is performed by the clinical staff and no technology exists for such assessment. It is anticipated that through this research, novel algorithms for reliable detection of a patient?s agitation and sedation state using their physiological signals will be developed.<br/><br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes reduction in clinical staff workload and healthcare costs. Current clinical practice in patient critical care requires the nursing staff to assess the patient's agitation and sedation state and provide sedatives to ameliorate the patient's agitation. The process relies on subjective assessments and may result in oversedation, which in turn increases the number of interventions, length of mechanical ventilation, and duration of stay in the ICU, and hence, increases healthcare costs. Development of an objective agitation and sedation assessment system can have a great impact on the quality of care in a critical care setting. Such a system can enable continuous patient monitoring and increase quality of care. Currently, clinical staff need to attend to multiple patients and continuous monitoring of patients is not feasible. In addition, in the absence of an automated agitation and sedation assessment algorithm, early indications of undersedation or oversedation can be overlooked due to the complex nature of the patient critical care problem and clinical staff's workload.

TI  - Cannabis use is associated with a small increase in the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting: a retrospective machine-learning causal analysis
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Cannabis legalization may contribute to an increased frequency of chronic use among patients presenting for surgery. At present, it is unknown whether chronic cannabis use modifies the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Methods This study was a retrospective cohort study conducted at 2 academic medical centers. Twenty-seven thousand three hundred eighty-eight adult ASA 1-3 patients having general anesthesia for non-obstetric, non-cardiac procedures and receiving postoperative care in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) were analyzed in the main dataset, and 16,245 patients in the external validation dataset. The main predictor was patient reported use of cannabis in any form collected during pre-anesthesia evaluation and recorded in the chart. The primary outcome was documented PONV of any severity prior to PACU discharge, including administration of rescue medications in PACU. Relevant clinical covariates (risk factors for PONV, surgical characteristics, administered prophylactic antiemetic drugs) were also recorded. Results 10.0% of patients in the analytic dataset endorsed chronic cannabis use. Using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), we estimated that the relative risk for PONV associated with daily cannabis use was 1.19 (95 CI% 1.00-1.45). The absolute marginal increase in risk of PONV associated with daily cannabis use was 3.3% (95% CI 0.4-6.4%). We observed a lesser association between current, non-daily use of cannabis (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94-1.21). An internal validation analysis conducted using propensity score adjustment and Bayesian logistic modeling indicated a similar size and magnitude of the association between cannabis use and PONV (OR 1.15, 90% CI 0.98-1.33). As an external validation, we used data from another hospital in our care system to create an independent model that demonstrated essentially identical associations between cannabis use and PONV. Conclusions Cannabis use is associated with an increased relative risk and a small increase in the marginal probability of PONV.

TI  - Water Exchange Is the Least Painful Colonoscope Insertion Technique and Increases Completion of Unsedated Colonoscopy
T2  - CLINICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Unsedated colonoscopy is acceptable for diagnostic, surveillance, and screening indications worldwide. However, insertion of the colonoscope can be painful; it is not clear which technique is least painful and thereby increases the likelihood of colonoscopy completion. We performed a head-to-head comparison of air insufflation (AI), carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation, water immersion (WI), and water exchange (WE) to determine which combination of insertion techniques produces the least amount of pain.METHODS: In a patient-blinded prospective trial, 624 subjects were assigned randomly to groups that underwent colonoscopy with AI-AI, CO2-CO2, WI-AI, WE-AI, WI-CO2, or WE-CO2 insertion and withdrawal techniques, including on-demand sedation, at the St. Barbara Hospital (Iglesias, Italy) or the Vitkovice Hospital (Ostrava, Czech Republic), from October 2013 through June 2014. The primary outcome was real-time maximum insertion pain (0 = none, 10 = worst), recorded by an unblinded nurse assistant. At discharge, a blinded observer recorded the recalled maximum insertion pain and patients' and investigators' guesses about method or gas used.RESULTS: Patients and investigators correctly guessed the method used for fewer than 44% of procedures, confirming adequate blinding. The correlation between real-time and recalled maximum insertion pain (r = 0.9; P < .0005) confirmed internal validation of the primary outcome. The WE group had the lowest scores: mean pain values were 5.2 for AI-AI (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6-5.8), 4.9 for CO2-CO2 (95% CI, 4.3-5.4), 4.3 for WI-CO2 (95% CI, 3.8-4.9), 4.0 for WI-AI (95% CI, 3.5-4.5), 3.1 for WE-CO2 (95% CI, 2.7-3.4), and 3.1 for WE-AI (95% CI, 2.7-3.6) (P < .0005). The highest proportions of patients completing unsedated colonoscopy were in the WE groups. WE groups also had significantly better colon cleanliness, particularly in the transverse and right colon (P < .0005). One limitation of the study was that colonoscopists and assistants were not blinded to water-aided insertion methods.CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study of colonoscopy insertion methods, CO2 insufflation did not reduce real-time maximum insertion pain. Compared with AI or CO2, WI and WE reduced insertion pain. The least painful technique was WE, which significantly increased completion of unsedated colonoscopy and bowel cleanliness without prolonging insertion time.

TI  - Development of selective calpain-1 inhibitors for chronic pain
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARYNever in the history of the United States has the unmet medical need to develop novel, non-opioidtherapeutics for chronic pain been more urgent than it is today. More than 65 million US adults suffer fromchronic pain, resulting in almost $635 billion in annual healthcare costs. Despite their limited efficacy, andpotential for addiction, tolerance, and impaired motor performance, opioids have become a mainstay forchronic pain management, resulting in an opioid epidemic that is ravaging communities throughout the US.Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel, non-opioid therapies for chronic pain management. Thisapplication addresses this unmet medical need by leveraging our novel artificial intelligence (AI)-drivendrug discovery platform to develop selective inhibitors of calpain-1 as novel non-opioid therapeutics forchronic pain. Studies in chronic neuropathic pain animal models have shown that nerve injury overactivatescalpain-1, which downregulates K+ Cl- cotransporter activity, resulting in diminished synaptic inhibitionand neuropathic pain. Prior work by our group has also shown that both pharmacological inhibition andwhole body genetic knockout of calpain-1 attenuates chronic pain behaviors in mouse models of sickle celldisease (SCD). Importantly, the analgesic effect of calpain-1 inhibition did not induce tolerance side effects,suggesting the potential for calpain-1 inhibitors to be non-addictive. By applying our innovative artificialintelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery platform to screen a virtual chemical library, we identified four (4)novel calpain-1 inhibitors, and validated them for efficacy in biochemical assays. Here, we propose toprogress our most potent hit compound to a lead compound that is calpain-1 selective, cysteine proteasefamily selective, non-opioid, and CNS penetrant with efficacy demonstrated in at least 1 of 3 chronic painanimal models tested, including chronic sickle cell disease pain, chronic inflammatory pain, and chronicneuropathic pain. Three aims are proposed, including Aim 1: Synthesize ~100 analogs of our most potenthit compound, and characterize in vitro activity and selectivity. Success criteria: Top 20 cell-permeable,calpain-1 inhibitors, moderately selective against calpain-2, and highly selective against cathepsins andcaspase-1, Aim 2: Evaluate ADME-Tox and PK profile of our top 20 calpain-1 inhibitors from Aim 1.Success criteria: Top 2 CNS-penetrant selective calpain-1 inhibitors with favorable in vivo PK profile, andAim 3: Determine the efficacy and PK/PD relationship of our top calpain-1 inhibitor in 3 chronic painanimal models. Success: at least 40% reduction in mechanical hyperalgesia in at least 1 of the 3 chronicpain animal models tested. Successful completion of this Phase I will yield a novel CNS-penetrant, selectivecalpain-1inhibitor with efficacy demonstrated in at least 1 chronic pain animal model. Our overall productwould be the first, oral, CNS acting, selective calpain-1 inhibitor for chronic pain. Importantly, our productwould reduce opioid usage in chronic pain patients, and help to stem the US opioid epidemic.

TI  - Identification of Ketamine-addicted Animal Models Based on Radial Basis Function Network
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ketamine is a general anesthetic given intravenously in clinic, mainly used for surgical anesthesia, anesthesia induction and clinical anesthesia for diagnostic tests. Ketamine is also abused as a recreational drug because of its analgesic effect, hallucinogenic effect and addictive quality. It has emerged as an increasingly popular drug among young drug abusers worldwide, and its consumption is on the rise. A total of 29 rats were used in our study, ketamine abuse group (n = 15) and control group (n = 14). Our study to detect the changes in brain tissue of rats in two group by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and got the data sets. Then, we explore to use a machine learning method, the radial basis function network (RBFN), for the identification of animal ketamine addiction. This approach achieved good results with precision of 93.1034%. Experiments show that RBFN can achieve better results or very competitive results than other involved counterparts in precision and training time. In addition, the Relief algorithm was used to select the markers and analysis the change of the markers, which can be used to provide references for the clinical rational drug use and new ideas for the identification of drug dependence.

TI  - Construction and Validation of Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Chronic Post-Surgical Pain Among Patients Undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty
T2  - PAIN MANAGEMENT NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) is a common but undertreated condition with a high prevalence among patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). An effective model for CPSP prediction has not been established yet. Aims: To construct and validate machine learning models for the early prediction of CPSP among patients undergoing TKA. Design: A prospective cohort study. Participants/Subjects: A total of 320 patients in the modeling group and 150 patients in the validation group were recruited from two independent hospitals between December 2021 and July 2022. They were followed up for 6 months to determine the outcomes of CPSP through telephone interviews. Methods: Four machine learning algorithms were developed through 10-fold cross-validation for five times. In the validation group, the discrimination and calibration of the machine learning algorithms were compared by the logistic regression model. The importance of the variables in the best model identified was ranked. Results: The incidence of CPSP in the modeling group was 25.3%, and that in the validation group was 27.6%. Compared with other models, the random forest model achieved the best performance with the highest C-statistic of 0.897 and the lowest Brier score of 0.119 in the validation group. The top three important factors for predicting CPSP were knee joint function, fear of movement, and pain at rest in the baseline. Conclusions: The random forest model demonstrated good discrimination and calibration capacity for identifying patients undergoing TKA at high risk for CPSP. Clinical nurses would screen out high-risk patients for CPSP by using the risk factors identified in the random forest model, and efficiently distribute preventive strategy.

AB  - Project Summary/AbstractDespite significant advances in ventilator management, mortality from the acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volume, high pressure ven-tilation, and repeated alveolar collapse can injure the lung, called ventilator induced lung injury (VILI).

This proposal outlines a 5-year training programing including mentoring, formal didactics,and practical research experiences which positions Dr. Sottile for a successful clinical research career examiningventilator dyssynchrony (VD), its impact on ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), and its optimal management.An integrated curriculum will optimize an automated VD detection algorithm, delineate which types of VDare deleterious, and determine the ideal ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD and improvepatient outcomes. This experience will provide Dr. Sottile with the necessary tools to be a leader in signalanalysis, ventilator dyssynchrony, advanced mathematical modeling, and critical care research. This program willconsist of formal mentoring from four renowned experts in machine learning, mechanical ventilation, critical careresearch, and modeling of dynamic systems. In addition, coursework in clinical sciences, machine learning, andadvanced mathematical modeling will build the theoretical foundation to apply these techniques. This structuredcurriculum will help Dr. Sottile gain expertise in the computerized detection of VD from real-time ventilator data,the pathophysiology of VD, and the modeling of complex, temporally dynamic, biological systems.The formal curriculum will coincide with three practical experiences. First, Dr. Sottile will optimize his alreadydeveloped VD identification algorithm to detect additional types of VD that may be injurious to the lung. Second,he will identify which types of VD are associated with deleterious ventilator mechanics. Finally, he will deter-mine the personalized ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD, VILI, and the negative consequences ofover sedation using linear optimization and lagged linear correlation to account for the dynamic nature of patientphysiology.The result of the proposed studies will develop a computerized algorithm to detect seven types of VD,identify which types of VD are most likely to propagate VILI, and determine the optimal ventilator andsedation strategies to improve individual patient outcomes. This will leave Dr. Sottile and the study teampositioned to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing computer-predicted individualized ventilator and se-dation strategies compared to the current standard of care. If successful, this will potentially to revolutionize theuse of mechanical ventilation by tailoring evidenced-based therapies to the individual patient.

TI  - How to reduce failure to rescue after visceral surgery?
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISCERAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Mortality after visceral surgery has decreased owing to progress in surgical techniques, anesthesiology and intensive care. Mortality occurs in 5-10% of patients after major surgery and remains a topic of interest. However, the ratio of mortality after postoperative complications in relation to overall complications varies between hospitals because of failure to rescue at the time of the complication. There are multiple factors that lead to complicationrelated mortality: they are patient-related, disease-related, but are related, above all, to the timeliness of diagnosis of the complication, the organisational aspects of management in private or public hospitals, hospital volume that corresponds to the centralisation of initial management or to the concept of referral centre in case of complications, to the team spirit, to communication between the health care providers and to the management of the complication itself. Several organisational advances are to be considered, such as the development of shorter hospitalisations and notably ambulatory surgery, as well as enhanced recovery programs. Remote monitoring and the contribution of artificial intelligence must also be evaluated in this context. The reduction of mortality after visceral surgery rests on several tactics: prevention of potentially lethal complications, the all-important reduction of failure to rescue, and risk management before, during and after hospitalisations that are increasingly shorter.

TI  - Reconstruction of missing channel in electroencephalogram using spatiotemporal correlation-based averaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings often contain large segments with missing signals due to poor electrode contact or other artifact contamination. Recovering missing values, contaminated segments and lost channels could be highly beneficial, especially for automatic classification algorithms, such as machine/deep learning models, whose performance relies heavily on high-quality data. The current study proposes a new method for recovering missing segments in EEG. Approach. In the proposed method, the reconstructed segment is estimated by substitution of the missing part of the signal with the normalized weighted sum of other channels. The weighting process is based on inter-channel correlation of the non-missing preceding and proceeding temporal windows. The algorithm was designed to be computationally efficient. Experimental data from patients (N = 20) undergoing general anesthesia due to elective surgery were used for the validation of the algorithm. The data were recorded using a portable EEG device with ten channels and a self-adhesive frontal electrode during induction of anesthesia with propofol from waking state until burst suppression level, containing lots of variation in both amplitude and frequency properties. The proposed imputation technique was compared with another simple-structure technique. Distance correlation (DC) was used as a measure of comparison evaluation. Main results.: The proposed method, with an average DC of 82.48 +/- 10.01 (mu +/- sigma)%, outperformed its competitor with an average DC of 67.89 +/- 14.12 (mu +/- sigma)%. This algorithm also showed a better performance when increasing the number of missing channels. Significance. the proposed technique provides an easy-to-implement and computationally efficient approach for the reliable reconstruction of missing or contaminated EEG segments.

TI  - Prevalence of chronic pain in Pakistan-a national survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To assess the prevalence of chronic pain, its physical and psychosocial impact on daily life, and the various therapies adopted to alleviate pain.Method: The cross-sectional population-based telephonic survey was conducted from May to July 2021 at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised patients of either gender aged at least 18 years suffering from chronic pain who visited the institutional laboratory collection centres. In the first phase, people who were suffering from chronic pain were screened, while in the second phase, data was collected using a detailed questionnaire exploring pain history, treatment and its effects. The data was compiled and analysed using Antlere's AI based software.Results: Of the 4,801 patients contacted, 757(15.75%) were suffering from chronic pain. A total of 201(20%) subjects reported that their pain score was 5/10 on the numerical rating scale. Back pain was the major complaint (183, 18%) among the subjects. Of the total, 335(44.25%) were having active treatment, and 226 (67%) of them said the medication was effective. Overall, 706 (93%) patients had never visited a pain management specialist. Furthermore, 252 (33%) participants were diagnosed with depression, and 106 (14%) patients said that they were suicidal at some point in life.Conclusion: The survey observed that a high percentage of unawareness existed on pain management among the Pakistani citizens.

TI  - Negative Patient-Experience Comments After Total Shoulder Arthroplasty
T2  - JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is growing interest in enhancing the patient experience after discretionary orthopaedic surgery. Patient narratives are a potentially valuable but largely unscrutinized source of information. Using machine learning to understand sentiment within patient-experience comments, we explored the content of negative comments after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), their associated factors, and their relationship with traditional measures of patient satisfaction and with perioperative outcomes.Methods: An institutional registry was used to link the records of 186 patients who had undergone elective primary TSA between 2016 and 2017 with vendor-supplied patient satisfaction data, which included patient comments and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Using a machine-learning-based natural language processing approach, all patient comments were mined for sentiment and classified as positive, negative, mixed, or neutral. Negative comments were further classified into themes. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to determine characteristics associated with providing a negative comment.Results: Most patients (71%) provided at least 1 comment; 32% of the comments were negative, 62% were positive, 5% were mixed, and 1% were neutral. The themes of the negative comments were room condition (27%), time management (17%), inefficient communication (13%), lack of compassion (12%), difficult intravenous (IV) insertion (10%), food (10%), medication side effects (6%), discharge instructions (4%), and pain management (2%). Women and sicker patients were more likely to provide negative comments. Patients who made negative comments were more likely to be dissatisfied with overall hospital care and with pain management (2 HCAHPS core items), but there were no differences in any of the studied outcomes (peak pain intensity, opioid intake, operative time, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, or 1-year American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons EASES] score) between those who provided negative comments and those who did not.Conclusions: Patient-narrative analysis can shed light on the aspects of the process of care that are most critiqued by patients. While patient satisfaction may not be a surrogate for effectiveness of care or functional outcomes, efforts to improve the hospital environment, enhance nontechnical skills, and reduce unnecessary delays are important in providing high-quality, patient-centered care after TSA.

TI  - Artificial intelligence using deep neural network learning for automatic location of the interscalene brachial plexus in ultrasound images
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Identifying the interscalene brachial plexus can be challenging during ultrasound-guided interscalene block.OBJECTIVE We hypothesised that an algorithm based on deep learning could locate the interscalene brachial plexus in ultrasound images better than a nonexpert anaesthesiologist, thus possessing the potential to aid anaesthesiologists.DESIGN Observational study.SETTING A tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China.PATIENTS Patients undergoing elective surgery.INTERVENTIONS Ultrasound images at the interscalene level were collected from patients. Two independent image datasets were prepared to train and evaluate the deep learning model. Three senior anaesthesiologists who were experts in regional anaesthesia annotated the images. A deep convolutional neural network was developed, trained and optimised to locate the interscalene brachial plexus in the ultrasound images. Expert annotations on the datasets were regarded as an accurate baseline (ground truth). The test dataset was also annotated by five nonexpert anaesthesiologists.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome of the research was the distance between the lateral midpoints of the nerve sheath contours of the model predictions and ground truth.RESULTS The data set was obtained from 1126 patients. The training dataset comprised 11 392 images from 1076 patients. The test dataset constituted 100 images from 50 patients. In the test dataset, the median [IQR] distance between the lateral midpoints of the nerve sheath contours of the model predictions and ground truth was 0.8 [0.4 to 2.9] mm: this was significantly shorter than that between nonexpert predictions and ground truth (3.4 mm [2.1 to 4.5] mm; P < 0.001).CONCLUSION The proposed model was able to locate the interscalene brachial plexus in ultrasound images more accurately than nonexperts.

TI  - Closed-Loop Controlled Fluid Administration Systems: A Comprehensive Scoping Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Physiological Closed-Loop Controlled systems continue to take a growing part in clinical practice, offering possibilities of providing more accurate, goal-directed care while reducing clinicians' cognitive and task load. These systems also provide a standardized approach for the clinical management of the patient, leading to a reduction in care variability across multiple dimensions. For fluid management and administration, the advantages of closed-loop technology are clear, especially in conditions that require precise care to improve outcomes, such as peri-operative care, trauma, and acute burn care. Controller design varies from simplistic to complex designs, based on detailed physiological models and adaptive properties that account for inter-patient and intra-patient variability; their maturity level ranges from theoretical models tested in silico to commercially available, FDA-approved products. This comprehensive scoping review was conducted in order to assess the current technological landscape of this field, describe the systems currently available or under development, and suggest further advancements that may unfold in the coming years. Ten distinct systems were identified and discussed.

TI  - Prediction of breakthrough pain during labour neuraxial analgesia: comparison of machine learning and multivariable regression approaches
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRIC ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Risk-prediction models for breakthrough pain facilitate interventions to forestall inadequate labour analgesia, but limited work has used machine learning to identify predictive factors. We compared the performance of machine learning and regression techniques in identifying parturients at increased risk of breakthrough pain during labour epidural analgesia.Methods: A single-centre retrospective study involved parturients receiving patient-controlled epidural analgesia. The primary outcome was breakthrough pain. We randomly selected 80% of the cohort (training cohort) to develop three prediction models using random forest, XGBoost, and logistic regression, followed by validation against the remaining 20% of the cohort (validation cohort). Area-under-the-receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were used to assess model performance.Results: Data from 20 716 parturients were analysed. The incidence of breakthrough pain was 14.2%. Of 31 candidate variables, random forest, XGBoost and logistic regression models included 30, 23, and 15 variables, respectively. Unintended venous puncture, post-neuraxial analgesia highest pain score, number of dinoprostone suppositories, neuraxial technique, number of neuraxial attempts, depth to epidural space, body mass index, pre-neuraxial analgesia oxytocin infusion rate, maternal age, pre-neuraxial analgesia cervical dilation, anaesthesiologist rank, and multiparity, were identified in all three models. All three models performed similarly, with AUC 0.763-0.772, sensitivity 67.0-69.4%, specificity 70.9-76.2%, PPV 28.3-31.8%, and NPV 93.3-93.5%.Conclusions: Machine learning did not improve the prediction of breakthrough pain compared with multivariable regression. Larger population-wide studies are needed to improve predictive ability. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Machine Learning Algorithm Outperforms Traditional Multiple Regression to Predict Risk of Unplanned Overnight Stay Following Outpatient Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction.
T2  - Arthroscopy, sports medicine, and rehabilitation
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Purpose: To determine whether conventional logistic regression or machine learning algorithms were more precise in identifying the risk factors for unplanned overnight admission after medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction.Methods: A retrospective review of the prospectively collected National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was performed to identify patients who underwent outpatient MPFL reconstruction from 2006-2018. Patients admitted overnight were identified as those with length of stay of 1 or more days. Models were generated using random forest, extreme gradient boosting, adaptive boosting, or elastic net penalized logistic regression, and an additional model was produced as a weighted ensemble of the 4 final algorithms. The predictive capacity of these models was compared to that of logistic regression.Results: Of the 1307 patients identified, 221 (16.9%) required at least one overnight stay after MPFL reconstruction. Multivariate logistic regression found the following variables to be predictors of inpatient admission: age (odds ratio [OR]= 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.02-1.04]; P <.001), spinal anesthesia (OR= 3.42 [95% CI 1.98-6.08]; P < .001), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 3/4 (OR= 1.96 [95% CI 1.25-3.06]; P < .001), history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR= 6.44 [95% CI 1.58-26.17]; P= .02), and body mass index (BMI) (OR= 1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.05]; P < .001). The ensemble model achieved the best performance based on discrimination assessed via internal validation (area under the curve= 0.722). The variables determined most important by the ensemble model were increasing BMI, increasing age, ASA class, anesthesia, smoking, hypertension, lateral release, and history of COPD.Conclusions: An internally validated machine learning algorithm outperformed logistic regression modeling in predicting the need for unplanned overnight hospitalization after MPFL reconstruction. In this model, the most significant risk factors for admission were age, BMI, ASA class, smoking status, hypertension, lateral release, and history of COPD. This tool can be deployed to augment provider assessment to identify high-risk candidates and appropriately set postoperative expectations for patients.Clinical Relevance: Identifying and mitigating patient risk factors to prevent adverse surgical outcomes and hospitalizations is one of our primary goals. There may be a key role for machine learning algorithms to help successfully and efficiently risk stratify patients to decrease costs, appropriately set postoperative expectations, and increase the quality of delivered care.

TI  - Effect of Intraoperative Infusion of Esketamine on Quality of Postoperative Recovery in Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - PAIN AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy of esketamine on postoperative recovery quality after laparoscopic bariatric surgery.MethodsPatients (n = 74) scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomly divided into two groups: the esketamine group (group E: 0.5 mg/kg/h infusion, i.e., 0.2 mL/kg/h) or the control group (group C: 0.2 mL/kg/h normal saline infusion). The infusions were stopped 20 min before the end of the procedure. The primary outcome was the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) score on postoperative day 1 (POD 1). The secondary outcomes included QoR-40 scores on PODs 2 and 7, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) on PODs 1, 2, and 7, time to extubation, additional postoperative analgesic use, length of hospital stay, and time to first exhaust. Additonally, the safety indices were also recorded, including hemodynamic profile, perioperative anesthesia index (Ai), utilization of vasoactive drugs or urapidil, and side effects.ResultsAll in all, 70 of the 74 patients completed the study, 35 in each group. The difference of QoR-40 scores on POD 1 was both statistically and clinically significant [difference 7.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.17, 9.25, p < 0.001]. The difference of QoR-40 on POD 2 was statistically significant but clinically insignificant (difference 4.81, 95% CI 2.69, 6.92, p < 0.001). The difference of NRS scores on POD 1 was statistically significant (difference -1.23, 95% CI -2.36, -0.10, p = 0.033). Compared with group C, group E had a lower utilization rate of phenylephrine and higher Ai values (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the two groups on other measures.ConclusionContinuous ketamine infusion seems to be safe and well tolerated in laparoscopic bariatric surgery. It improved the quality of postoperative recovery and reduced pain on POD 1. In spite of the increased Ai value during the surgery, it also provided better hemodynamics with less usage of phenylephrine.

TI  - Machine learning model-based risk prediction of severe complications after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Compared with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) under cardiopulmonary bypass, off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is minimally invasive and reduces the risk of intraoperative blood transfusion and acute kidney injury. Nonetheless, OPCAB-related complications still pose a threat. Machine learning technology can analyze a large number of clinical data, establish risk prediction models and help clinicians make early and correct clinical decisions.Objectives. Risk prediction models are available for mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery, but they are not specific to OPCAB. This study aimed to develop a predictive model of severe complications after OPCAB, based on machine learning.Materials and methods. Anesthesia records of OPCAB from the General Hospital of the Northern Theater Command (Shenyang, China) collected between January 1, 2019, and June 15, 2020, were analyzed. The endpoint of the study was the occurrence of serious complications after OPCAB (postoperative unplanned intra-aortic balloon pump, secondary surgery and death). The features entered into the models were as follows: intraoperative ventricular fibrillation, number of saphenous vein grafts, nerve block (NeB), venous oxygen saturation (SvO(2)), skin incision-bypass time, and hypertension. A total of 8 machine learning algorithms were tested: logistic regression analysis (LRA), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical features gradient boosting (CatBoost).Results. Among the 506 patients found in the records, 27 met the endpoint. The highest area under the curve (AUC) value was achieved with the XGBoost model (AUC = 0.94), and the lowest with the SVM model (AUC = 0.75). The highest and lowest accuracy were observed with the XGBoost and NB models, respectively, while the highest and lowest precision were achieved using the SVM and NB models, respectively. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the XGBoost model was selected as the most useful in this study.Conclusions. This study suggests using the XGBoost model to predict the risk of complications after OPCAB.

TI  - Temporal Generalizability of Machine Learning Models for Predicting Postoperative Delirium Using Electronic Health Record Data: Model Development and Validation Study.
T2  - JMIR perioperative medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although machine learning models demonstrate significant potential in predicting postoperative delirium, the advantages of their implementation in real-world settings remain unclear and require a comparison with conventional models in practical applications.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to validate the temporal generalizability of decision tree ensemble and sparse linear regression models for predicting delirium after surgery compared with that of the traditional logistic regression model.METHODS: The health record data of patients hospitalized at an advanced emergency and critical care medical center in Kumamoto, Japan, were collected electronically. We developed a decision tree ensemble model using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and a sparse linear regression model using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. To evaluate the predictive performance of the model, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) to measure discrimination and the slope and intercept of the regression between predicted and observed probabilities to measure calibration. The Brier score was evaluated as an overall performance metric. We included 11,863 consecutive patients who underwent surgery with general anesthesia between December 2017 and February 2022. The patients were divided into a derivation cohort before the COVID-19 pandemic and a validation cohort during the COVID-19 pandemic. Postoperative delirium was diagnosed according to the confusion assessment method.RESULTS: A total of 6497 patients (68.5, SD 14.4 years, women n=2627, 40.4%) were included in the derivation cohort, and 5366 patients (67.8, SD 14.6 years, women n=2105, 39.2%) were included in the validation cohort. Regarding discrimination, the XGBoost model (AUROC 0.87-0.90 and MCC 0.34-0.44) did not significantly outperform the LASSO model (AUROC 0.86-0.89 and MCC 0.34-0.41). The logistic regression model (AUROC 0.84-0.88, MCC 0.33-0.40, slope 1.01-1.19, intercept -0.16 to 0.06, and Brier score 0.06-0.07), with 8 predictors (age, intensive care unit, neurosurgery, emergency admission, anesthesia time, BMI, blood loss during surgery, and use of an ambulance) achieved good predictive performance.CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model did not significantly outperform the LASSO model in predicting postoperative delirium. Furthermore, a parsimonious logistic model with a few important predictors achieved comparable performance to machine learning models in predicting postoperative delirium.

TI  - Fetal heart rate changes and labor neuraxial analgesia: a machine learning approach
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNeuraxial labor analgesia has been associated with fetal heart rate changes. Fetal bradycardia is multifactorial, and predicting it poses a significant challenge to clinicians. Machine learning algorithms may assist the clinician to predict fetal bradycardia and identify predictors associated with its presentation.MethodsA retrospective analysis of 1077 healthy laboring parturients receiving neuraxial analgesia was conducted. We compared a principal components regression model with tree-based random forest, ridge regression, multiple regression, a general additive model, and elastic net in terms of prediction accuracy and interpretability for inference purposes.ResultsMultiple regression identified combined spinal-epidural (CSE) (p = 0.02), interaction between CSE and dose of phenylephrine (p < 0.0001), decelerations (p < 0.001), and the total dose of bupivacaine (p = 0.03) as associated with decrease in fetal heart rate. Random forest exhibited good predictive accuracy (mean standard error of 0.92).ConclusionUse of CSE, presence of decelerations, total dose of bupivacaine, and total dose of vasopressors after CSE are associated with decreases in fetal heart rate in healthy parturients during labor. Prediction of changes in fetal heart rate can be approached with a tree-based random forest model with good accuracy with important variables that are key for the prediction, such as CSE, BMI, duration of stage 1 of labor, and dose of bupivacaine.

TI  - Water immersion vs. air insufflation in canine duodenal endoscopy: is the future underwater?
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Endoscopy represents a commonly employed technique for canine enteropathies. Different trials in human intestinal endoscopy have suggested that the introduction of water for luminal distension, in place of air, improves the visualization of the mucosal texture and decreases pain.The aim of the study was to compare water immersion (WI) vs. air insufflation (AI) during duodenoscopy in anesthetized dogs in terms of mucosal visualization and nociception.Twenty-five dogs undergoing duodenoscopy were included. The same image of the descending duodenum was recorded applying WI and AI. Each pair of images was analyzed using morphological skeletonization, an image entropy evaluation, and a subjective blind evaluation by three experienced endoscopists. To evaluate differences in nociception related to the procedure applied, heart rate and arterial blood pressure were measured before, during and after WI/AI. To compare the two methods, a t-test for paired data was applied for the image analysis, Fleiss' Kappa evaluation for the subjective evaluation and a Friedman test for anesthetic parameters.No differences were found between WI and AI using morphological skeletonization and entropy. The subjective evaluation identified the WI images as qualitatively better than the AI images, indicating substantial agreement between the operators. No differences in nociception were found.The results of the study pointed out the absence of changes in pain response between WI and AI, likely due to the sufficient control of nociception by the anesthesia. Based on subjective evaluation, but not confirmed by the image analysis, WI provided better image quality than AI.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To conduct a cost-utility analysis of a novel genetic diagnostic test (OUDTEST) for risk of developing opioid use disorder for elective orthopedic surgery patients. Materials & Methods: A simulation model assessed cost-effectiveness and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for OUDTEST from private insurer and self-insured employer perspectives over a 5-year time horizon for a hypothetical patient population. Results: OUDTEST was found to cost less and increase QALYs, over a 5-year period for private insurance (savings US$2510; QALYs 0.02) and self-insured employers (-US$2682; QALYs 0.02). OUDTEST was a dominant strategy in 71.1% (private insurance) and 72.7% (self-insured employer) of model iterations. Sensitivity analyses revealed robust results except for physician compliance. Conclusion: OUDTEST was expected to be a cost-effective solution for personalizing postsurgical pain management in orthopedic patients.

TI  - Machine learning approach to predicting persistent opioid use following lower extremity joint arthroplasty
T2  - REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The objective of this study is to develop predictive models for persistent opioid use following lower extremity joint arthroplasty and determine if ensemble learning and an oversampling technique may improve model performance. Methods We compared various predictive models to identify at-risk patients for persistent postoperative opioid use using various preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data, including surgical procedure, patient demographics/characteristics, past surgical history, opioid use history, comorbidities, lifestyle habits, anesthesia details, and postoperative hospital course. Six classification models were evaluated: logistic regression, random forest classifier, simple-feedforward neural network, balanced random forest classifier, balanced bagging classifier, and support vector classifier. Performance with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was also evaluated. Repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation was implemented to calculate F1-scores and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Results There were 1042 patients undergoing elective knee or hip arthroplasty in which 242 (23.2%) reported persistent opioid use. Without SMOTE, the logistic regression model has an F1 score of 0.47 and an AUC of 0.79. All ensemble methods performed better, with the balanced bagging classifier having an F1 score of 0.80 and an AUC of 0.94. SMOTE improved performance of all models based on F1 score. Specifically, performance of the balanced bagging classifier improved to an F1 score of 0.84 and an AUC of 0.96. The features with the highest importance in the balanced bagging model were postoperative day 1 opioid use, body mass index, age, preoperative opioid use, prescribed opioids at discharge, and hospital length of stay. Conclusions Ensemble learning can dramatically improve predictive models for persistent opioid use. Accurate and early identification of high-risk patients can play a role in clinical decision making and early optimization with personalized interventions.

TI  - Lasso-Based Machine Learning Algorithm for Predicting Postoperative Lung Complications in Elderly: A Single-Center Retrospective Study from China
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The predictive effect of systemic inflammatory factors on postoperative pulmonary complications in elderly patients remains unclear. In addition, machine learning models are rarely used in prediction models for elderly patients. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated elderly patients who underwent general anesthesia during a 6-year period. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to the development group and validation group. The Least logistic absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to select the optimal feature. The discrimination, calibration and net reclassification improvement (NRI) of the final model were compared with "the Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalonia" (ARISCAT) model.Results: Of the 9775 patients analyzed, 8.31% developed PPCs. The final model included age, preoperative SpO2, ANS (the Albumin/NLR Score), operation time, and red blood cells (RBC) transfusion. The concordance index (C-index) values of the model for the development cohort and the validation cohort were 0.740 and 0.748, respectively. The P values of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test in two cohorts were insignificant. Our model outperformed ARISCAT model, with C-index (0.740 VS 0.717, P = 0.003) and NRI (0.117, P < 0.001).Conclusion: Based on LASSO machine learning algorithm, we constructed a prediction model superior to ARISCAT model in predicting the risk of PPCs. Clinicians could utilize these predictors to optimize prospective and preventive interventions in this patient population.

TI  - Adrenal Crisis During Cesarean Section in a Patient With Primary Adrenal Insufficiency
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a type of primary adrenal insufficiency (AI) that predisposes to adrenal crisis (AC) during stress. We describe a case of a primipara with CAH who was admitted in labor. To prevent AC, glucocorticoid replacement was given according to guidelines. Due to fetal decelerations, an emergency C-section was performed under general anesthesia following which refractory hypotension emerged. The diagnosis of AC was considered, and hydrocortisone was given with sustained hemodynamic improvement. AC is a life-threatening emergency whose diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Despite adequate steroid coverage, additional stressors may precipitate AC, so it is of paramount importance that anesthesiologists consider this emergency.

TI  - Utilizing Artificial Intelligence and Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer to Answer Questions About Clinical Scenarios in Neuroanesthesiology.
T2  - Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We tested the ability of chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence chatbot, to answer questions relevant to scenarios covered in 3 clinical guidelines, published by the Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care (SNACC), which has published management guidelines: endovascular treatment of stroke, perioperative stroke (Stroke), and care of patients undergoing complex spine surgery (Spine).METHODS: Four neuroanesthesiologists independently assessed whether ChatGPT could apply 52 high-quality recommendations (HQRs) included in the 3 SNACC guidelines. HQRs were deemed present in the ChatGPT responses if noted by at least 3 of the 4 reviewers. Reviewers also identified incorrect references, potentially harmful recommendations, and whether ChatGPT cited the SNACC guidelines.RESULTS: The overall reviewer agreement for the presence of HQRs in the ChatGPT answers ranged from 0% to 100%. Only 4 of 52 (8%) HQRs were deemed present by at least 3 of the 4 reviewers after 5 generic questions, and 23 (44%) HQRs were deemed present after at least 1 additional targeted question. Potentially harmful recommendations were identified for each of the 3 clinical scenarios and ChatGPT failed to cite the SNACC guidelines.CONCLUSIONS: The ChatGPT answers were open to human interpretation regarding whether the responses included the HQRs. Though targeted questions resulted in the inclusion of more HQRs than generic questions, fewer than 50% of HQRs were noted even after targeted questions. This suggests that ChatGPT should not currently be considered a reliable source of information for clinical decision-making. Future iterations of ChatGPT may refine algorithms to improve its reliability as a source of clinical information.

TI  - Replicating human expertise of mechanical ventilation waveform analysis in detecting patient-ventilator cycling asynchrony using machine learning
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Acute respiratory failure is one of the most common problems encountered in intensive care units (ICU) and mechanical ventilation is the mainstay of supportive therapy for such patients. A mismatch between ventilator delivery and patient demand is referred to as patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA). An important hurdle in addressing PVA is the lack of a reliable framework for continuously and automatically monitoring the patient and detecting various types of PVA.Methods: The problem of replicating human expertise of waveform analysis for detecting cycling asynchrony (i.e., delayed termination, premature termination, or none) was investigated in a pilot study involving 11 patients in the ICU under invasive mechanical ventilation. A machine learning framework is used to detect cycling asynchrony based on waveform analysis.Results: A panel of five experts with experience in PVA evaluated a total of 1377 breath cycles from 11 mechanically ventilated critical care patients. The majority vote was used to label each breath cycle according to cycling asynchrony type. The proposed framework accurately detected the presence or absence of cycling asynchrony with sensitivity (specificity) of 89% (99%), 94% (98%), and 97% (93%) for delayed termination, premature termination, and no cycling asynchrony, respectively. The system showed strong agreement with human experts as reflected by the kappa coefficients of 0.90, 0.91, and 0.90 for delayed termination, premature termination, and no cycling asynchrony, respectively.Conclusions: The pilot study establishes the feasibility of using a machine learning framework to provide waveform analysis equivalent to an expert human.

TI  - Using machine learning to ensure safety of patients who cannot remain still during magnetic resonance imaging
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Ultrahigh field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF-MRI, &gt;=7T) offers previously unattainable levels of image quality and tissue detail. However, several patient populations may not stay still during magnetic resonance imaging, including paediatric patients and people with dementia, Parkinson's, Tourette's and Huntington's. We have recently demonstrated that within-scan patient motion may increase patient heating by up to 3.1-fold above the safety limits (Kopanoglu,MRM,2020) Although sedation can mitigate movement, it may cause adverse side effects and even, with an adverse effect, hospitalization. We demonstrated that, if we know the effect of patient motion on UHF-MRI scan dynamics, we could instead correct them during the scan (Kopanoglu,ISMRM,2018). Unfortunately, these effects cannot be measured, but our feasibility study on using a Machine Learning method (Method-1) to estimate these changes yielded exciting initial results. With this missing link complete, we can ensure safety of patients who cannot remain still while acquiring high quality images.

M3  - Systematic Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Accessory innervation (AI) may account for the persistent sensation perceived after successful mandibular anesthesia in the adult patient. The purpose of this systematic review was to record the quality of evidence pertaining to the cervical plexus (CP) AI in dental anesthesia.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic and manual searches were conducted using Ovid and Medline of articles published from 1922 to March of 2015. Studies written in any language were included as long as they involved: (i) humans, animals, and/or cadavers AND (ii) anatomical and/or research anesthetic-technique approaches and/or clinical approaches. Exclusion criteria were (i) maxillary buccal infiltration, (ii) no abstract/paper available, (iii) studies that do not comprise the description of the branches of the CP branches in dentistry and (iv) duplicated articles. The articles were reviewed and graded by levels of evidence (LOE) through a methodological scoring index (MSI).RESULTS: Forty-four out of 185 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One randomized control trial, 3 comprehensive reviews, 1 cohort study, 5 case series/reports, 16 poor-quality cohort and case series/reports and 18 reviews/case, reports/expert opinions were found. Of the 44 publications, there were 4 LOE 1, 1 LOE 2, 5 LOE 3, 20 LOE 4 and 14 LOE 5 studies.CONCLUSIONS: The MSI helped to classify papers LOE in a standardized and objective approach. The objective evidence quality occurrence recorded was found to be LOE 4 (n = 20) > LOE 5 (n = 14) > LOE 3 (n = 5) > LOE 1 (n = 4) > LOE 2 (n = 1). The anatomy of the CP needs to be reexamined and understood in the anatomical literature.

AB  - BackgroundIntraoperative hypotension (IOH) is a common complication occurring in surgical practice. This study aims to comprehensively review the collaboration and impact of countries, institutions, authors, journals, keywords, and critical papers on intraoperative hypotension from the perspective of bibliometric, and to evaluate the evolution of knowledge structure clustering and identify research hotspots and emerging topics.MethodsArticles and reviews related to IOH published from 2004 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric analyses and visualization were conducted on Excel, CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix (R-Tool of R-Studio).ResultsA total of 1,784 articles and reviews were included from 2004 to 2022. The number of articles on IOH gradually increased in the past few years, and peaked in 2021. These publications were chiefly from 1,938 institutions in 40 countries, led by America and China in publications. Sessler Daniel I published the most papers and enjoyed the highest number of citations. Analysis of the journals with the most outputs showed that most journals concentrated on perioperative medicine and clinical anesthesiology. Delirium, acute kidney injury and vasoconstrictor agents are the current and developing research hotspots. The keywords "Acute kidney injury", "postoperative complication", "machine learning", "risk factors" and "hemodynamic instability" may also become new trends and focuses of the near future research.ConclusionThis study uses bibliometrics and visualization methods to comprehensively review the research on intraoperative hypotension, which is helpful for scholars to better understand the dynamic evolution of IOH and provide directions for future research.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Pathological Upgrade From Combined Transperineal Systematic and MRI-Targeted Prostate Biopsy to Final Pathology: A Multicenter Retrospective Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the pathological concordance from combined systematic and MRI-targeted prostate biopsy to final pathology and to verify the effectiveness of a machine learning-based model with targeted biopsy (TB) features in predicting pathological upgrade. Materials and MethodsAll patients in this study underwent prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), transperineal systematic plus transperineal targeted prostate biopsy under local anesthesia, and robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer (PCa) sequentially from October 2016 to February 2020 in two referral centers. For cores with cancer, grade group (GG) and Gleason score were determined by using the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) guidelines. Four supervised machine learning methods were employed, including two base classifiers and two ensemble learning-based classifiers. In all classifiers, the training set was 395 of 565 (70%) patients, and the test set was the remaining 170 patients. The prediction performance of each model was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The Gini index was used to evaluate the importance of all features and to figure out the most contributed features. A nomogram was established to visually predict the risk of upgrading. Predicted probability was a prevalence rate calculated by a proposed nomogram. ResultsA total of 515 patients were included in our cohort. The combined biopsy had a better concordance of postoperative histopathology than a systematic biopsy (SB) only (48.15% vs. 40.19%, p = 0.012). The combined biopsy could significantly reduce the upgrading rate of postoperative pathology, in comparison to SB only (23.30% vs. 39.61%, p < 0.0001) or TB only (23.30% vs. 40.19%, p < 0.0001). The most common pathological upgrade occurred in ISUP GG1 and GG2, accounting for 53.28% and 20.42%, respectively. All machine learning methods had satisfactory predictive efficacy. The overall accuracy was 0.703, 0.768, 0.794, and 0.761 for logistic regression, random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and support vector machine, respectively. TB-related features were among the most contributed features of a prediction model for upgrade prediction. ConclusionThe combined effect of SB plus TB led to a better pathological concordance rate and less upgrading from biopsy to RP. Machine learning models with features of TB to predict PCa GG upgrading have a satisfactory predictive efficacy.

TI  - Development and validation of an interpretable neural network for prediction of postoperative in-hospital mortality
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - While deep neural networks (DNNs) and other machine learning models often have higher accuracy than simpler models like logistic regression (LR), they are often considered to be "black box" models and this lack of interpretability and transparency is considered a challenge for clinical adoption. In healthcare, intelligible models not only help clinicians to understand the problem and create more targeted action plans, but also help to gain the clinicians' trust. One method of overcoming the limited interpretability of more complex models is to use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Standard GAMs simply model the target response as a sum of univariate models. Inspired by GAMs, the same idea can be applied to neural networks through an architecture referred to as Generalized Additive Models with Neural Networks (GAM-NNs). In this manuscript, we present the development and validation of a model applying the concept of GAM-NNs to allow for interpretability by visualizing the learned feature patterns related to risk of in-hospital mortality for patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. The data consists of 59,985 patients with a feature set of 46 features extracted at the end of surgery to which we added previously not included features: total anesthesia case time (1 feature); the time in minutes spent with mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 mmHg during surgery (6 features); and Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Code Descriptions of the Primary current procedure terminology (CPT) codes (33 features) for a total of 86 features. All data were randomly split into 80% for training (n = 47,988) and 20% for testing (n = 11,997) prior to model development. Model performance was compared to a standard LR model using the same features as the GAM-NN. The data consisted of 59,985 surgical records, and the occurrence of in-hospital mortality was 0.81% in the training set and 0.72% in the testing set. The GAM-NN model with HCUP features had the highest area under the curve (AUC) 0.921 (0.895-0.95). Overall, both GAM-NN models had higher AUCs than LR models, however, had lower average precisions. The LR model without HCUP features had the highest average precision 0.217 (0.136-0.31). To assess the interpretability of the GAM-NNs, we then visualized the learned contributions of the GAM-NNs and compared against the learned contributions of the LRs for the models with HCUP features. Overall, we were able to demonstrate that our proposed generalized additive neural network (GAM-NN) architecture is able to (1) leverage a neural network's ability to learn nonlinear patterns in the data, which is more clinically intuitive, (2) be interpreted easily, making it more clinically useful, and (3) maintain model performance as compared to previously published DNNs.

TI  - A retrospective study of mortality for perioperative cardiac arrests toward a personalized treatment
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Perioperative cardiac arrest (POCA) is associated with a high mortality rate. This work aimed to study its prognostic factors for risk mitigation by means of care management and planning. A database of 380,919 surgeries was reviewed, and 150 POCAs were curated. The main outcome was mortality prior to hospital discharge. Patient demographic, medical history, and clinical characteristics (anesthesia and surgery) were the main features. Six machine learning (ML) algorithms, including LR, SVC, RF, GBM, AdaBoost, and VotingClassifier, were explored. The last algorithm was an ensemble of the first five algorithms. k-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping minimized the prediction bias and variance, respectively. Explainers (SHAP and LIME) were used to interpret the predictions. The ensemble provided the most accurate and robust predictions (AUC = 0.90 [95% CI, 0.78-0.98]) across various age groups. The risk factors were identified by order of importance. Surprisingly, the comorbidity of hypertension was found to have a protective effect on survival, which was reported by a recent study for the first time to our knowledge. The validated ensemble classifier in aid of the explainers improved the predictive differentiation, thereby deepening our understanding of POCA prognostication. It offers a holistic model-based approach for personalized anesthesia and surgical treatment.

TI  - Enhancing epidural needle guidance using a polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography probe with convolutional neural networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Epidural anesthesia helps manage pain during different surgeries. Nonetheless, the precise placement of the epidural needle remains a challenge. In this study, we developed a probe based on polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) to enhance the epidural anesthesia needle placement. The probe was tested on six porcine spinal samples. The multimodal imaging guidance used the OCT intensity mode and three distinct PS-OCT modes: (1) phase retardation, (2) optic axis, and (3) degree of polarization uniformity (DOPU). Each mode enabled the classification of different epidural tissues through distinct imaging characteristics. To further streamline the tissue recognition procedure, convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to autonomously identify the tissue types within the probe's field of view. ResNet50 models were developed for all four imaging modes. DOPU imaging was found to provide the highest cross-testing accuracy of 91.53%. These results showed the improved precision by PS-OCT in guiding epidural anesthesia needle placement.

TI  - Global updates in the treatment of gastric cancer: a systematic review. Part 2: perioperative management, multimodal therapies, new technologies, standardization of the surgical treatment and educational aspects
T2  - UPDATES IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Gastric cancer is the fifth malignancy and the third cause of cancer death worldwide, according to the global cancer statistics presented in 2018. Its definition and staging have been revised in the eight edition of the AJCC/TNM classification, which took effect in 2018. Novel molecular classifications for GC have been recently established and the process of translating these classifications into clinical practice is ongoing. The cornerstone of GC treatment is surgical, in a context of multimodal therapy. Surgical treatment is being standardized, and is evolving according to new anatomical concepts and to the recent technological developments. This is leading to a massive improvement in the use of mini-invasive techniques. Mini-invasive techniques aim to be equivalent to open surgery from an oncologic point of view, with better short-term outcomes. The persecution of better short-term outcomes also includes the optimization of the perioperative management, which is being implemented on large scale according to the enhanced recovery after surgery principles. In the era of precision medicine, multimodal treatment is also evolving. The long-time-awaited results of many trials investigating the role for preoperative and postoperative management have been published, changing the clinical practice. Novel investigations focused both on traditional chemotherapeutic regimens and targeted therapies are currently ongoing. Modern platforms increase the possibility for further standardization of the different treatments, promote the use of big data and open new possibilities for surgical learning. This systematic review in two parts assesses all the current updates in GC treatment.

TI  - Mathematical and Computational Models for Pain: A Systematic Review
T2  - PAIN MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective. There is no single prevailing theory of pain that explains its origin, qualities, and alleviation. Although many studies have investigated various molecular targets for pain management, few have attempted to examine the etiology or working mechanisms of pain through mathematical or computational model development. In this systematic review, we identified and classified mathematical and computational models for characterizing pain. Methods. The databases queried were Science Direct and PubMed, yielding 560 articles published prior to January 1st, 2020. After screening for inclusion of mathematical or computational models of pain, 31 articles were deemed relevant. Results. Most of the reviewed articles utilized classification algorithms to categorize pain and no-pain conditions. We found the literature heavily focused on the application of existing models or machine learning algorithms to identify the presence or absence of pain, rather than to explore features of pain that may be used for diagnostics and treatment. Conclusions. Although understudied, the development of mathematical models may augment the current understanding of pain by providing directions for testable hypotheses of its underlying mechanisms. Additional focus is needed on developing models that seek to understand the underlying mechanisms of pain, as this could potentially lead to major breakthroughs in its treatment.

TI  - Enhanced needle localization in ultrasound using beam steering and learning-based segmentation
T2  - COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Segmentation of needles in ultrasound images remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning-based method for needle segmentation in 2D beam-steered ultrasound images. We used a statistical boosting approach to train a pixel-wise classifier for needle segmentation. The Radon transform was then used to find the needle position and orientation from the segmented image. We validated our method with data from ex vivo specimens and clinical nerve block procedures, and compared the results to those obtained using previously reported needle segmentation methods. Results show improved localization success and accuracy using the proposed method. For the ex vivo datasets, assuming that the needle orientation was known a priori, the needle was successfully localized in 86.2% of the images, with a mean targeting error of 0.48 mm. The robustness of the proposed method to a lack of a priori knowledge of needle orientation was also demonstrated. For the clinical datasets, assuming that the needle orientation was closely aligned with the beam steering angle selected by the physician, the needle was successfully localized in 99.8% of the images, with a mean targeting error 0.19 mm. These results indicate that the learning-based segmentation method may allow for increased targeting accuracy and enhanced visualization during ultrasound-guided needle procedures.

TI  - Improvement of Pain Management by Nefopam in a Rat Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model is widely used in research to investigate arthritis pathogenesis. Hind paw inflammation is the main outcome in this model with high loss of mobility function partly related to pain. However, analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioid drugs interfere with the inflammation process related to arthritis, thus reducing their beneficial use in this model. Therefore, we investigated the effect of nefopam on arthritis development in order to improve pain management in the AIA model. MethodsFemale Lewis rats were randomly divided into two groups, and each group received an injection of Mycobacterium butyricum on defining day (D) 0. At D6, rats (n = 10) received nefopam (intraperitoneally or orally) or NaCl 0.9% IP or 1% sucrose in water (n = 5 for each). Rats were monitored with the arthritic index (AI) and ankle circumference. Pain was assessed by scoring based on behavioral indicators. Histology, RT-qPCR, and microcomputed tomography were performed. ResultsThe clinical parameter AI and ankle circumference were not different in both groups at various time points. However, pain score was significantly lower in the nefopam group at the early stage of the disease. At a later stage of the disease, inflammation was mildly lower whereas bone erosion and bone loss parameters increased in the nefopam group. ConclusionNefopam provided a slight reduction in the level of pain at the arthritis onset without reducing arthritis severity and bone loss in the rat AIA model. However, it should be administrated orally for a shorter period to avoid inflammation reduction in the long run.

TI  - Left-colon water exchange preserves the benefits of whole colon water exchange at reduced cecal intubation time conferring significant advantage in diagnostic colonoscopy - a prospective, randomized controlled trial
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Whole-colon water exchange (WWE) reduces insertion pain, increases cecal intubation success and adenoma detection rate, but requires longer insertion time, compared to air insufflation (AI) colonoscopy. We hypothesized that water exchange limited to the left colon (LWE) can speed up insertion with equivalent results. Methods: This prospective, randomized controlled study (NCT01735266) allocated patients (18-80 years) to WWE, LWE or AI group (1: 1: 1). The primary outcome was cecal intubation time. Results: Three hundred subjects were randomized to the WWE (n = 100), LWE (n = 100) or AI group (n = 100). Ninety-four to ninety-five per cent of patients underwent diagnostic colonoscopy. Baseline characteristics were balanced. The median insertion time was shorter in LWE group (4.8 min (95% CI: 3.2-6.2)) than those in WWE (7.5 min (95% CI: 6.0-10.3)) and AI (6.4 min (95% CI: 4.2-9.8)) (both p < 0.001) groups. The cecal intubation rates in unsedated patients of the two water exchange methods (WWE 99%, LWE 99%) were significantly higher than that (89.8%) in AI group (p = 0.01). The final success rates were comparable among the three groups after sedation was given. Maximum pain scores and number of patients needing abdominal compression between WWE and LWE groups were comparable, both lower than those in AI group (p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed regarding PDR, although the PDR in right colon tended to be higher in WWE group. Conclusion: By preserving the benefits of WWE and reducing insertion time, LWE is appropriate for diagnostic colonoscopy, especially in settings with tight scheduling of patients. The higher PDR in the right colon in WWE group deserves to be further investigated.

TI  - Urology: a trip into metaverse
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeMetaverse is becoming an alternative world in which technology and virtual experiences are mixed with real life, and it holds the promise of changing our way of living. Healthcare is already changing thanks to Metaverse and its numerous applications. In particular, Urology and urologic patients can benefit in many ways from Metaverse.MethodsA non-systematic literature review identified recently published studies dealing with Metaverse. The database used for this review was PubMed, and the identified studies served as the base for a narrative analysis of the literature that explored the use of Metaverse in Urology.ResultsVirtual consultations can enhance access to care and reduce distance and costs, and pain management and rehabilitation can find an incredible support in virtual reality, reducing anxiety and stress and improving adherence to therapy. Metaverse has the biggest potential in urologic surgery, where it can revolutionize both surgery planning, with 3D modeling and virtual surgeries, and intraoperatively, with augmented reality and artificial intelligence. Med Schools can implement Metaverse in anatomy and surgery lectures, providing an immersive environment for learning, and residents can use this platform for learning in a safe space at their own pace. However, there are also potential challenges and ethical concerns associated with the use of the metaverse in healthcare.ConclusionsThis paper provides an overview of the concept of the metaverse, its potential applications, challenges, and opportunities, and discusses the implications of its development in Urology.

TI  - Auditory stimulation and deep learning predict awakening from coma after cardiac arrest
T2  - BRAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the integrity of neural functions in coma after cardiac arrest remains an open challenge. Prognostication of coma outcome relies mainly on visual expert scoring of physiological signals, which is prone to subjectivity and leaves a considerable number of patients in a 'grey zone', with uncertain prognosis. Quantitative analysis of EEG responses to auditory stimuli can provide a window into neural functions in coma and information about patients' chances of awakening. However, responses to standardized auditory stimulation are far from being used in a clinical routine due to heterogeneous and cumbersome protocols. Here, we hypothesize that convolutional neural networks can assist in extracting interpretable patterns of EEG responses to auditory stimuli during the first day of coma that are predictive of patients' chances of awakening and survival at 3 months. We used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to model single-trial EEG responses to auditory stimuli in the first day of coma, under standardized sedation and targeted temperature management, in a multicentre and multiprotocol patient cohort and predict outcome at 3 months. The use of CNNs resulted in a positive predictive power for predicting awakening of 0.83 +/- 0.04 and 0.81 +/- 0.06 and an area under the curve in predicting outcome of 0.69 +/- 0.05 and 0.70 +/- 0.05, for patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia and normothermia, respectively. These results also persisted in a subset of patients that were in a clinical 'grey zone'. The network's confidence in predicting outcome was based on interpretable features: it strongly correlated to the neural synchrony and complexity of EEG responses and was modulated by independent clinical evaluations, such as the EEG reactivity, background burst-suppression or motor responses. Our results highlight the strong potential of interpretable deep learning algorithms in combination with auditory stimulation to improve prognostication of coma outcome.

T2  - PROGRESS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND PATTERN RECOGNITION
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition (IWAIPR)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Peripheral Nerve Blocking (PNB) is a regional anesthesia procedure that delivers an anesthetic in the proximity of a nerve to avoid nociceptive transmission. Anesthesiologists have widely used ultrasound images to guide the PNB due to their low cost, non-invasivity, and lack of radiation. Due to the difficulties in visually locating the target nerve, automatic nerve segmentation systems attempt to support the specialist to perform a successful nerve block. This work introduces a deep neural network for automatic nerve segmentation in ultrasound images. The proposed approach consists of a conditioned U-Net model that includes the kind of target nerve as a second input allowing the network to learn new features to improve the segmentation. The model is trained and tested on a dataset holding four different peripheral nerves, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 0.70. Results show that the proposed C-UNet outperforms the conventional U-Net, benefiting the ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia.

AB  - Ultrasound guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) is the Regional Anesthesia (RA) technique of injecting the anesthetic in required amounts depending on the region to be covered using ultrasound images of patients. It is one of the fields which is steadfastly growing in medical imaging, providing advances in ultrasound imaging technology. However, nerve identification continues to remain as one of the most challenging tasks that anesthetists can encounter in the UGRA technique of injection. One of the main reasons of this include the low quality of the ultrasound images which are affected by the introduction of unwanted speckle noise. Since, Regional anesthesia (RA) is one of most frequently undertaken tasks in hospitals throughout the world to reduce or nullify the effect of the persistent pain in patients, any discrepancy in providing anesthesia can lead to severe damage to the respective region of the body or side effects to the rest of the body and also to the life of the patient. This enhances the need for correctly identifying the right nerve region to provide anesthesia. In this paper, we survey the conventional methods [1] used in biomedical image processing. For each stage of the processing, we have performed comparison with the different methodologies and we propose a combination of the methods which gives the best performance.

TI  - Prediction of Differential Pharmacologic Response in Chronic Pain Using Functional Neuroimaging Biomarkers and a Support Vector Machine Algorithm: An Exploratory Study
T2  - ARTHRITIS & RHEUMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective There is increasing demand for prediction of chronic pain treatment outcomes using machine-learning models, in order to improve suboptimal pain management. In this exploratory study, we used baseline brain functional connectivity patterns from chronic pain patients with fibromyalgia (FM) to predict whether a patient would respond differentially to either milnacipran or pregabalin, 2 drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of FM. Methods FM patients participated in 2 separate double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies, one evaluating milnacipran (n = 15) and one evaluating pregabalin (n = 13). Functional magnetic resonance imaging during rest was performed before treatment to measure intrinsic functional brain connectivity in several brain regions involved in pain processing. A support vector machine algorithm was used to classify FM patients as responders, defined as those with a >= 20% improvement in clinical pain, to either milnacipran or pregabalin. Results Connectivity patterns involving the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) individually classified pregabalin responders versus milnacipran responders with 77% accuracy. Performance of this classification improved when both PCC and DLPFC connectivity patterns were combined, resulting in a 92% classification accuracy. These results were not related to confounding factors, including head motion, scanner sequence, or hardware status. Connectivity patterns failed to differentiate drug nonresponders across the 2 studies. Conclusion Our findings indicate that brain functional connectivity patterns used in a machine-learning framework differentially predict clinical response to pregabalin and milnacipran in patients with chronic pain. These findings highlight the promise of machine learning in pain prognosis and treatment prediction.

TI  - Comparison of intraoperative cortisol levels after preoperative hydrocortisone administration versus placebo in patients without adrenal insufficiency undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal removal of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas: a double-blind randomized trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE In this double-blind randomized trial, the necessity of preoperative steroid administration in patients without adrenal insufficiency (AI) undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (ETSS) for pituitary adenoma was evaluated.METHODS Forty patients with and without AI, defined as a peak cortisol level > 18 & micro;g/dl on the insulin tolerance test or rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test, undergoing ETSS for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas were randomly allocated to treatment with either 100 mg of preoperative hydrocortisone (group HC, n = 20) or normal saline (group C, n = 20). The patients with pituitary apoplexy, the use of a drug within the last 3 months that could affect the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis, or a previous history of brain or adrenal surgery were excluded. Intraoperative cortisol and ACTH levels were measured after anesthesia induction, dura incision, and tumor removal, and at the end of surgery. Intraoperative hypotension, early postoperative AI, and postoperative 3-month pituitary function were investigated.RESULTS Intraoperative serum cortisol levels were significantly higher in the HC group than in the C group after anes- thesia induction (median 69.0 & micro;g/dl [IQR 62.2-89.6 & micro;g/dl] vs 12.7 & micro;g/dl [IQR 8.4-18.2 & micro;g/dl], median difference 57.5 & micro;g/ dl [95% CI 33.0-172.9 & micro;g/dl]), after dura incision (median 53.2 & micro;g/dl [IQR 44.9-63.8 & micro;g/dl] vs 6.4 [IQR 4.8-9.2 & micro;g/dl], median difference 46.6 & micro;g/dl [95% CI 13.3-89.2 & micro;g/dl]), after tumor removal (median 49.5 & micro;g/dl [IQR 43.6-62.4 & micro;g/dl] vs 9.2 & micro;g/dl [IQR 5.75-16.7 & micro;g/dl], median difference 39.4 & micro;g/dl [95% CI 0.3-78.1 & micro;g/dl]), and at the end of surgery (me- dian 46.9 & micro;g/dl [IQR 40.1-63.4 & micro;g/dl] vs 16.9 & micro;g/dl [IQR 12.1-23.2 & micro;g/dl], median difference 32.2 & micro;g/dl [95% CI & minus;42.0 to 228.1 & micro;g/dl]). Serum ACTH levels were significantly lower in group HC than in group C after anesthesia induction (me- dian 3.9 pmol/L [IQR 1.7-5.2 pmol/L] vs 6.9 pmol/L [IQR 3.9-11.9 pmol/L], p = 0.007). No patient showed intraoperative hypotension due to AI. Early postoperative AI was observed in 3 and 5 patients in groups HC and C, respectively. The postoperative 3-month pituitary hormone outcomes including ACTH deficiency were not different between groups.CONCLUSIONS Preoperative steroid administration may be unnecessary in patients without AI undergoing ETSS for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. However, a further large-scale study is needed to determine whether preoperative steroid administration has a significant impact on clinically meaningful events such as perioperative AI and postoperative 3-month ACTH deficiency in these patients.

TI  - Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - AbstractContinuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgeryand in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs(e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, whichmakes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy.However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causespatient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 bloodstream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associatedwith a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-linerisks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only asmall portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc)monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individualrooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work todisconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care”monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnectingsensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portableECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has beenachieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We willdevelop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs forcontinuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form anovel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a-line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, andseamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. Theproposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will providemajor steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring.

TI  - Electroencephalogram Signatures of Agitation Induced by Sevoflurane and Its Association With Genetic Polymorphisms
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Volatile anesthetic-induced agitation, also called paradoxical excitation, is not uncommon during anesthesia induction. Clinically, patients with agitation may lead to self-injury or disrupt the operative position, increasing the incidence of perioperative adverse events. The study was designed to investigate clinical features of sevoflurane-induced agitation and examined whether any gene polymorphisms can potentially be used to predict agitation.Methods: One hundred seventy-six patients underwent anesthesia induction with sevoflurane were included in this study. Frontal electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and hemodynamics were recorded continuously during anesthesia induction. DNA samples were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium Asian Screening Array and the SNaPshot technology. Genetic association was analyzed by genome-wide association study. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the role of variables in the prediction of agitation.Results: Twenty-five (14.2%) patients experienced agitation. The depth of anesthesia index (Ai index) (p < 0.001), EMG (p < 0.001), heart rate (HR) (p < 0.001), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (p < 0.001) rapidly increased during the agitation. EEG exhibited a shift toward high frequencies with spikes during agitation. The fast waves (alpha and beta) were more pronounced and the slow rhythms (delta) were less prominent during the occurrence of agitation. Moreover, three SNPs in the methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) gene were correlated to the susceptibility to agitation (p < 5.0 x 10(-6)). Carrying rs1801394 A > G (odds ratio 3.50, 95% CI 1.43-9.45) and/or rs2307116 G > A (3.31, 1.36-8.95) predicted a higher risk of agitation.Discussion: This study suggests that the agitation/paradoxical excitation induced by sevoflurane is characterized as increases in Ai index, EMG, HR and MAP, and the high frequency with spikes in EEG. Moreover, our results provide preliminary evidence for MTRR genetic polymorphisms, involving folate metabolism function, may be related to the susceptibility to agitation.

AB  - Maintaining anesthetic states using automated brain-state prediction systems is expected to reduce drug overdosage and associated side-effects. However, commercially available brain-state monitoring systems perform poorly on drug-class combinations. We assume that current automated brain-state prediction systems perform poorly because they do not account for brain-state dynamics that are unique to drug-class combinations. In this work, we develop a k-nearest neighbors model to test whether improvements to automated brain-state prediction of drug-class combinations are feasible. We utilize electroencephalogram data collected from human subjects who received general anesthesia with sevoflurane and general anesthesia with the drug-class combination of sevoflurane-plus-ketamine. We demonstrate improved performance predicting anesthesia-induced brain-states using drug-specific models.

Based on the concept of coprotection of heart and brain, this study attempts to screen the related factors of early cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction after CEA with the method of machine learning to provide clinical data for the prevention of postoperative cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction. Methods. 443 patients who received CEA operation under general anesthesia within 2 years were collected as the research objects. The demographic data, previous medical history, degree of neck vascular stenosis, blood pressure at all time points during the perioperative period, the time of occlusion, whether to place the shunt, and the time of hospital stay, whether to have cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction were collected. The machine learning model was established, and stable variables were selected based on single-factor analysis. Results. The incidence of cerebral infarction was 1.4% (6/443) and that of myocardial infarction was 2.3% (10/443). The hospitalization time of patients with cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction was longer than that of the control group (8 (7, 15) days vs. 7 (5, 8) days, P=0.002). The stable related factors were screened out by the xgboost model. The importance score (F score) was as follows: average arterial pressure during occlusion was 222 points, body mass index was 159 points, average arterial pressure postoperation was 156 points, the standard deviation of systolic pressure during occlusion was 153 points, diastolic pressure during occlusion was 146 points, mean arterial pressure after entry was 143 points, systolic pressure during occlusion was 121 points, and age was 117 points. Conclusion. Eight factors, such as blood pressure, body mass index, and age, may be related to the postoperative cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction in patients with CEA. The machine learning method deserves further study.

TI  - I-Corps: Algorithm to detect stroke during cardiovascular surgery and reduce the time to effective clinical intervention
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to detect stroke during surgery and reduce the time to effective clinical interventions. Available approved, lifesaving, mechanical clot removal therapy is not routinely administered for stroke due to delays in detection. This delay has prompted the recommendation of neuromonitoring to detect strokes. Currently, in high-risk cardiovascular surgery, a trained neurologist visually monitors electroencephalogram (EEG) signals continuously and applies empirical criteria to detect cerebral ischemia and stroke. However, such visual monitoring can be mentally demanding, variable in quality, and limiting in scalability for the neurologist who monitors many surgeries.  Despite the availability of EEG devices, they are not universally available at all medical institutions. There is a clear need for scalable solutions that can support the neurologist to improve stroke detection and the administration of timely lifesaving therapies.  Successful development of this project may translate to widespread adoption of neuromonitoring in surgery for not only stroke but spinal cord and peripheral nerve injuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops a software system that can display intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and use machine learning (ML) to detect stroke and alert the monitoring neurologist in real-time. An artificial intelligence software system with ML capabilities can meaningfully process massive sets of data quickly, accurately, and symbiotically work alongside clinicians.  The system relies on ML models using EEG, and clinical and anesthesia data collected during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The initial ML models can also be used to detect ischemia, a precursor of stroke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

TI  - Machine learning-based feature combination analysis for odor-dependent hemodynamic responses of rat olfactory bulb
T2  - BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rodents have a well-developed sense of smell and are used to detect explosives, mines, illegal substances, hidden currency, and contraband, but it is impossible to keep their concentration constantly. Therefore, there is an ongoing effort to infer odors detected by animals without behavioral readings with brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. However, the invasive BCI technique has the disadvantage that long-term studies are limited by the immune response and electrode movement. On the other hand, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based BCI technology is a non-invasive method that can measure neuronal activity without worrying about the immune response or electrode movement. This study confirmed that the NIRS-based BCI technology can be used as an odor detection and identification from the rat olfactory system. In addition, we tried to present features optimized for machine learning models by extracting six features, such as slopes, peak, variance, mean, kurtosis, and skewness, from the hemodynamic response, and analyzing the importance of individuals or combinations. As a result, the feature with the highest F1-Score was indicated as slopes, and it was investigated that the combination of the features including slopes and mean was the most important for odor inference. On the other hand, the inclusion of other features with a low correlation with slopes had a positive effect on the odor inference, but most of them resulted in insignificant or rather poor performance. The results presented in this paper are expected to serve as a basis for suggesting the development direction of the hemodynamic response-based bionic nose in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical effects of different anesthesia methods in lateral episiotomy. Providing the guidance of choosing the appropriate anesthesia method in clinical operation.METHODS: A total of 300 primiparas with vaginal delivery were enrolled into this study. These primiparas were divided into three groups (n=100, each), according to the different methods of anesthesia: group A (pudendal nerve block anesthesia + stepwise dissection and incisional local anesthesia), group B (bilateral pudendal nerve block anesthesia), and group C (pudendal nerve block anesthesia + local infiltration anesthesia). The pain score of these primiparas at the time of perineal dissection and suturing, as well as suturing time and bleeding volume, were observed and compared among these three groups.RESULTS: In respect of pain scores at the time of suturing in lateral episiotomy, maternal pain score was significantly lower in group A than in groups B and C; and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). In respect of the time required for suturing in lateral episiotomy, suturing time was shorter in group A than in groups B and C; and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). In respect of the bleeding volume in lateral episiotomy, maternal bleeding volume was lesser in group A than in groups B and C; and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Among these three commonly used methods of anesthesia in lateral episiotomy, the pudendal nerve block anesthesia + stepwise dissection and incisional local anesthesia method used in group A had the best analgesic effect, the shortest suturing time, and the lowest wound blood loss.
