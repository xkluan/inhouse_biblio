TI  - General anesthesia enhances lesion quality and ablation efficiency of 
      circumferential pulmonary vein isolation.
PG  - 76-82
LID - 10.1002/joa3.12960 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is the cornerstone of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) ablation. General anesthesia (GA) resolves the problem of pain 
      intolerability and provides regular respiratory mode which might improve the 
      catheter maneuverability of AF ablation. This study aims to compare the 
      procedural performance of PVI under GA versus conscious sedation (CS) from 
      multiple perspectives. METHODS: A total of 36 consecutive patients undergoing 
      first AF ablation under GA were enrolled in GA group. Another 109 patients 
      receiving AF ablation under CS in the same period were selected as the control 
      group. After propensity score matching, 29 matched pairs with similar baseline 
      characteristics were available for further analysis. The AIFV (using AI to 
      analyze the raw data from CARTO3 system) system was used to evaluate six 
      procedural parameters in each PVI procedure. RESULTS: Compared with CS, PVI under 
      GA had a significantly shorter total PVI time (51.4 min vs. 67.8 min; p = .003) 
      and higher radiofrequency ratio (62.6% vs. 55.8%; p = .032). The number of gaps 
      (1.0 vs. 3.0; p < .001) and the rate of break point were significantly lower in 
      the GA group. GA was also associated with a higher effective ablation-index ratio 
      (87.5% vs. 74.1%; p < .001) and effective force-over-time ratio (85.3% vs. 69.2%; 
      p = .001). After a medium follow-up time of 24 months, 12/29 (41.4%) patients in 
      the CS group and 6/29 (20.7%) patients in the GA group suffered from AF 
      recurrence (p = .156). CONCLUSIONS: GA improves the lesion quality and procedural 
      efficiency of PVI from multiple perspectives evaluated by the AIFV system.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we were aimed to identify important variables via 
      machine learning algorithms and predict postoperative delirium (POD) occurrence 
      in older patients. METHODS: This study was to make the secondary analysis of data 
      from a randomized controlled trial. The Boruta function was used to screen 
      relevant basic characteristic variables. Four models including Logistic 
      Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), the Classification and Regression Tree 
      (CART), and Random Forest (RF) were established from the data set using repeated 
      cross validation, hyper-parameter optimization, and Smote technique (Synthetic 
      minority over-sampling technique, Smote), with the calculation of confusion 
      matrix parameters and the plotting of Receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (ROC), Precision recall curve (PRC), and partial dependence graph for further 
      analysis and evaluation. RESULTS: The basic characteristic variables resulting 
      from Boruta screening included grouping, preoperative Mini-Mental State 
      Examination(MMSE), CHARLSON score, preoperative HCT, preoperative serum 
      creatinine, intraoperative bleeding volume, intraoperative urine volume, 
      anesthesia duration, operation duration, postoperative morphine dosage, intensive 
      care unit (ICU) duration, tracheal intubation duration, and 7-day postoperative 
      rest and move pain score (median and max; VAS-Rest-M, VAS-Move-M, VAS-Rest-Max, 
      and VAS-Move-Max). And Random Forest (RF) showed the best performance in the 
      testing set among the 4 models with Accuracy: 0.9878; Matthews correlation 
      coefficient (MCC): 0.8763; Area under ROC curve (AUC-ROC): 1.0; Area under the 
      PRC Curve (AUC-PRC): 1.0. CONCLUSION: A high-performance algorithm was 
      established and verified in this study demonstrating the degree of POD risk 
      changes in perioperative elderly patients. And the major risk factors for the 
      development of POD were CREA and VAS-Move-Max.

TI  - Antinociceptive Effects of Cannabichromene (CBC) in Mice: Insights from von Frey, 
      Tail-Flick, Formalin, and Acetone Tests.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines12010083 [doi]
LID - 83
AB  - Cannabis sativa contains minor cannabinoids that have potential therapeutic value 
      in pain management. However, detailed experimental evidence for the 
      antinociceptive effects of many of these minor cannabinoids remains lacking. 
      Here, we employed artificial intelligence (AI) to perform compound-protein 
      interaction estimates with cannabichromene (CBC) and receptors involved in 
      nociceptive signaling. Based on our findings, we investigated the antinociceptive 
      properties of CBC in naïve or neuropathic C57BL/6 male and female mice using von 
      Frey (mechanical allodynia), tail-flick (noxious radiant heat), formalin (acute 
      and persistent inflammatory pain), and acetone (cold thermal) tests. For von Frey 
      assessments, CBC dose (0-20 mg/kg, i.p.) and time (0-6 h) responses were measured 
      in male and female neuropathic mice. For tail-flick, formalin, and acetone 
      assays, CBC (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to naïve male and female mice 1 h 
      prior to testing. The results show that CBC (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly 
      reduced mechanical allodynia in neuropathic male and female mice 1-2 h after 
      treatment. Additionally, CBC treatment caused significant reductions in 
      nociceptive behaviors in the tail-flick assay and in both phase 1 and phase 2 of 
      the formalin test. Finally, we found a significant interaction in neuropathic 
      male mice in the acetone test. In conclusion, our results suggest that CBC 
      targets receptors involved in nociceptive signaling and imparts antinociceptive 
      properties that may benefit males and females afflicted with diverse forms of 
      acute or chronic/persistent pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study used machine learning algorithms to identify important 
      variables and predict postinduction hypotension (PIH) in patients undergoing 
      colorectal tumor resection surgery. METHODS: Data from 318 patients who underwent 
      colorectal tumor resection under general anesthesia were analyzed. The training 
      and test sets are divided based on the timeline. The Boruta algorithm was used to 
      screen relevant basic characteristic variables and establish a model for the 
      training set. Four models, regression tree, K-nearest neighbor, neural network, 
      and random forest (RF), were built using repeated cross-validation and 
      hyperparameter optimization. The best model was selected, and a sorting chart of 
      the feature variables, a univariate partial dependency profile, and a breakdown 
      profile were drawn. R(2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), 
      and root MSE (RMSE) were used to plot regression fitting curves for the training 
      and test sets. RESULTS: The basic feature variables associated with the Boruta 
      screening were age, sex, body mass index, L3 skeletal muscle index, and HUAC. In 
      the optimal RF model, R(2) was 0.7708 and 0.7591, MAE was 0.0483 and 0.0408, MSE 
      was 0.0038 and 0.0028, and RMSE was 0.0623 and 0.0534 for the training and test 
      sets, respectively. CONCLUSION: A high-performance algorithm was established and 
      validated to demonstrate the degree of change in blood pressure after induction 
      to control important characteristic variables and reduce PIH occurrence.

AB  - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a type of primary adrenal insufficiency 
      (AI) that predisposes to adrenal crisis (AC) during stress. We describe a case of 
      a primipara with CAH who was admitted in labor. To prevent AC, glucocorticoid 
      replacement was given according to guidelines. Due to fetal decelerations, an 
      emergency C-section was performed under general anesthesia following which 
      refractory hypotension emerged. The diagnosis of AC was considered, and 
      hydrocortisone was given with sustained hemodynamic improvement. AC is a 
      life-threatening emergency whose diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. 
      Despite adequate steroid coverage, additional stressors may precipitate AC, so it 
      is of paramount importance that anesthesiologists consider this emergency.

TI  - Identification of Anesthetic-Induced Cardiovascular Biomarkers in Off-Pump 
      Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery Using Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network 
      Analysis and Machine Learning.
PG  - E740-E754

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to select anesthesia-induced zinc finger 
      protein-related gene biomarkers that predict cardiovascular function during 
      off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG). METHODS: Gene expression data 
      from GSE4386 included 20 post-anesthesia and 20 pre-anesthesia atrial tissue 
      samples. Zinc finger protein-related genes (ZFPRGs) were searched in the UniProt 
      database and anesthesia-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
      identified Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to 
      screen hub genes, and three machine learning algorithms were used to further 
      screen for cardiovascular biomarkers. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using a 
      nomogram model. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to analyze the pathways 
      enriched by the biomarkers. A microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA-transcription factor (TF) 
      regulatory network was established to explore the potential regulatory mechanisms 
      of these biomarkers. Disease-related drugs were predicted using the Comparative 
      Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). RESULTS: A total of 1102 cardioprotection-related 
      DEGs were selected between the pre- and post-anesthesia groups. Additionally, 
      1095 hub genes were obtained based on WGCNA, and 2274 ZFPRGs were downloaded from 
      the UniProt database. After Venn analysis and machine learning, ZNF420, RNF135, 
      and BNC2 were selected as cardioprotection-related zinc finger biomarkers during 
      OPCABG. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and nomogram models 
      confirmed the diagnostic value and accuracy of the three cardioprotective 
      biomarkers. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that ZNF420 is involved in the 
      cell cycle and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. RNF135 and BNC2 were enriched in the 
      oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In the constructed miRNA-mRNA-TF network, 
      miR-182-5p and miR-16-5p simultaneously regulated three cardioprotective 
      biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Three cardioprotection-related zinc finger protein 
      biomarkers (ZNF420, RNF135, and BNC2) were identified using OPCABG samples.

      The emergence of AI in healthcare sets the stage for a comprehensive analysis of 
      its applications in anesthesia. In the preoperative phase, AI facilitates 
      personalized risk assessments and decision support, optimizing anesthesia 
      planning and drug dosage predictions. Moving to the intraoperative phase, we 
      delve into AI's role in monitoring and control through sophisticated anesthesia 
      monitoring and closed-loop systems. Additionally, we discuss the integration of 
      robotics and AI-guided procedures, revolutionizing surgical assistance. 
      Transitioning to the postoperative phase, we explore AI-driven postoperative 
      monitoring, predictive analysis for complications, and the integration of AI into 
      rehabilitation programs and long-term follow-up. These new applications redefine 
      patient recovery, emphasizing personalized care and proactive interventions. 
      However, the integration of AI in anesthesia poses challenges and ethical 
      considerations. Data security, interpretability, and bias in AI algorithms demand 
      scrutiny. Moreover, the evolving patient-doctor relationship in an AI-driven care 
      landscape requires a delicate balance between efficiency and human touch. Looking 
      forward, we discuss the future directions of AI in anesthesia, anticipating 
      advances in technology and AI algorithms. The integration of AI into routine 
      clinical practice and its potential impact on anesthesia education and training 
      are explored, emphasizing the need for collaboration, education, and ethical 
      guidelines. This review provides a comprehensive overview of AI applications in 
      anesthesia, offering insights into the present landscape, challenges, and future 
      directions. The synthesis of historical perspectives, current applications, and 
      future possibilities underscores the transformative potential of AI in 
      revolutionizing patient care within the dynamic field of anesthesia.

AB  - Medical advancements in the diagnosis, surgical techniques, perioperative care, 
      and continued care throughout childhood have transformed the outlook for 
      individuals with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), improving survival and shifting the 
      perspective towards lifelong care. However, with a growing population of 
      survivors, longstanding challenges have been accentuated, and new challenges have 
      surfaced, necessitating a re-evaluation of TOF care. Availability of prenatal 
      diagnostics, insufficient information from traditional imaging techniques, 
      previously unforeseen medical complications, and debates surrounding optimal 
      timing and indications for reintervention are among the emerging issues. To 
      address these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine 
      learning holds great promise as they have the potential to revolutionize patient 
      management and positively impact lifelong outcomes for individuals with TOF. 
      Innovative applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have 
      spanned across multiple domains of TOF care, including screening and diagnosis, 
      automated image processing and interpretation, clinical risk stratification, and 
      planning and performing cardiac interventions. By embracing these advancements 
      and incorporating them into routine clinical practice, personalized medicine 
      could be delivered, leading to the best possible outcomes for patients. In this 
      review, we provide an overview of these evolving applications and emphasize the 
      challenges, limitations, and future potential for integrating them into clinical 
      care.

      medical fields. The release of a new generation of headsets for medical enhanced 
      VR/AR (MER) opens new possibilities for applications in medicine, particularly in 
      urology, to improve accessibility to everyone. These innovative headsets offer 
      deep immersion without requiring a controller, which represents a novel approach 
      to VR/AR engagement. The potential of these headsets applies to all aspects of 
      urology, including surgical training, virtual meetings, communication between 
      health care providers, patient counseling, telemedicine, delivering patient 
      advice, and pain control. MER has the potential to improve operative planning and 
      enhance intraoperative navigation and spatial awareness. The surgeon's 
      visualization and overall experience can be significantly enhanced via improved 
      guidance and visualization, ultimately leading to greater precision and safety. 
      This cutting-edge technology has the potential to reshape urology practice, 
      communication methods, and medical procedures, and ultimately to improve 
      patients' experience of their urological condition. PATIENT SUMMARY: This mini 
      review explores how a new generation of headsets for medical enhanced virtual 
      reality could revolutionize urology by improving surgical planning, assistance 
      during procedures, and medical education. Patients can benefit from better pain 
      management and a deeper understanding of their conditions. However, challenges 
      such as costs, accuracy, and ethical concerns must be addressed. This technology 
      holds promise for transforming urological practice and patient care.

AB  - Cortical electro-encephalography (EEG) served as the clinical reference for 
      monitoring unconsciousness during general anesthesia. The existing EEG-based 
      monitors classified general anesthesia states as underdosed, adequate, or 
      overdosed, lacking predictive power due to the absence of transition phases among 
      these states. In response to this limitation, we undertook an analysis of the EEG 
      signal during isoflurane-induced general anesthesia in mice. Adopting a 
      data-driven approach, we applied signal processing techniques to track θ- and 
      δ-band dynamics, along with iso-electric suppressions. Combining this approach 
      with machine learning, we successfully developed an automated algorithm. The 
      findings of our study revealed that the dampening of the δ-band occurred several 
      minutes before the onset of significant iso-electric suppression episodes. 
      Furthermore, a distinct γ-frequency oscillation was observed, persisting for 
      several minutes during the recovery phase subsequent to isoflurane-induced 
      overdose. As a result of our research, we generated a map summarizing multiple 
      brain states and their transitions, offering a tool for predicting and preventing 
      overdose during general anesthesia. The transition phases identified, along with 
      the developed algorithm, have the potential to be generalized, enabling 
      clinicians to prevent inadequate anesthesia and, consequently, tailor anesthetic 
      regimens to individual patients.

TI  - The effect of technical filtering and clinical criteria on alert rates from 
      continuous vital sign monitoring in the general ward.
PG  - 295-302

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Continuous vital sign monitoring at the general hospital ward has 
      major potential advantages over intermittent monitoring but generates many alerts 
      with risk of alert fatigue. We hypothesized that the number of alerts would 
      decrease using different filters. METHODS: This study was an exploratory analysis 
      of the alert reducing effect from adding two different filters to continuously 
      collected vital sign data (peripheral oxygen saturation, blood pressure, heart 
      rate, and respiratory rate) in patients admitted after major surgery or severe 
      medical disease. Filtered data were compared to data without artifact removal. 
      Filter one consists of artifact removal, filter two consists of artifact removal 
      plus duration criteria adjusted for severity of vital sign deviation. Alert 
      thresholds were based on the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) threshold. 
      RESULTS: A population of 716 patients admitted for severe medical disease or 
      major surgery with continuous wireless vital sign monitoring at the general ward 
      with a mean monitoring time of 75.8 h, were included for the analysis. Without 
      artifact removal, we found a median of 137 [IQR: 87-188] alerts per patient/day, 
      artifact removal resulted in a median of 101 [IQR: 56-160] alerts per patient/day 
      and with artifact removal combined with a duration-severity criterion, we found a 
      median of 19 [IQR: 9-34] alerts per patient/day. Reduction of alerts was 86.4% 
      (p < 0.001) for values without artifact removal (137 alerts) vs. the duration 
      criteria and a reduction (19 alerts) of 81.5% (p < 0.001) for the criteria with 
      artifact removal (101 alerts) vs. the duration criteria (19 alerts). CONCLUSION: 
      We conclude that a combination of artifact removal and duration-severity criteria 
      approach substantially reduces alerts generated by continuous vital sign 
      monitoring.

TI  - Utilizing Artificial Intelligence and Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer to 
      Answer Questions About Clinical Scenarios in Neuroanesthesiology.
LID - 10.1097/ANA.0000000000000949 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We tested the ability of chat generative pretrained transformer 
      (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence chatbot, to answer questions relevant to 
      scenarios covered in 3 clinical guidelines, published by the Society for 
      Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care (SNACC), which has published 
      management guidelines: endovascular treatment of stroke, perioperative stroke 
      (Stroke), and care of patients undergoing complex spine surgery (Spine). METHODS: 
      Four neuroanesthesiologists independently assessed whether ChatGPT could apply 52 
      high-quality recommendations (HQRs) included in the 3 SNACC guidelines. HQRs were 
      deemed present in the ChatGPT responses if noted by at least 3 of the 4 
      reviewers. Reviewers also identified incorrect references, potentially harmful 
      recommendations, and whether ChatGPT cited the SNACC guidelines. RESULTS: The 
      overall reviewer agreement for the presence of HQRs in the ChatGPT answers ranged 
      from 0% to 100%. Only 4 of 52 (8%) HQRs were deemed present by at least 3 of the 
      4 reviewers after 5 generic questions, and 23 (44%) HQRs were deemed present 
      after at least 1 additional targeted question. Potentially harmful 
      recommendations were identified for each of the 3 clinical scenarios and ChatGPT 
      failed to cite the SNACC guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The ChatGPT answers were open 
      to human interpretation regarding whether the responses included the HQRs. Though 
      targeted questions resulted in the inclusion of more HQRs than generic questions, 
      fewer than 50% of HQRs were noted even after targeted questions. This suggests 
      that ChatGPT should not currently be considered a reliable source of information 
      for clinical decision-making. Future iterations of ChatGPT may refine algorithms 
      to improve its reliability as a source of clinical information.

TI  - Circle packing charts generated by ChatGPT to identify the characteristics of 
      articles by anesthesiology authors in 2022: Bibliometric analysis.
PG  - e34511
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000034511 [doi]
LID - e34511
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ChatGPT (Open AI, San Francisco, CA), denoted by the Chat 
      Generative Pretrained Transformer, has been a hot topic for discussion over the 
      past few months. A verification of whether the code for drawing circle packing 
      charts (CPCs) with R can be generated by ChatGPT and used to identify 
      characteristics of articles by anesthesiology authors is needed. This study aimed 
      to provide insights into article characteristics in the field of anesthesiology 
      and to highlight the potential of ChatGPT for data visualization techniques 
      (e.g., CPCs) in bibliometric analysis. METHODS: A total of 23,012 articles were 
      indexed in PubMed in 2022 by authors in the field of anesthesiology. The code for 
      drawing CPCs with R was generated by ChatGPT and then modified by the authors to 
      identify the characteristics of articles in 2 forms: 23,012 and 100 top-impact 
      factors in journals (T100IF). Using CPCs and 3 other visualizations-network 
      charts, impact beam plots, and Sankey diagrams-we were able to display article 
      features commonly used in bibliometric analysis. The author-weighted scheme and 
      absolute advantage coefficient were used to assess dominant entities, such as 
      countries, institutes, authors, and themes (defined by PubMed and MeSH terms). 
      RESULTS: Our findings indicate that: further modifications should be made to the 
      code generated by ChatGPT for drawing CPCs in R; publications in the field of 
      anesthesiology are dominated by China, followed by the United States and Japan; 
      Capital Medical University (China) and Showa University Hospital (Japan) dominate 
      research institutes in terms of publications and IF, respectively; and COVID-19 
      is the most frequently reported theme in T100IF, accounting for 29%. CONCLUSIONS: 
      No such articles with CPCs regarding bibliometrics have ever been found in 
      PubMed. The code for drawing CPCs with R can be generated by ChatGPT, but further 
      modification is required for implementation in bibliometrics. CPCs should be used 
      in future studies to identify the characteristics of articles in other areas of 
      research rather than limiting them to anesthesiology, as we did in this study.

TI  - Impact of wrist-ankle acupuncture on propofol dosage under the dual monitoring of 
      density spectrum array and anesthesia consciousness index in elderly patients 
      undergoing urologic surgery: a sham-controlled randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 1686-1696
LID - 10.21037/tau-23-301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Propofol is a widely used intravenous anesthetic in clinic. However, 
      it is easy to cause serious circulatory fluctuation in elderly patients, so the 
      dose should be reduced as appropriate. Studies have shown that wrist-ankle 
      acupuncture (WAA) can reduce the dosage of propofol in patients undergoing 
      painless endoscopy. Unfortunately, there is no report on whether WAA will reduce 
      the dosage of propofol when used for anesthesia in elderly patients. The purpose 
      of this study is to observe the effect of WAA on propofol dosage in elderly 
      patients, and to provide a new method for maintaining circulatory stability in 
      elderly patients under general anesthesia. METHODS: From October 2022 to December 
      2022, Hebei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine was selected. 
      Forty-four elderly patients undergoing general anesthesia in urology department 
      were randomly divided into two groups according to the complete random method 
      with WAA group, consisting of 22 individuals, and non-WAA (NWAA) group, also 
      consisting of 22 individuals. Both groups were treated with WAA or false needle 
      acupuncture at the same site before anesthesia, respectively, and the needle was 
      kept until the operation was finished. During the operation, the dosage of 
      propofol was adjusted according to the depth of field monitoring density spectrum 
      array (DSA) and anesthesia consciousness index (Ai) with anesthesia monitor. 
      RESULTS: A total of 44 patients participated in this study, and all of them 
      completed the experiment. There were no significant difference in sex, age, 
      height, weight, duration of anesthesia, liver and kidney function, score of Fried 
      frailty scale, activity of daily living (ADL), age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity 
      index (aCCI) and mini-cognitive test (Mini-Cog) between the two groups (P>0.05), 
      but the total dose of propofol (WAA =121.5, NWAA =170.5) mg and maintenance dose 
      (WAA =1.02±0.55, NWAA =1.76±0.67) mg/kg/h, utilization rate of vasoactive drugs 
      during operation, recovery time after anesthesia (WAA =2, NWAA =3) min and 
      surgeon satisfaction (WAA =9, NWAA =8.5) had significant differences (P<0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with NWAA group, WAA group could reduce the dosage of 
      propofol in anesthesia for elderly patients with exocrine secretion and was 
      beneficial to circulatory stability. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial 
      Registry (ID: ChiCTR2100054132).

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the current 
      research and critically examine artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and 
      their applicability to the daily practice of anesthesiologists. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Novel AI tools are developed using data from electronic health records, imaging, 
      waveforms, clinical notes, and wearables. These tools can accurately predict the 
      perioperative risk for adverse outcomes, the need for blood transfusion, and the 
      risk of difficult intubation. Intraoperatively, AI models can assist with 
      technical skill augmentation, patient monitoring, and management. 
      Postoperatively, AI technology can aid in preventing complications and discharge 
      planning. While further prospective validation is needed, these early 
      applications demonstrate promise in every area of perioperative care. SUMMARY: 
      The practice of anesthesiology is at a precipice fueled by technological 
      innovation. The clinical AI implementation would enable personalized and safer 
      patient care by offering actionable insights from the wealth of perioperative 
      data.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cancer Related Pain: A Systematic 
      Review.
LID - 2023.12.06.23299610 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299610 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Pain is a challenging multifaceted symptom reported by most 
      cancer patients, resulting in a substantial burden on both patients and 
      healthcare systems. This systematic review aims to explore applications of 
      artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) in predicting pain-related 
      outcomes and supporting decision-making processes in pain management in cancer. 
      METHODS: A comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science 
      databases was conducted using terms including "Cancer", "Pain", "Pain 
      Management", "Analgesics", "Opioids", "Artificial Intelligence", "Machine 
      Learning", "Deep Learning", and "Neural Networks" published up to September 7, 
      2023. The screening process was performed using the Covidence screening tool. 
      Only original studies conducted in human cohorts were included. AI/ML models, 
      their validation and performance and adherence to TRIPOD guidelines were 
      summarized from the final included studies. RESULTS: This systematic review 
      included 44 studies from 2006-2023. Most studies were prospective and 
      uni-institutional. There was an increase in the trend of AI/ML studies in cancer 
      pain in the last 4 years. Nineteen studies used AI/ML for classifying cancer 
      patients' pain development after cancer therapy, with median AUC 0.80 (range 
      0.76-0.94). Eighteen studies focused on cancer pain research with median AUC 0.86 
      (range 0.50-0.99), and 7 focused on applying AI/ML for cancer pain management 
      decisions with median AUC 0.71 (range 0.47-0.89). Multiple ML models were 
      investigated with. median AUC across all models in all studies (0.77). Random 
      forest models demonstrated the highest performance (median AUC 0.81), lasso 
      models had the highest median sensitivity (1), while Support Vector Machine had 
      the highest median specificity (0.74). Overall adherence of included studies to 
      TRIPOD guidelines was 70.7%. Lack of external validation (14%) and clinical 
      application (23%) of most included studies was detected. Reporting of model 
      calibration was also missing in the majority of studies (5%). CONCLUSION: 
      Implementation of various novel AI/ML tools promises significant advances in the 
      classification, risk stratification, and management decisions for cancer pain. 
      These advanced tools will integrate big health-related data for personalized pain 
      management in cancer patients. Further research focusing on model calibration and 
      rigorous external clinical validation in real healthcare settings is imperative 
      for ensuring its practical and reliable application in clinical practice.

TI  - Exploring phenotype-based ventilator parameter optimization to mitigate 
      postoperative pulmonary complications: a retrospective observational cohort 
      study.
LID - 10.1007/s00595-023-02785-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify tidal volume (V(T)) and positive end-expiratory pressure 
      (PEEP) associated with the lowest incidence and severity of postoperative 
      pulmonary complications (PPCs) for each phenotype based on preoperative 
      characteristics. METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective observational cohort 
      study were 34,910 adults who underwent surgery, using general anesthesia with 
      mechanical ventilation. Initially, the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
      operator regression was employed to select relevant preoperative characteristics. 
      Then, the classification and regression tree (CART) was built to identify 
      phenotypes. Finally, we computed the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curves from logistic regressions to identify V(T) and PEEP 
      associated with the lowest incidence and severity of PPCs for each phenotype. 
      RESULTS: CARTs classified seven phenotypes for each outcome. A probability of the 
      development of PPCs ranged from the lowest (3.51%) to the highest (68.57%), 
      whereas the probability of the development of the highest level of PPC severity 
      ranged from 3.3% to 91.0%. Across all phenotypes, the V(T) and PEEP associated 
      with the most desirable outcomes were within a small range of V(T) 7-8 ml/kg 
      predicted body weight with PEEP of between 6 and 8 cmH(2)O. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      ranges of optimal V(T) and PEEP were small, regardless of the phenotypes, which 
      had a wide range of risk profiles.

TI  - Assessing the Utility of a Machine-Learning Model to Assist With the Assignment 
      of the American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status Classification in 
      Pediatric Patients.
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000006761 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 
      Classification System (ASA-PS) is used to classify patients' health before 
      delivering an anesthetic. Assigning an ASA-PS Classification score to pediatric 
      patients can be challenging due to the vast array of chronic conditions present 
      in the pediatric population. The specific aims of this study were to (1) suggest 
      an ASA-PS score for pediatric patients undergoing elective surgical procedures 
      using machine-learning (ML) methods; and (2) assess the impact of presenting the 
      suggested ASA-PS score to clinicians when making their final ASA-PS assignment. 
      The intent was not to create a new ASA-PS score but to use ML methods to generate 
      a suggested score, along with information on how the score was generated (ie, 
      historical information on patient comorbidities) to assist clinicians when 
      assigning their final ASA-PS score. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 146,784 
      pediatric surgical encounters from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019, using 
      eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) methods to predict ASA-PS scores using 
      patients' age, weight, and chronic conditions. SHapley Additive exPlanations 
      (SHAP) were used to assess patient characteristics that contributed most to the 
      predicted ASA-PS scores. The predicted ASA-PS model was presented to a 
      prospective cohort study of 28,677 surgical encounters from December 1, 2021, to 
      October 31, 2022. The predicted ASA-PS score was presented to the anesthesiology 
      provider for review before entering the final ASA-PS score. The study focused on 
      summarizing the available information for the anesthesiologist by using ML 
      methods. The goal was to explore the potential for ML to provide assistance to 
      anesthesiologists by highlighting potential areas of discordance between the 
      variables that generated a given ML prediction and the physician's mental model 
      of the patient's medical comorbidities. RESULTS: For the retrospective analysis, 
      the distribution of predicted ASA-PS scores was 22.7% ASA-PS I, 48.5% II, 23.6% 
      III, 5.1% IV, and 0.04% V. The distribution of clinician-assigned ASA-PS scores 
      was 24.3% for ASA-PS I, 44.5% for ASA-PS II, 24.9% for ASA III, 6.1% for ASA-PS 
      IV, and 0.2% for ASA-V. In the prospective analysis, the final ASA-PS score 
      matched the initial ASA-PS 90.7% of the time and 9.3% were revised after viewing 
      the predicted ASA-PS score. When the initial ASA-PS score and the ML ASA-PS score 
      were discrepant, 19.5% of the cases have a final ASA-PS score which is different 
      from the initial clinician ASA-PS score. The prevalence of multiple chronic 
      conditions increased with ASA-PS score: 34.9% ASA-PS I, 73.2% II, 92.3% III, and 
      94.4% IV. CONCLUSIONS: ML derivation of predicted pediatric ASA-PS scores was 
      successful, with a strong agreement between predicted and clinician-entered 
      ASA-PS scores. Presentation of predicted ASA-PS scores was associated with 
      revision in final scoring for 1-in-10 pediatric patients.

TI  - Use of Wearable Sensor Device and Mobile Application for Objective Assessment of 
      Pain in Post-surgical Patients: A Preliminary Study.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340199 [doi]
AB  - Effective post-operative pain management requires an accurate and frequent 
      assessment of the pain experienced by the patients. The current gold-standard of 
      pain assessment is through patient self-evaluation (e.g., numeric rating scale, 
      NRS) which is subjective, prone to recall-bias, and does not provide 
      comprehensive information of the pain intensity and its trends. We conducted a 
      study to explore the potential of wearable biosensors and machine learning-based 
      analysis of physiological parameters to estimate the pain intensity. The results 
      from our study of post-operative knee surgery patients monitored over a period of 
      30 days demonstrate the feasibility of the system in ambulatory setting, with a 
      substantial agreement (Cohen's Kappa = 0.70, 95% CI 0.68-0.72) between the pain 
      intensity estimation and the patient reported numerical rating scale. Therefore, 
      the wearable biosensors coupled with the machine learning-derived pain estimation 
      are capable of remotely assessing the pain intensity.

TI  - Utilizing Deep Learning to Identify an Ultrasound-guided Nerve Block Target Zone.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340134 [doi]
AB  - Ultrasound guided nerve blocks are increasingly being used in perioperative care 
      as a means of safely delivering analgesia. Unfortunately, identifying nerves in 
      ultrasound images presents a challenging task for novice anesthesiologists. 
      Drawing from online resources, here we attempted to address this issue by 
      developing a deep learning algorithm capable of automatically identifying the 
      transversus abdominis plane region in ultrasound images. Training of our dataset 
      was done using the U-Net architecture and artificial augmentation was done to 
      optimize our training dataset. The Dice score coefficient was used to evaluate 
      our model, with further evaluation against a test set composed of manually drawn 
      labels from a pool of (n=10) expert anesthesiologists.Across all labelers the 
      model achieved a global Dice score of 73.31% over the entire test set. These 
      preliminary results highlight the potential effectiveness of this model as a 
      future ultrasound decision support system in the field of anesthesia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Predicting postoperative pain risk in patients with impacted 
      mandibular third molar extractions is helpful in guiding clinical 
      decision-making, enhancing perioperative pain management, and improving the 
      patients' medical experience. This study aims to develop a prediction model based 
      on machine learning algorithms to identify patients at high risk of postoperative 
      pain after tooth extraction. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study. 
      Outpatients with impacted mandibular third molars were recruited and the outcome 
      was defined as the NRS (Numerical Rating Scale) score of peak postoperative pain 
      within 24 h after the operation ≥7, which is considered a high risk of 
      postoperative pain. We compared the models built using nine different machine 
      learning algorithms and conducted internal and time-series external validations 
      to evaluate the model's predictive performances in terms of the area under the 
      curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-value. RESULTS: A total 
      of 185 patients and 202 cases of impacted mandibular third molar data were 
      included in this study. Five modeling variables were screened out using least 
      absolute selection and shrinkage operator regression, including physician 
      qualification, patient self-reported maximum pain sensitivity, OHI-S-CI, BMI, and 
      systolic blood pressure. The overall performance of the random forest model was 
      evaluated. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the prediction model built 
      using the random forest method were 0.879 (0.861-0.891), 0.857, and 0.846, 
      respectively, for the training set and 0.724 (0.673-0.732), 0.667, and 0.600, 
      respectively, for the time series validation set. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      developed a machine learning-based postoperative pain risk prediction model for 
      impacted mandibular third molar extraction, which is promising for providing a 
      theoretical basis for better pain management to reduce postoperative pain after 
      third molar extraction.

PG  - 77-84

AB  - Big data and artificial intelligence are buzzwords that everyone is talking about 
      and yet always provide a touch of science fiction to the scenery. What is the 
      status of these topics in anesthesia? Are the first robots already rolling 
      through the corridors while doctors are getting bored as all the work has been 
      done? Spoiler alert! We are still far away from achieving this. Initially, paper 
      charts and analogue notes stand in the way of comprehensive digitization. Source 
      systems need to be merged and data standardized, harmonized and validated. 
      Therefore, the friendly android that is rolling towards us, waving and holding 
      a freshly brewed cup of coffee in our thoughts will have to wait; however, 
      a glimpse of the future is already evident in some clinics and the first 
      promising developments are already showing what could be the standard tomorrow. 
      Learning algorithms calculate the length of stay individually for each patient in 
      the intensive care unit (ICU), reducing negative consequences such as readmission 
      and mortality. The field of ultrasound technology for regional anesthesia and 
      closed-loop anesthesia systems is also demonstrating the benefits of artificial 
      intelligence (AI)-assisted technologies in practice. The efforts are diverse and 
      ambitious but they repeatedly collide with privacy challenges and significant 
      capital expenditure, which weigh heavily on an already financially strained 
      healthcare system; however, anyone who listens carefully to the medical staff 
      knows that robots are not what they would expect and the buzzwords big data and 
      artificial intelligence might be less science fiction than initially assumed.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Anesthetic Care: A Survey of Physician 
      Anesthesiologists.
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000006752 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study explored physician anesthesiologists' knowledge, exposure, 
      and perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) and their associations with 
      attitudes and expectations regarding its use in clinical practice. The findings 
      highlight the importance of understanding anesthesiologists' perspectives for the 
      successful integration of AI into anesthesiology, as AI has the potential to 
      revolutionize the field. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 27,056 US physician 
      anesthesiologists was conducted to assess their knowledge, perceptions, and 
      expectations regarding the use of AI in clinical practice. The primary outcome 
      measured was attitude toward the use of AI in clinical practice, with scores of 4 
      or 5 on a 5-point Likert scale indicating positive attitudes. The anticipated 
      impact of AI on various aspects of professional work was measured using a 3-point 
      Likert scale. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between 
      participant responses and attitudes toward the use of AI in clinical practice. 
      RESULTS: A 2021 survey of 27,056 US physician anesthesiologists received 1086 
      responses (4% response rate). Most respondents were male (71%), active clinicians 
      (93%) under 45 (34%). A majority of anesthesiologists (61%) had some knowledge of 
      AI and 48% had a positive attitude toward using AI in clinical practice. While 
      most respondents believed that AI can improve health care efficiency (79%), 
      timeliness (75%), and effectiveness (69%), they are concerned that its 
      integration in anesthesiology could lead to a decreased demand for 
      anesthesiologists (45%) and decreased earnings (45%). Within a decade, 
      respondents expected AI would outperform them in predicting adverse perioperative 
      events (83%), formulating pain management plans (67%), and conducting airway 
      exams (45%). The absence of algorithmic transparency (60%), an ambiguous 
      environment regarding malpractice (47%), and the possibility of medical errors 
      (47%) were cited as significant barriers to the use of AI in clinical practice. 
      Respondents indicated that their motivation to use AI in clinical practice 
      stemmed from its potential to enhance patient outcomes (81%), lower health care 
      expenditures (54%), reduce bias (55%), and boost productivity (53%). Variables 
      associated with positive attitudes toward AI use in clinical practice included 
      male gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; P < .001), 20+ years of experience (OR, 1.8; P 
      < .01), higher AI knowledge (OR, 2.3; P = .01), and greater AI openness (OR, 
      10.6; P < .01). Anxiety about future earnings was associated with negative 
      attitudes toward AI use in clinical practice (OR, 0.54; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Understanding anesthesiologists' perspectives on AI is essential for the 
      effective integration of AI into anesthesiology, as AI has the potential to 
      revolutionize the field.

TI  - Drug target genes and molecular mechanism investigation in isoflurane-induced 
      anesthesia based on WGCNA and machine learning methods.
PG  - 319-333
LID - 10.1080/15376516.2023.2286619 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study sought to identify drug target genes and their associated 
      molecular mechanisms during isoflurane-induced anesthesia in clinical 
      applications. METHODS: Microarray data (ID: GSE64617; isoflurane-treated vs. 
      normal samples) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. 
      Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened and hub genes were 
      investigated using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Protein-protein 
      interactions (PPIs) were constructed among the co-DEGs (common genes between DEGs 
      and hub genes), followed by functional enrichment analyses. Then, three machine 
      learning methods were used to reveal drug targets, followed by validation, 
      nomogram analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis. Finally, an miRNA-target 
      network was constructed. RESULTS: A total of 686 DEGs were identified between the 
      two groups-of which, 183 DEGs integrated with genes revealed by WCGNA were 
      identified as co-genes. These genes, including contactin-associated protein 1 
      (CNTNAP1), are mainly involved in functions such as action potentials. PPI 
      network analysis revealed three models, with the machine learning analysis 
      exploring four drug target genes: A2H, FAM155B, SCARF2, and SDR16C5. ROC and 
      nomogram analyses demonstrated the ideal diagnostic value of these target genes. 
      Finally, miRNA-mRNA pairs were constructed based on the four mRNAs and associated 
      174 miRNAs. CONCLUSION: FA2H, FAM155B, SCARF2, and SDR16C5 may be novel drug 
      target genes for isoflurane-induced anesthesia. CNTNAP1 may participate in the 
      progression of isoflurane-induced anesthesia via its action potential function.

TI  - Design and implementation of a smart Internet of Things chest pain center based 
      on deep learning.
PG  - 18987-19011
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2023840 [doi]
AB  - The data input process for most chest pain centers is not intelligent, requiring 
      a lot of staff to manually input patient information. This leads to problems such 
      as long processing times, high potential for errors, an inability to access 
      patient data in a timely manner and an increasing workload. To address the 
      challenge, an Internet of Things (IoT)-driven chest pain center is designed, 
      which crosses the sensing layer, network layer and application layer. The system 
      enables the construction of intelligent chest pain management through a 
      pre-hospital app, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) positioning, and in-hospital treatment. 
      The pre-hospital app is provided to emergency medical services (EMS) centers, 
      which allows them to record patient information in advance and keep it 
      synchronized with the hospital's database, reducing the time needed for 
      treatment. UWB positioning obtains the patient's hospital information through the 
      zero-dimensional base station and the corresponding calculation engine, and 
      in-hospital treatment involves automatic acquisition of patient information 
      through web and mobile applications. The system also introduces the Bidirectional 
      Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Conditional Random Field (CRF)-based algorithm to 
      train electronic medical record information for chest pain patients, extracting 
      the patient's chest pain clinical symptoms. The resulting data are saved in the 
      chest pain patient database and uploaded to the national chest pain center. The 
      system has been used in Liaoning Provincial People's Hospital, and its subsequent 
      assistance to doctors and nurses in collaborative treatment, data feedback and 
      analysis is of great significance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is a common complication occurring 
      in surgical practice. This study aims to comprehensively review the collaboration 
      and impact of countries, institutions, authors, journals, keywords, and critical 
      papers on intraoperative hypotension from the perspective of bibliometric, and to 
      evaluate the evolution of knowledge structure clustering and identify research 
      hotspots and emerging topics. METHODS: Articles and reviews related to IOH 
      published from 2004 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core 
      Collection. Bibliometric analyses and visualization were conducted on Excel, 
      CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix (R-Tool of R-Studio). RESULTS: A total of 
      1,784 articles and reviews were included from 2004 to 2022. The number of 
      articles on IOH gradually increased in the past few years, and peaked in 2021. 
      These publications were chiefly from 1,938 institutions in 40 countries, led by 
      America and China in publications. Sessler Daniel I published the most papers and 
      enjoyed the highest number of citations. Analysis of the journals with the most 
      outputs showed that most journals concentrated on perioperative medicine and 
      clinical anesthesiology. Delirium, acute kidney injury and vasoconstrictor agents 
      are the current and developing research hotspots. The keywords "Acute kidney 
      injury", "postoperative complication", "machine learning", "risk factors" and 
      "hemodynamic instability" may also become new trends and focuses of the near 
      future research. CONCLUSION: This study uses bibliometrics and visualization 
      methods to comprehensively review the research on intraoperative hypotension, 
      which is helpful for scholars to better understand the dynamic evolution of IOH 
      and provide directions for future research.

TI  - Finding the best trade-off between performance and interpretability in predicting 
      hospital length of stay using structured and unstructured data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop high-performing Machine Learning and Deep 
      Learning models in predicting hospital length of stay (LOS) while enhancing 
      interpretability. We compare performance and interpretability of models trained 
      only on structured tabular data with models trained only on unstructured clinical 
      text data, and on mixed data. METHODS: The structured data was used to train 
      fourteen classical Machine Learning models including advanced ensemble trees, 
      neural networks and k-nearest neighbors. The unstructured data was used to 
      fine-tune a pre-trained Bio Clinical BERT Transformer Deep Learning model. The 
      structured and unstructured data were then merged into a tabular dataset after 
      vectorization of the clinical text and a dimensional reduction through Latent 
      Dirichlet Allocation. The study used the free and publicly available Medical 
      Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database, on the open AutoML 
      Library AutoGluon. Performance is evaluated with respect to two types of random 
      classifiers, used as baselines. RESULTS: The best model from structured data 
      demonstrates high performance (ROC AUC = 0.944, PRC AUC = 0.655) with limited 
      interpretability, where the most important predictors of prolonged LOS are the 
      level of blood urea nitrogen and of platelets. The Transformer model displays a 
      good but lower performance (ROC AUC = 0.842, PRC AUC = 0.375) with a richer array 
      of interpretability by providing more specific in-hospital factors including 
      procedures, conditions, and medical history. The best model trained on mixed data 
      satisfies both a high level of performance (ROC AUC = 0.963, PRC AUC = 0.746) and 
      a much larger scope in interpretability including pathologies of the intestine, 
      the colon, and the blood; infectious diseases, respiratory problems, procedures 
      involving sedation and intubation, and vascular surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      outperform most of the state-of-the-art models in LOS prediction both in terms of 
      performance and of interpretability. Data fusion between structured and 
      unstructured text data may significantly improve performance and 
      interpretability.

TI  - Machine-learning vs. logistic regression for preoperative prediction of medical 
      morbidity after fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty-a comparative study.
PG  - 391
LID - 10.1186/s12871-023-02354-z [doi]
LID - 391
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machine-learning models may improve prediction of length of stay 
      (LOS) and morbidity after surgery. However, few studies include fast-track 
      programs, and most rely on administrative coding with limited follow-up and 
      information on perioperative care. This study investigates potential benefits of 
      a machine-learning model for prediction of postoperative morbidity in fast-track 
      total hip (THA) and knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: Cohort study in consecutive 
      unselected primary THA/TKA between 2014-2017 from seven Danish centers with 
      established fast-track protocols. Preoperative comorbidity and prescribed 
      medication were recorded prospectively and information on length of stay and 
      readmissions was obtained through the Danish National Patient Registry and 
      medical records. We used a machine-learning model (Boosted Decision Trees) based 
      on boosted decision trees with 33 preoperative variables for predicting "medical" 
      morbidity leading to LOS > 4 days or 90-days readmissions and compared to a 
      logistical regression model based on the same variables. We also evaluated two 
      parsimonious models, using the ten most important variables in the full 
      machine-learning and logistic regression models. Data collected between 2014-2016 
      (n:18,013) was used for model training and data from 2017 (n:3913) was used for 
      testing. Model performances were analyzed using precision, area under receiver 
      operating (AUROC) and precision recall curves (AUPRC), as well as the Mathews 
      Correlation Coefficient. Variable importance was analyzed using Shapley Additive 
      Explanations values. RESULTS: Using a threshold of 20% "risk-patients" (n:782), 
      precision, AUROC and AUPRC were 13.6%, 76.3% and 15.5% vs. 12.4%, 74.7% and 15.6% 
      for the machine-learning and logistic regression model, respectively. The 
      parsimonious machine-learning model performed better than the full logistic 
      regression model. Of the top ten variables, eight were shared between the 
      machine-learning and logistic regression models, but with a considerable 
      age-related variation in importance of specific types of medication. CONCLUSION: 
      A machine-learning model using preoperative characteristics and prescriptions 
      slightly improved identification of patients in high-risk of "medical" 
      complications after fast-track THA and TKA compared to a logistic regression 
      model. Such algorithms could help find a manageable population of patients who 
      may benefit most from intensified perioperative care.

      Physical Status Classification.
PG  - e47155
LID - 10.7759/cureus.47155 [doi]
LID - e47155
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status (PS) 
      Classification System defines perioperative patient scores ranging from 1 to 6 
      (healthy to brain dead, respectively). The scoring is performed and used by 
      physician anesthesiologists and providers to classify surgical patients based on 
      co-morbidities and various clinical characteristics. There is potentially a 
      variability in scoring stemming from individual biases. The biases impact the 
      prediction of operating times, length of stay in the hospital, anesthetic 
      management, and billing. This study's purpose was to develop an automated system 
      to achieve reproducible scoring. METHODS: A machine learning (ML) model was 
      trained on already assigned ASA PS scores of 12,064 patients. The ML algorithm 
      was automatically selected by Wolfram Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Champaign, 
      IL) and tested with retrospective records not used in training. Manual scoring 
      was performed by the anesthesiologist as part of the standard preoperative 
      evaluation. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in R (version 4.2.2; R 
      Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) was calculated to assess the consistency 
      of scoring. RESULTS: An ML model was trained on the data corresponding to 12,064 
      patients. Logistic regression was chosen automatically, with an accuracy of 
      70.3±1.0% against the training dataset. The accuracy against 1,999 patients (the 
      test dataset) was 69.6±1.0%. The ICC for the comparison between ML and the 
      anesthesiologists' ASA PS scores was greater than 0.4 ("fair to good"). 
      CONCLUSIONS: We have shown the feasibility of applying ML to assess the ASA PS 
      score within an oncology patient population. Though our accuracy was not very 
      good, we feel that, as more data are mined, a valid foundation for refinement to 
      ML will emerge.

      (CI) has been substantially developed. We aimed to assess the trends in the 
      published literature to characterize CI. Materials and Methods: We queried PubMed 
      for all CI-related entries published during 1970-2022. The following data were 
      extracted: year of publication, publishing journal, title, keywords, and abstract 
      text. Search terms belonged to the patient's age group, etiology for hearing 
      loss, indications for CI, and surgical methodological advancement. Annual trends 
      of publications were plotted. The slopes of publication trends were calculated by 
      fitting regression lines to the yearly number of publications. Results: Overall, 
      19,428 CIs articles were identified. Pediatric-related CI was the most dominant 
      sub-population among the age groups, with the highest rate and slope during the 
      years (slope 5.2 ± 0.3, p < 0.001), while elderly-related CIs had significantly 
      fewer publications. Entries concerning hearing preservation showed the sharpest 
      rise among the methods, from no entries in 1980 to 46 entries in 2021 (slope 1.7 
      ± 0.2, p < 0.001). Entries concerning robotic surgery emerged in 2000, with a 
      sharp increase in recent years (slope 0.5 ± 0.1, p < 0.001). Drug-eluting 
      electrodes and CI under local-anesthesia have been reported only in the past five 
      years, with a gradual rise. Conclusions: Publications regarding CI among 
      pediatrics outnumbered all other indications, supporting the rising, pivotal role 
      of CI in the rehabilitation of children with sensorineural hearing loss. 
      Hearing-preservation publications have recently rapidly risen, identified as the 
      primary trend of the current era, followed by a sharp rise of robotic surgery 
      that is evolving and could define the next revolution.

TI  - Machine Learning Technology for EEG-Forecast of the Blood-Brain Barrier Leakage 
      and the Activation of the Brain's Drainage System during Isoflurane Anesthesia.
LID - 10.3390/biom13111605 [doi]
LID - 1605
AB  - Anesthesia enables the painless performance of complex surgical procedures. 
      However, the effects of anesthesia on the brain may not be limited only by its 
      duration. Also, anesthetic agents may cause long-lasting changes in the brain. 
      There is growing evidence that anesthesia can disrupt the integrity of the 
      blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. 
      However, there are no widely used methods for real-time BBB monitoring during 
      surgery. The development of technologies for an express diagnosis of the opening 
      of the BBB (OBBB) is a challenge for reducing post-surgical/anesthesia 
      consequences. In this study on male rats, we demonstrate a successful application 
      of machine learning technology, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), to 
      recognize the OBBB induced by isoflurane, which is widely used in surgery. The 
      ANNs were trained on our previously presented data obtained on the sound-induced 
      OBBB with an 85% testing accuracy. Using an optical and nonlinear analysis of the 
      OBBB, we found that 1% isoflurane does not induce any changes in the BBB, while 
      4% isoflurane caused significant BBB leakage in all tested rats. Both 1% and 4% 
      isoflurane stimulate the brain's drainage system (BDS) in a dose-related manner. 
      We show that ANNs can recognize the OBBB induced by 4% isoflurane in 57% of rats 
      and BDS activation induced by 1% isoflurane in 81% of rats. These results open 
      new perspectives for the development of clinically significant bedside 
      technologies for EEG-monitoring of OBBB and BDS.

      Oximeters and Their Prospects in the Field of Digital Medicine.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11223003 [doi]
LID - 3003
AB  - This study conducted a comprehensive patent and bibliometric analysis to 
      elucidate the evolving scientific landscape surrounding the development and 
      application of pulse oximeters, including in the field of digital medicine. 
      Utilizing data from the Lens database for the period of 2000-2023, we identified 
      the United States, China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia, 
      Taiwan, and the United Kingdom as the predominant countries in patent issuance 
      for pulse oximeter technology. Our bibliometric analysis revealed a consistent 
      temporal trend in both the volume of publications and citations, underscoring the 
      growing importance of pulse oximeters in digitally-enabled medical practice. 
      Using the VOSviewer software(version 1.6.18), we discerned six primary research 
      clusters: (1) measurement accuracy; (2) integration with the Internet of Things; 
      (3) applicability across diverse pathologies; (4) telemedicine and mobile 
      applications; (5) artificial intelligence and deep learning; and (6) utilization 
      in anesthesiology, resuscitation, and intensive care departments. The findings of 
      this study indicate the prospects for leveraging digital technologies in the use 
      of pulse oximetry in various fields of medicine, with implications for advancing 
      the understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cardio-respiratory 
      pathologies. The conducted patent and bibliometric analysis allowed the 
      identification of technical solutions to reduce the risks associated with pulse 
      oximetry: improving precision and validity, technically improved clinical 
      diagnostic use, and the use of machine learning.

LID - e52022
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) has shown promising levels of effectiveness in 
      nursing education, pain management, and rehabilitation. However, meta-analyses 
      have discussed the effects of VR usage in nursing unilaterally and 
      inconsistently, and the evidence base is diffuse and varied. OBJECTIVE: We aimed 
      to synthesize the combined evidence from meta-analyses that assessed the effects 
      of nurses using VR technology on nursing education or patient health outcomes. 
      METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review by searching for meta-analyses about VR 
      intervention in clinical nursing practice on Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, 
      and PubMed, and in reference lists. Eligible studies were published in English 
      between December 1, 2012, and September 20, 2023. Meta-analyses of ≤2 
      intervention studies and meta-analyses without 95% CI or heterogeneity data were 
      excluded. Characteristic indicators, population information, VR intervention 
      information, and 95% CIs were extracted. A descriptive analysis of research 
      results was conducted to discern relationships between VR interventions and 
      outcomes. I2 and P values were used to evaluate publication bias. AMSTAR (A 
      Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) 2 and the GRADE (Grading of 
      Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) checklist were used to 
      appraise literature quality. RESULTS: In total, 768 records were identified; 74 
      meta-analyses were included for review. The most reported VR study conditions 
      were neuronursing (25/74, 34%), pediatric nursing (13/74, 18%), surgical and 
      wound care (11/74, 15%), oncological nursing (11/74, 15%), and older adult 
      nursing (10/74, 14%). Further, 30% (22/74) of meta-analyses reported publication 
      bias, and 15% (11/74) and 8% (6/74) were rated as "high" based on AMSTAR 2 and 
      the GRADE checklist, respectively. The main outcome indicators among all included 
      meta-analyses were pain (37/214, 17.3%), anxiety (36/214, 16.8%), cognitive 
      function (17/214, 7.9%), balance (16/214, 7.5%), depression (16/214, 7.5%), motor 
      function (12/214, 5.6%), and participation in life (12/214, 5.6%). VR treatment 
      for cognition, pain, anxiety, and depression was effective (all P values were 
      <.05), while the utility of VR for improving motor function, balance, memory, and 
      attention was controversial. Adverse effects included nausea, vomiting, and 
      dizziness (incidence: range 4.76%-50%). The most common VR platforms were Pico VR 
      glasses, head-mounted displays, the Nintendo Wii, and the Xbox Kinect. VR 
      intervention duration ranged from 2 weeks to 12 months (typically ≥4 wk). VR 
      session length and frequency ranged from 5 to 100 minutes and from 1 to 10 times 
      per week, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: VR in nursing has positive effects-relieving 
      patients' pain, anxiety, and depression and improving cognitive function-despite 
      the included studies' limited quality. However, applying VR in nursing to improve 
      patients' motor function, balance, memory, and attention remains controversial. 
      Nursing researchers need to further explore the effects and standard operation 
      protocols of VR in clinical practice, and more high-quality research on VR in 
      nursing is needed.

TI  - Feasibility interventional study investigating PAIN in neurorehabilitation 
      through wearabLE SensorS (PAINLESS): a study protocol.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Millions of people survive injuries to the central or peripheral 
      nervous system for which neurorehabilitation is required. In addition to the 
      physical and cognitive impairments, many neurorehabilitation patients experience 
      pain, often not widely recognised and inadequately treated. This is particularly 
      true for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, for whom pain is one of the most 
      common symptoms. In clinical practice, pain assessment is usually conducted based 
      on a subjective estimate. This approach can lead to inaccurate evaluations due to 
      the influence of numerous factors, including emotional or cognitive aspects. To 
      date, no objective and simple to use clinical methods allow objective 
      quantification of pain and the diagnostic differentiation between the two main 
      types of pain (nociceptive vs neuropathic). Wearable technologies and artificial 
      intelligence (AI) have the potential to bridge this gap by continuously 
      monitoring patients' health parameters and extracting meaningful information from 
      them. Therefore, we propose to develop a new automatic AI-powered tool to assess 
      pain and its characteristics during neurorehabilitation treatments using 
      physiological signals collected by wearable sensors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aim 
      to recruit 15 participants suffering from MS undergoing physiotherapy treatment. 
      During the study, participants will wear a wristband for three consecutive days 
      and be monitored before and after their physiotherapy sessions. Measurement of 
      traditionally used pain assessment questionnaires and scales (ie, painDETECT, 
      Doleur Neuropathique 4 Questions, EuroQoL-5-dimension-3-level) and physiological 
      signals (photoplethysmography, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, 
      accelerometer data) will be collected. Relevant parameters from physiological 
      signals will be identified, and AI algorithms will be used to develop automatic 
      classification methods. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by 
      the local Ethical Committee (285-2022-SPER-AUSLBO). Participants are required to 
      provide written informed consent. The results will be disseminated through 
      contributions to international conferences and scientific journals, and they will 
      also be included in a doctoral dissertation. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Association between postinduction hypotension and postoperative mortality: a 
      single-centre retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 343-352
LID - 10.1007/s12630-023-02653-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to elucidate whether postinduction hypotension (PIH), defined 
      as hypotension between anesthesia induction and skin incision, and intraoperative 
      hypotension (IOH) are associated with postoperative mortality. METHODS: We 
      conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with an ASA Physical 
      Status I-IV who underwent noncardiac and nonobstetric surgery under general 
      anesthesia between 2015 and 2021 at Nagoya City University Hospital. The primary 
      and secondary outcomes were 30-day and 90-day postoperative mortality, 
      respectively. We calculated four hypotensive indices (with time proportion of the 
      area under the threshold being the primary exposure variable) to evaluate the 
      association between hypotension (defined as a mean blood pressure < 65 mm Hg) and 
      mortality using multivariable logistic regression models. We used propensity 
      score matching and RUSBoost (random under-sampling and boosting), a 
      machine-learning model for imbalanced data, for sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: 
      Postinduction hypotension and IOH were observed in 82% and 84% of patients, 
      respectively. The 30-day and 90-day postoperative mortality rates were 0.4% 
      (52/14,210) and 1.0% (138/13,334), respectively. Postinduction hypotension was 
      not associated with 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.03; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.93 to 1.13; P = 0.60) and 90-day mortality (aOR, 
      1.01; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.07; P = 0.82). Conversely, IOH was associated with 30-day 
      mortality (aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.27; P < 0.001) and 90-day mortality (aOR, 
      1.12; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.19; P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses supported the 
      association of IOH but not PIH with postoperative mortality. CONCLUSION: Despite 
      limitations, including power and residual confounding, postoperative mortality 
      was associated with IOH but not with PIH.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Postoperative delirium is associated with morbidity and 
      mortality, and its incidence varies widely. Using known predisposing and 
      precipitating factors, we sought to develop postoperative delirium prediction 
      models for noncardiac surgical patients. DESIGN: Retrospective prediction model 
      study. SETTING: Major quaternary medical center. PATIENTS: Our January 2016 to 
      June 2020 training dataset included 51,677 patients of whom 2795 patients had 
      delirium. Our July 2020 to January 2022 validation dataset included 14,438 
      patients of whom 912 patients had delirium. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: We 
      trained and validated two static prediction models and one dynamic delirium 
      prediction model. For the static models, we used random survival forests and 
      traditional Cox proportional hazard models to predict postoperative delirium from 
      preoperative variables, or from a combination of preoperative and intraoperative 
      variables. We also used landmark modeling to dynamically predict postoperative 
      delirium using preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables before 
      onset of delirium. MAIN RESULTS: In the validation analyses, the static random 
      forest model had a c-statistic of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.82) and a Brier score of 
      0.04 with preoperative variables only, and a c-statistic of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.84, 
      0.87) and a Brier score of 0.04 when preoperative and intraoperative variables 
      were combined. The corresponding Cox models had similar discrimination metrics 
      with slightly better calibration. The dynamic model - using all available data, 
      i.e., preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data - had an overall 
      c-index of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Using preoperative and 
      intraoperative variables, simple static models performed as well as a dynamic 
      delirium prediction model that also included postoperative variables. Baseline 
      predisposing factors thus appear to contribute far more to delirium after 
      noncardiac surgery than intraoperative or postoperative variables. Improved 
      postoperative data capture may help improve delirium prediction and should be 
      evaluated in future studies.

AB  - Preoperative knowledge of expected postoperative pain can help guide 
      perioperative pain management and focus interventions on patients with the 
      greatest risk of acute pain. However, current methods for predicting 
      postoperative pain require patient and clinician input or laborious manual chart 
      review and often do not achieve sufficient performance. We use routinely 
      collected electronic health record data from a multicenter dataset of 234,274 
      adult non-cardiac surgical patients to develop a machine learning method which 
      predicts maximum pain scores on the day of surgery and four subsequent days and 
      validate this method in a prospective cohort. Our method, POPS, is fully 
      automated and relies only on data available prior to surgery, allowing 
      application in all patients scheduled for or considering surgery. Here we report 
      that POPS achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms clinician 
      predictions on all postoperative days when predicting maximum pain on the 0-10 
      NRS in prospective validation, though with degraded calibration. POPS is 
      interpretable, identifying comorbidities that significantly contribute to 
      postoperative pain based on patient-specific context, which can assist clinicians 
      in mitigating cases of acute pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Simple and rapid tools for screening high-risk patients for 
      perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) are urgently needed to improve 
      patient outcomes. We developed an online tool with machine-learning algorithms 
      using routine variables based on multicenter data. METHODS: The entire dataset 
      was composed of 49,768 surgical patients from 3 representative academic hospitals 
      in China. Surgical patients older than 45 years, those undergoing general 
      anesthesia, and those without a history of PND were enrolled. When the patient's 
      discharge diagnosis was PND, the patient was in the PND group. Patients in the 
      non-PND group were randomly extracted from the big data platform according to the 
      surgical type, age, and source of data in the PND group with a ratio of 3:1. 
      After data preprocessing and feature selection, general linear model (GLM), 
      artificial neural network (ANN), and naive Bayes (NB) were used for model 
      development and evaluation. Model performance was evaluated by the area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (ROCAUC), the area under the 
      precision-recall curve (PRAUC), the Brier score, the index of prediction accuracy 
      (IPA), sensitivity, specificity, etc. The model was also externally validated on 
      the multiparameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care (MIMIC) Ⅳ database. 
      Afterward, we developed an online visualization tool to preoperatively predict 
      patients' risk of developing PND based on the models with the best performance. 
      RESULTS: A total of 1051 patients (242 PND and 809 non-PND) and 2884 patients 
      (6.2% patients with PND) were analyzed on multicenter data (model development, 
      test [internal validation], external validation-1) and MIMIC Ⅳ dataset (external 
      validation-2). The model performance based on GLM was much better than that based 
      on ANN and NB. The best-performing GLM model on validation-1 dataset achieved 
      ROCAUC (0.874; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.833-0.915), PRAUC (0.685; 95% CI, 
      0.584-0.786), sensitivity (72.6%; 95% CI, 61.4%-81.5%), specificity (84.4%; 95% 
      CI, 79.3%-88.4%), Brier score (0.131), and IPA (44.7%), and of which the ROCAUC 
      (0.761, 95% CI, 0.712-0.809), the PRAUC (0.475, 95% CI, 0.370-0.581), Brier score 
      (0.053), and IPA (76.8%) on validation-2 dataset. Afterward, we developed an 
      online tool (https://pnd-predictive-model-dynnom.shinyapps.io/ DynNomapp/) with 
      10 routine variables for preoperatively screening high-risk patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simple and rapid online tool to preoperatively screen 
      patients' risk of PND using GLM based on multicenter data, which may help medical 
      staff's decision-making regarding perioperative management strategies to improve 
      patient outcomes.

TI  - A Deep Learning Framework for Anesthesia Depth Prediction from Drug Infusion 
      History.
LID - 10.3390/s23218994 [doi]
LID - 8994
AB  - In the target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol and remifentanil intravenous 
      anesthesia, accurate prediction of the depth of anesthesia (DOA) is very 
      challenging. Patients with different physiological characteristics have 
      inconsistent pharmacodynamic responses during different stages of anesthesia. For 
      example, in TCI, older adults transition smoothly from the induction period to 
      the maintenance period, while younger adults are more prone to anesthetic 
      awareness, resulting in different DOA data distributions among patients. To 
      address these problems, a deep learning framework that incorporates domain 
      adaptation and knowledge distillation and uses propofol and remifentanil doses at 
      historical moments to continuously predict the bispectral index (BIS) is proposed 
      in this paper. Specifically, a modified adaptive recurrent neural network 
      (AdaRNN) is adopted to address data distribution differences among patients. 
      Moreover, a knowledge distillation pipeline is developed to train the prediction 
      network by enabling it to learn intermediate feature representations of the 
      teacher network. The experimental results show that our method exhibits better 
      performance than existing approaches during all anesthetic phases in the TCI of 
      propofol and remifentanil intravenous anesthesia. In particular, our method 
      outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of root mean square error and 
      mean absolute error by 1 and 0.8, respectively, in the internal dataset as well 
      as in the publicly available dataset.

TI  - Artificial intelligence technology and ultrasound-guided nerve block for 
      analgesia in total knee arthroplasty.
PG  - 7026-7033
LID - 10.12998/wjcc.v11.i29.7026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knee diseases are more common in middle-aged and elderly people, so 
      artificial knee replacement is also more used in middle-aged and elderly people. 
      Although the patient's pain can be reduced through surgery, often accompanied by 
      moderate pain after surgery and neutralization, which not only increases the 
      psychological burden of the patient, but also greatly reduces the postoperative 
      recovery effect, and may also lead to the occurrence of postoperative adverse 
      events in severe cases. AIM: To investigate the analgesic effect of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and ultrasound-guided nerve block in total knee arthroplasty 
      (TKA). METHODS: A total of 92 patients with TKA admitted to our hospital from 
      January 2021 to January 2022 were opted and divided into two groups according to 
      the treatment regimen. The control group received combined spinal-epidural 
      anesthesia. The research group received AI technique combined with 
      ultrasound-guided nerve block anesthesia. The sensory block time, motor block 
      time, visual analogue scale (VAS) at different time points and complications were 
      contrasted between the two groups. RESULTS: The time of sensory block onset and 
      sensory block perfection in the research group was shorter than those in the 
      control group, but the results had no significant difference (P > 0.05). Duration 
      of sensory block in the research group was significantly longer than those in the 
      control group (P < 0.05). The time of motor block onset and motor block 
      perfection in the research group was shorter than those in the control group, but 
      the results had no significant difference (P > 0.05). Duration of motor block in 
      the research group was significantly longer than those in the control group. The 
      VAS scales of the research group were significantly lower than that of the 
      control group at different time points (P < 0.05). The postoperative hip flexion 
      and abduction range of motion in the research group were significantly better 
      than those in the control group at different time points (P < 0.05). The 
      incidence of complications was significantly lower in the research group than in 
      the control group (P = 0.049). CONCLUSION: In TKA, the combination of AI 
      technology and ultrasound-guided nerve block has a significantly effect, with 
      fewer postoperative complications and significantly analgesic effect, which is 
      worthy of application.

AB  - Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) often causes airway complications, particularly 
      posing an elevated risk of aspiration and airway obstruction in obese patients. 
      This study aimed to quantify the levels of aspiration and airway obstruction 
      using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based acoustic analysis algorithm, 
      assessing its utility in identifying airway complications in obese patients. To 
      verify the correlation between the stridor quantitative value (STQV) calculated 
      by acoustic analysis and body weight, and to further evaluate fluid retention and 
      airway obstruction, STQV calculated exhaled breath sounds collected at the neck 
      region, was compared before and after injection of 3 ml of water in the oral 
      cavity and at the start and end of the MAC procedures. STQV measured immediately 
      following the initiation of MAC exhibited a weak correlation with body mass 
      index. Furhtermore, STQV values before and after water injection increased 
      predominantly after injection, further increased at the end of MAC. AI-based 
      analysis of cervical respiratory sounds can enhance the safety of airway 
      management during MAC by quantifying airway obstruction and fluid retention in 
      obese patients. J. Med. Invest. 70 : 430-435, August, 2023.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain is one of the most common complications after 
      surgery. In order to detect early and intervene in time for moderate to severe 
      postoperative pain, it is necessary to identify risk factors and construct 
      clinical prediction models. This study aimed to identify significant risk factors 
      and establish a better-performing model to predict moderate to severe acute 
      postoperative pain after orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia. METHODS: 
      Patients who underwent orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia were divided 
      into patients with moderate to severe pain group (group P) and patients without 
      moderate to severe pain group (group N) based on VAS scores. The features 
      selected by Lasso regression were processed by the random forest and multivariate 
      logistic regression models to predict pain outcomes. The classification 
      performance of the two models was evaluated through the testing set. The area 
      under the curves (AUC), the accuracy of the classifiers, and the classification 
      error rate for both classifiers were calculated, the better-performing model was 
      used to predict moderate to severe acute postoperative pain after orthopedic 
      surgery under general anesthesia. RESULTS: A total of 327 patients were enrolled 
      in this study (228 in the training set and 99 in the testing set). The incidence 
      of moderate to severe postoperative pain was 41.3%. The random forest model 
      revealed a classification error rate of 25.2% and an AUC of 0.810 in the testing 
      set. The multivariate logistic regression model revealed a classification error 
      rate of 31.3% and an AUC of 0.764 in the testing set. The random forest model was 
      chosen for predicting clinical outcomes in this study. The risk factors with the 
      greatest and second contribution were immobilization and duration of surgery, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The random forest model can be used to predict 
      moderate to severe acute postoperative pain after orthopedic surgery under 
      general anesthesia, which is of potential clinical application value.

TI  - Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury after Extracorporeal Cardiac Surgery (CSA-AKI) 
      by Machine Learning Algorithms.
PG  - E537-E551
LID - 10.59958/hsf.5673 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute renal failure after extracorporeal cardiac surgery under 
      general anesthesia is high and unpredictable, but machine learning algorithms 
      could change this. A feasible approach is to use machine learning models to 
      construct models to predict acute kidney injury after extracorporeal cardiac 
      surgery (CSA-AKI) and screen for the best predictive model. METHOD: From January 
      2014 to December 2021, 2187 patients undergoing extracorporeal cardiac surgery at 
      the third hospital of Hebei Medical University and the first medical centre of 
      Chinese PLA General Hospital were collected in this study. After excluding 923 
      patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria, a dataset of 1264 patients with 
      125 clinical indexes was constructed. After screening the feature variables using 
      Least absolute shrinkage (LASSO) regression, the dataset was randomly divided 
      into a training set (70%), test set (30%), and six machine learning algorithms, 
      including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic regression (LRC), light 
      gradient boosting machine (LGBM), random forest classifier (RFC), adaptive 
      boosting (AdaBoost), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), were used in training set for 
      predicting the CSA-AKI. The machine learning model with the best predictive 
      performance was selected to complete external validation of the test set. The 
      SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was used to interpret the model. 
      RESULTS: Of all 1264 patients, 372 (29.43%) patients presented with CSA-AKI. The 
      LASSO regression eliminated 22 feature variables out of 125 before model 
      development. Among the six prediction models, the RFC prediction model has the 
      best prediction performance, with an Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.778 (95% 
      CI: 0.726-0.830) in the test set and the best net benefit compared to the other 
      tools. SHAP explained the impact of different feature variables on the predicted 
      outcome, where the three most influential feature variables were creatinine 
      clearance (CRC), intraoperative urine output (mL/kg/h) and age. CONCLUSION: We 
      developed an RFC prediction model to predict the CSA-AKI, which has good 
      predictive performance and can explain the factors affecting the prediction 
      results of cases by integrating the SHAP method.

TI  - Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Prediction: Machine Learning Insights from a 
      Comprehensive Analysis of Perioperative Data.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering10101152 [doi]
LID - 1152
AB  - Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common complications after surgery. 
      This study aimed to present the utilization of machine learning for predicting 
      PONV and provide insights based on a large amount of data. This retrospective 
      study included data on perioperative features of patients, such as patient 
      characteristics and perioperative factors, from two hospitals. Logistic 
      regression algorithms, random forest, light-gradient boosting machines, and 
      multilayer perceptrons were used as machine learning algorithms to develop the 
      models. The dataset of this study included 106,860 adult patients, with an 
      overall incidence rate of 14.4% for PONV. The area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC) of the models was 0.60-0.67. In the prediction 
      models that included only the known risk and mitigating factors of PONV, the 
      AUROC of the models was 0.54-0.69. Some features were found to be associated with 
      patient-controlled analgesia, with opioids being the most important feature in 
      almost all models. In conclusion, machine learning provides valuable insights 
      into PONV prediction, the selection of significant features for prediction, and 
      feature engineering.

TI  - Temporal Generalizability of Machine Learning Models for Predicting Postoperative 
      Delirium Using Electronic Health Record Data: Model Development and Validation 
      Study.

LID - e50895
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although machine learning models demonstrate significant potential in 
      predicting postoperative delirium, the advantages of their implementation in 
      real-world settings remain unclear and require a comparison with conventional 
      models in practical applications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to 
      validate the temporal generalizability of decision tree ensemble and sparse 
      linear regression models for predicting delirium after surgery compared with that 
      of the traditional logistic regression model. METHODS: The health record data of 
      patients hospitalized at an advanced emergency and critical care medical center 
      in Kumamoto, Japan, were collected electronically. We developed a decision tree 
      ensemble model using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and a sparse linear 
      regression model using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
      regression. To evaluate the predictive performance of the model, we used the area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the Matthews 
      correlation coefficient (MCC) to measure discrimination and the slope and 
      intercept of the regression between predicted and observed probabilities to 
      measure calibration. The Brier score was evaluated as an overall performance 
      metric. We included 11,863 consecutive patients who underwent surgery with 
      general anesthesia between December 2017 and February 2022. The patients were 
      divided into a derivation cohort before the COVID-19 pandemic and a validation 
      cohort during the COVID-19 pandemic. Postoperative delirium was diagnosed 
      according to the confusion assessment method. RESULTS: A total of 6497 patients 
      (68.5, SD 14.4 years, women n=2627, 40.4%) were included in the derivation 
      cohort, and 5366 patients (67.8, SD 14.6 years, women n=2105, 39.2%) were 
      included in the validation cohort. Regarding discrimination, the XGBoost model 
      (AUROC 0.87-0.90 and MCC 0.34-0.44) did not significantly outperform the LASSO 
      model (AUROC 0.86-0.89 and MCC 0.34-0.41). The logistic regression model (AUROC 
      0.84-0.88, MCC 0.33-0.40, slope 1.01-1.19, intercept -0.16 to 0.06, and Brier 
      score 0.06-0.07), with 8 predictors (age, intensive care unit, neurosurgery, 
      emergency admission, anesthesia time, BMI, blood loss during surgery, and use of 
      an ambulance) achieved good predictive performance. CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost 
      model did not significantly outperform the LASSO model in predicting 
      postoperative delirium. Furthermore, a parsimonious logistic model with a few 
      important predictors achieved comparable performance to machine learning models 
      in predicting postoperative delirium.

TI  - Deep Learning Model for Automated Trainee Assessment During High-Fidelity 
      Simulation.
PG  - 1274-1277
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000005290 [doi]
AB  - PROBLEM: Implementation of competency-based medical education has necessitated 
      more frequent trainee assessments. Use of simulation as an assessment tool is 
      limited by access to trained examiners, cost, and concerns with interrater 
      reliability. Developing an automated tool for pass/fail assessment of trainees in 
      simulation could improve accessibility and quality assurance of assessments. This 
      study aimed to develop an automated assessment model using deep learning 
      techniques to assess performance of anesthesiology trainees in a simulated 
      critical event. APPROACH: The authors retrospectively analyzed anaphylaxis 
      simulation videos to train and validate a deep learning model. They used an 
      anaphylactic shock simulation video database from an established simulation 
      curriculum, integrating a convenience sample of 52 usable videos. The core part 
      of the model, developed between July 2019 and July 2020, is a bidirectional 
      transformer encoder. OUTCOMES: The main outcome was the F1 score, accuracy, 
      recall, and precision of the automated assessment model in analyzing pass/fail of 
      trainees in simulation videos. Five models were developed and evaluated. The 
      strongest model was model 1 with an accuracy of 71% and an F1 score of 0.68. NEXT 
      STEPS: The authors demonstrated the feasibility of developing a deep learning 
      model from a simulation database that can be used for automated assessment of 
      medical trainees in a simulated anaphylaxis scenario. The important next steps 
      are to (1) integrate a larger simulation dataset to improve the accuracy of the 
      model; (2) assess the accuracy of the model on alternative anaphylaxis 
      simulations, additional medical disciplines, and alternative medical education 
      evaluation modalities; and (3) gather feedback from education leadership and 
      clinician educators surrounding the perceived strengths and weaknesses of deep 
      learning models for simulation assessment. Overall, this novel approach for 
      performance prediction has broad implications in medical education and 
      assessment.

TI  - Leveraging artificial intelligence to identify high-risk patients for 
      postoperative sore throat: An observational study.
LID - 10.17305/bb.2023.9519 [doi]
AB  - Postoperative sore throat (POST) is a prevalent complication after general 
      anesthesia and targeting high-risk patients help in its prevention. This study 
      developed and validated a machine learning model to predict POST. A total number 
      of 834 patients who underwent general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation 
      were included in this study. Data from a cohort of 685 patients was used for 
      model development and validation, whilst a cohort of 149 patients served for 
      external validation. The prediction performance of random forest (RF), neural 
      network (NN), and XGBoost models was compared using comprehensive performance 
      metrics. The Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) methods 
      elucidated the best-performing model. POST incidences across training, 
      validation, and testing cohorts were 41.7%, 38.4%, and 36.2%, respectively. Five 
      predictors were age, sex, endotracheal tube cuff pressure, endotracheal tube 
      insertion depth, and the time interval between extubation and the first drinking 
      of water after extubation. After incorporating these variables, the NN model 
      demonstrated superior generalization capabilities in predicting POST when 
      compared to the XGBoost and RF models in external validation, achieving an area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.81 (95% CI 
      0.74-0.89) and a precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.77 (95% CI 0.66-0.86). The 
      model also showed good calibration and clinical usage values. The NN model 
      outperforms the XGBoost and RF models in predicting POST, with potential 
      applications in the healthcare industry for reducing the incidence of this common 
      postoperative complication.

TI  - Decision-making in anesthesiology: will artificial intelligence make 
      intraoperative care safer?
PG  - 691-697
LID - 10.1097/ACO.0000000000001318 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article explores the impact of recent applications of 
      artificial intelligence on clinical anesthesiologists' decision-making. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Naturalistic decision-making, a rich research field that aims to 
      understand how cognitive work is accomplished in complex environments, provides 
      insight into anesthesiologists' decision processes. Due to the complexity of 
      clinical work and limits of human decision-making (e.g. fatigue, distraction, and 
      cognitive biases), attention on the role of artificial intelligence to support 
      anesthesiologists' decision-making has grown. Artificial intelligence, a 
      computer's ability to perform human-like cognitive functions, is increasingly 
      used in anesthesiology. Examples include aiding in the prediction of 
      intraoperative hypotension and postoperative complications, as well as enhancing 
      structure localization for regional and neuraxial anesthesia through artificial 
      intelligence integration with ultrasound. SUMMARY: To fully realize the benefits 
      of artificial intelligence in anesthesiology, several important considerations 
      must be addressed, including its usability and workflow integration, appropriate 
      level of trust placed on artificial intelligence, its impact on decision-making, 
      the potential de-skilling of practitioners, and issues of accountability. Further 
      research is needed to enhance anesthesiologists' clinical decision-making in 
      collaboration with artificial intelligence.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and its clinical application in Anesthesiology: a 
      systematic review.
LID - 10.1007/s10877-023-01088-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is quickly 
      expanding. Despite the amount of evidence and promising results, a thorough 
      overview of the current state of AI in clinical practice of anesthesiology is 
      needed. Therefore, our study aims to systematically review the application of AI 
      in this context. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      guidelines. We searched Medline and Web of Science for articles published up to 
      November 2022 using terms related with AI and clinical practice of 
      anesthesiology. Articles that involved animals, editorials, reviews and sample 
      size lower than 10 patients were excluded. Characteristics and accuracy measures 
      from each study were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 46 articles were included in 
      this review. We have grouped them into 4 categories with regard to their clinical 
      applicability: (1) Depth of Anesthesia Monitoring; (2) Image-guided techniques 
      related to Anesthesia; (3) Prediction of events/risks related to Anesthesia; (4) 
      Drug administration control. Each group was analyzed, and the main findings were 
      summarized. Across all fields, the majority of AI methods tested showed superior 
      performance results compared to traditional methods. CONCLUSION: AI systems are 
      being integrated into anesthesiology clinical practice, enhancing medical 
      professionals' skills of decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and therapeutic 
      response.

TI  - Medical Informatics Operating Room Vitals and Events Repository (MOVER): a 
      public-access operating room database.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming the 
      healthcare industry. However, despite its potential, AI is yet to see widespread 
      deployment in clinical settings in significant part due to the lack of publicly 
      available clinical data and the lack of transparency in the published AI 
      algorithms. There are few clinical data repositories publicly accessible to 
      researchers to train and test AI algorithms, and even fewer that contain 
      specialized data from the perioperative setting. To address this gap, we present 
      and release the Medical Informatics Operating Room Vitals and Events Repository 
      (MOVER). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This first release of MOVER includes adult 
      patients who underwent surgery at the University of California, Irvine Medical 
      Center from 2015 to 2022. Data for patients who underwent surgery were captured 
      from 2 different sources: High-fidelity physiological waveforms from all of the 
      operating rooms were captured in real time and matched with electronic medical 
      record data. RESULTS: MOVER includes data from 58 799 unique patients and 83 468 
      surgeries. MOVER is available for download at https://doi.org/10.24432/C5VS5G, it 
      can be downloaded by anyone who signs a data usage agreement (DUA), to restrict 
      traffic to legitimate researchers. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge MOVER 
      is the only freely available public data repository that contains electronic 
      health record and high-fidelity physiological waveforms data for patients 
      undergoing surgery. CONCLUSION: MOVER is freely available to all researchers who 
      sign a DUA, and we hope that it will accelerate the integration of AI into 
      healthcare settings, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.

TI  - Machine learning study of the extended drug-target interaction network informed 
      by pain related voltage-gated sodium channels.
PG  - 908-921
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000003089 [doi]
AB  - Pain is a significant global health issue, and the current treatment options for 
      pain management have limitations in terms of effectiveness, side effects, and 
      potential for addiction. There is a pressing need for improved pain treatments 
      and the development of new drugs. Voltage-gated sodium channels, particularly 
      Nav1.3, Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9, play a crucial role in neuronal excitability 
      and are predominantly expressed in the peripheral nervous system. Targeting these 
      channels may provide a means to treat pain while minimizing central and cardiac 
      adverse effects. In this study, we construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
      networks based on pain-related sodium channels and develop a corresponding 
      drug-target interaction network to identify potential lead compounds for pain 
      management. To ensure reliable machine learning predictions, we carefully select 
      111 inhibitor data sets from a pool of more than 1000 targets in the PPI network. 
      We employ 3 distinct machine learning algorithms combined with advanced natural 
      language processing (NLP)-based embeddings, specifically pretrained transformer 
      and autoencoder representations. Through a systematic screening process, we 
      evaluate the side effects and repurposing potential of more than 150,000 drug 
      candidates targeting Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 sodium channels. In addition, we assess 
      the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) 
      properties of these candidates to identify leads with near-optimal 
      characteristics. Our strategy provides an innovative platform for the 
      pharmacological development of pain treatments, offering the potential for 
      improved efficacy and reduced side effects.

TI  - Intuitive movement-based prosthesis control enables arm amputees to reach 
      naturally in virtual reality.

AB  - Impressive progress is being made in bionic limbs design and control. Yet, 
      controlling the numerous joints of a prosthetic arm necessary to place the hand 
      at a correct position and orientation to grasp objects remains challenging. Here, 
      we designed an intuitive, movement-based prosthesis control that leverages 
      natural arm coordination to predict distal joints missing in people with 
      transhumeral limb loss based on proximal residual limb motion and knowledge of 
      the movement goal. This control was validated on 29 participants, including seven 
      with above-elbow limb loss, who picked and placed bottles in a wide range of 
      locations in virtual reality, with median success rates over 99% and movement 
      times identical to those of natural movements. This control also enabled 15 
      participants, including three with limb differences, to reach and grasp real 
      objects with a robotic arm operated according to the same principle. Remarkably, 
      this was achieved without any prior training, indicating that this control is 
      intuitive and instantaneously usable. It could be used for phantom limb pain 
      management in virtual reality, or to augment the reaching capabilities of 
      invasive neural interfaces usually more focused on hand and grasp control.

AB  - Long-term memories are formed by creating stable memory representations via 
      memory consolidation, which mainly occurs during sleep following the encoding of 
      labile memories in the hippocampus during waking. The entorhinal cortex (EC) has 
      intricate connections with the hippocampus, but its role in memory consolidation 
      is largely unknown. Using cell-type- and input-specific in vivo neural activity 
      recordings, here we show that the temporoammonic pathway neurons in the EC, which 
      directly innervate the output area of the hippocampus, exhibit potent oscillatory 
      activities during anesthesia and sleep. Using in vivo individual and populational 
      neuronal activity recordings, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of the 
      temporoammonic pathway neurons, which we termed sleep cells, generate delta 
      oscillations via hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels 
      during sleep. The blockade of these oscillations significantly impaired the 
      consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory. Together, our findings uncover a 
      key driver of delta oscillations and memory consolidation that are found in the 
      EC.

AB  - Machine learning tools have demonstrated viability in visualizing pain accurately

      investigate improving the accuracy by incorporating deviations from baseline 
      patient vital signs and the concurrence of the predicted artificial intelligence 
      values with the probability of critical care pain observation tool (CPOT) ≥ 3 
      after fentanyl administration. The study included adult patients in intensive 
      care who underwent multiple pain-related assessments. We employed a random forest 
      model, utilizing arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, gender, age, 
      and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score as explanatory variables. Pain was 
      measured as the probability of CPOT scores of ≥ 3, and subsequently adjusted 
      based on each patient's baseline. The study included 10,299 patients with 117,190 
      CPOT assessments. Of these, 3.3% had CPOT scores of ≥ 3. The random forest model 
      demonstrated strong accuracy with an area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve of 0.903. Patients treated with fentanyl were grouped based 
      on CPOT score improvement. Those with ≥ 1-h of improvement after fentanyl 
      administration had a significantly lower pain index (P = 0.020). Therefore, 
      incorporating deviations from baseline patient vital signs improved the accuracy 
      of pain visualization using machine learning techniques.

AB  - A third of all patients are at risk for a serious adverse event, including death, 
      in the first month after undergoing a major surgery. Most of these events will 
      occur within 24 hours of the operation but are unlikely to occur in the operating 
      room or postanesthesia care unit. Most opioid-induced respiratory depression 
      events in the postoperative period resulted in death (55%) or anoxic brain injury 
      (22%). A future state of mature artificial intelligence and machine learning will 
      improve situational awareness of acute clinical deterioration, minimize alert 
      fatigue, and facilitate early intervention to minimize poor outcomes.

AB  - Epidural anesthesia helps manage pain during different surgeries. Nonetheless, 
      the precise placement of the epidural needle remains a challenge. In this study, 
      we developed a probe based on polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography 
      (PS-OCT) to enhance the epidural anesthesia needle placement. The probe was 
      tested on six porcine spinal samples. The multimodal imaging guidance used the 
      OCT intensity mode and three distinct PS-OCT modes: (1) phase retardation, (2) 
      optic axis, and (3) degree of polarization uniformity (DOPU). Each mode enabled 
      the classification of different epidural tissues through distinct imaging 
      characteristics. To further streamline the tissue recognition procedure, 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to autonomously identify the tissue 
      types within the probe's field of view. ResNet50 models were developed for all 
      four imaging modes. DOPU imaging was found to provide the highest cross-testing 
      accuracy of 91.53%. These results showed the improved precision by PS-OCT in 
      guiding epidural anesthesia needle placement.

LID - e45038
AB  - In the field of anaesthesia, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a 
      game-changing technology. Applications of AI include keeping records, monitoring 
      patients, calculating and administering drugs, and carrying out mechanical 
      procedures. This article explores the current uses, challenges, and prospective 
      applications of AI in anaesthesia practices. This review discusses AI-supported 
      systems like anaesthesia information management systems (AIMS), mechanical robots 
      for carrying out procedures, and pharmacological models for drug delivery. AIMS 
      has helped in automated record-keeping, predicting bad events, and monitoring the 
      vital signs of the patient. Their application has a vital role in improving the 
      efficacy of anaesthesia management and patient safety. The application of AI in 
      anaesthesia comes with its own unique difficulties. Noteworthy obstacles include 
      issues with data quantity and quality, technical limitations, and moral and legal 
      dilemmas. The key to overcoming these barriers is to set guidelines for the 
      ethical use of AI in healthcare, improve the reliability and comprehension of AI 
      systems, and certify the health data precision and security. AI has very bright 
      potential. Exciting future directions include developments in AI and machine 
      learning thus development of new applications, and the possible enhancement in 
      training and education. Potential research areas include the application of AI to 
      chronic disease management, pain management, and the reinforcement of 
      anaesthesiologists' education. AI could be used to design authentic lifelike 
      training simulations and individualized student feedback systems, hence 
      transforming anaesthesia education and training methodology. For this review, we 
      conducted a PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Database search in 2022-2023 and 
      retrieved articles on AI and its uses in anaesthesia. Recommendations for future 
      research and development include strengthening the safety and reliability of 
      health data, building a better understanding of AI systems, and looking into new 
      areas of use. The power of AI can be used to innovate anaesthesia practices by 
      concentrating on these areas.

TI  - Evaluation of children's oral diagnosis and treatment using imaging examination 
      using AI based Internet of Things.
LID - 10.3233/THC-230099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) plays an important role 
      in the diagnosis and treatment of oral diseases, its image segmentation method 
      needs to be further improved, and there are still objections about the clinical 
      application effect of general anesthesia (GA) on children's dental fear (CDF). 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the application value of CBCT based on 
      intelligent computer segmentation model in oral diagnosis and treatment of 
      children in the context of biomedical signals, and to analyze the alleviating 
      effect of GA on CDF. METHODS: Based on the regional level set (CV) algorithm, the 
      local binary fitting (LBF) model was introduced to optimize it, and the tooth 
      CBCT image segmentation model CV-LBF was established to compare the segmentation 
      accuracy (SA), maximum symmetric surface distance (MSSD), average symmetric 
      surface distance (ASSD), over segmentation rate (OR), and under segmentation rate 
      (UR) between these model and other algorithms. 82 children with CDF were divided 
      into general anesthesia group (GAG) (n= 38) and controls (n= 44) according to the 
      voluntary principle of their families. Children in GAG were treated with GA and 
      controls with protective fixed intervention. Children's fear survey 
      schedule-dental subscale (CFSS-DS) and Venham scores were counted before 
      intervention in the two groups. CFSS-DS scores were recorded at 2 hours after 
      intervention and after recovery in children in GAG. CFSS-DS and Venham scores 
      were performed in all children 1 week after surgery. RESULTS: The results showed 
      that the S⁢A value of CV-LBF algorithm was higher than that of region growing 
      algorithm (P< 0.05). OR, UR, MSSD, and ASSD values of CV-LBF algorithm were 
      evidently lower than those of other algorithms (P< 0.05). CFSS-DS scores were 
      lower in GAG than in controls 2 hours after intervention and at return visits 
      after 1 week of intervention (P< 0.001), and Venham scores were lower in GAG than 
      in controls after intervention (P< 0.001). After intervention, the proportion of 
      children with Venham grade 0, 1, 2, and 3 was obviously higher in GAG than in 
      controls (P< 0.001), while the proportion of children with Venham grade 4 and 5 
      was clearly higher in controls than in GAG (P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results 
      revealed that the computer intelligent segmentation model CV-LBF has potential 
      application value in CBCT image segmentation of children's teeth, and GA can 
      effectively alleviate anxiety of children with CDF and can be used as biomedical 
      signals.

      anesthesia has brought about transformative changes in acute pain management for 
      surgical procedures. This review explores the evolving landscape of AI and 
      robotics applications in regional anesthesia, outlining their potential benefits, 
      challenges, and ethical considerations. AI-driven pain assessment, real-time 
      guidance for needle placement during nerve blocks, and predictive modeling 
      solutions for nerve blocks have the potential to enhance procedural precision and 
      improve patient outcomes. Robotic technology aids in accurate needle insertion, 
      reducing complications and improving pain relief. This review also highlights the 
      ethical and safety considerations surrounding AI implementation, emphasizing data 
      security and professional training. While challenges such as costs and regulatory 
      hurdles exist, ongoing research and clinical trials demonstrate the practical 
      utility of these technologies. In conclusion, AI and robotics have the potential 
      to reshape regional anesthesia practice, ultimately improving patient care and 
      procedural accuracy in pain management.

TI  - Predicting optimal endotracheal tube size and depth in pediatric patients using 
      demographic data and machine learning techniques.
PG  - 540-549
LID - 10.4097/kja.23501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) with appropriate size and depth can 
      help minimize intubation-related complications in pediatric patients. Existing 
      age-based formulae for selecting the optimal ETT size present several 
      inaccuracies. We developed a machine learning model that predicts the optimal 
      size and depth of ETTs in pediatric patients using demographic data, enabling 
      clinical applications. METHODS: Data from 37,057 patients younger than 12 years 
      who underwent general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were 
      retrospectively analyzed. Gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) model was 
      developed and compared with traditional age-based formulae. RESULTS: The GBRT 
      model demonstrated the highest macro-averaged F1 scores of 0.502 (95% CI 0.486, 
      0.568) and 0.669 (95% CI 0.640, 0.694) for predicting the uncuffed and cuffed ETT 
      size (internal diameter [ID]), outperforming the age-based formulae that yielded 
      0.163 (95% CI 0.140, 0.196, P < 0.001) and 0.392 (95% CI 0.378, 0.406, P < 
      0.001), respectively. In predicting the ETT depth (distance from tip to lip 
      corner), the GBRT model showed the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.71 cm 
      (95% CI 0.69, 0.72) and 0.72 cm (95% CI 0.70, 0.74) compared to the age-based 
      formulae that showed an error of 1.18 cm (95% CI 1.16, 1.20, P < 0.001) and 1.34 
      cm (95% CI 1.31, 1.38, P < 0.001) for uncuffed and cuffed ETT, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The GBRT model using only demographic data accurately predicted the 
      ETT size and depth. If these results are validated, the model may be practical 
      for predicting optimal ETT size and depth for pediatric patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Digital therapeutics (DT) emerged and has been expanding rapidly 
      for pain management. However, the efficacy of such approaches demonstrates 
      substantial heterogeneity. Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a great 
      opportunity for personalizing the efficacy of DT. However, the ML model accuracy 
      is mainly associated with reduced clinical interpretability. Moreover, classical 
      ML models are not adapted for the longitudinal nature of the DT follow-up data, 
      which may also include nonlinear fluctuations. OBJECTIVES: This study presents an 
      analytical framework for personalized pain management using piecewise 
      mixed-effects model trees, considering the data dependencies, nonlinear 
      trajectories, and boosting model interpretability. METHODS: We demonstrated the 
      implementation of the model with posture biofeedback training data of 3610 users 
      collected during 8 weeks. The users reported their pain levels and posture 
      quality. We developed personalized models for nonlinear time-related fluctuations 
      of pain levels, posture quality, and weekly training duration using age, gender, 
      and body mass index as potential moderating factors. RESULTS: Pain levels and 
      posture quality demonstrated strong improvement during the first 3 weeks of the 
      training, followed by a sustained pattern. The age of the users moderated the 
      time fluctuations in pain levels, whereas age and gender interactively moderated 
      the trajectories in the posture quality. Train duration increased during the 
      first 3 weeks only for older users, whereas all the users decreased the training 
      duration during the next 5 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This analytical framework offers 
      an opportunity for investigating the personalized efficacy of digital 
      therapeutics for pain management, taking into account users' characteristics and 
      boosting interpretability and can benefit from including more users' 
      characteristics.

AB  - Pain is both one of the oldest complaints known to medicine and a field for some 
      of medicine's latest breakthroughs and innovations. Pharmacologic treatment of 
      pain is one of the oldest remedies, and opioids have been used since ancient 
      times as an effective pain reliever but with certain specific risks for 
      abuse. Greater knowledge of opioids led to a more thorough understanding of the 
      complexities of pain, which may have any number of mechanisms. A greater 
      understanding of nerve fibers and pain signaling led to the development of more 
      drugs and the more targeted delivery of analgesics using the hollow needle. The 
      hollow needle changed pain treatment and led to percutaneous injections and what 
      would later become interventional pain medicine with regional anesthesia and 
      nerve blocks. Today, imaging can be combined with interventional techniques for 
      more precise localization of nerves for diagnosis and treatment. The role of 
      artificial intelligence in interventional pain medicine, especially in imaging 
      for interventional procedures, remains unknown but will likely become extremely 
      beneficial.

AB  - Neonatal Facial Pain Assessment (NFPA) is essential to improve neonatal pain 
      management. Pose variation and occlusion, which can significantly alter the 
      facial appearance, are two major and still unstudied barriers to NFPA. We bridge 
      this gap in terms of method and dataset. Techniques to tackle both challenges in 
      other tasks either expect pose/occlusion-invariant deep learning methods or first 
      generate a normal version of the input image before feature extraction, combining 
      these we argue that it is more effective to jointly perform adversarial learning 
      and end-to-end classification for their mutual benefit. To this end, we propose a 
      Pose-invariant Occlusion-robust Pain Assessment (POPA) framework, with two 
      novelties. We incorporate adversarial learning-based disturbance mitigation for 
      end-to-end pain-level classification and propose a novel composite loss function 
      for facial representation learning; compared to the vanilla discriminator that 
      implicitly determines occlusion and pose conditions, we propose a multi-scale 
      discriminator that determines explicitly, while incorporating local 
      discriminators to enhance the discrimination of key regions. For a comprehensive 
      evaluation, we built the first neonatal pain dataset with disturbance annotation 
      involving 1091 neonates and also applied the proposed POPA to the facial 
      expression recognition task. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments 
      prove the superiority of the POPA.

AB  - Machine vision describes the use of artificial intelligence to interpret, 
      analyze, and derive predictions from image or video data. Machine vision-based 
      techniques are already in clinical use in radiology, ophthalmology, and 
      dermatology, where some applications currently equal or exceed the performance of 
      specialty physicians in areas of image interpretation. While machine vision in 
      anesthesia has many potential applications, its development remains in its 
      infancy in our specialty. Early research for machine vision in anesthesia has 
      focused on automated recognition of anatomical structures during 
      ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia or line insertion; recognition of the 
      glottic opening and vocal cords during video laryngoscopy; prediction of the 
      difficult airway using facial images; and clinical alerts for endobronchial 
      intubation detected on chest radiograph. Current machine vision applications 
      measuring the distance between endotracheal tube tip and carina have demonstrated 
      noninferior performance compared to board-certified physicians. The performance 
      and potential uses of machine vision for anesthesia will only grow with the 
      advancement of underlying machine vision algorithm technical performance 
      developed outside of medicine, such as convolutional neural networks and transfer 
      learning. This article summarizes recently published works of interest, provides 
      a brief overview of techniques used to create machine vision applications, 
      explains frequently used terms, and discusses challenges the specialty will 
      encounter as we embrace the advantages that this technology may bring to future 
      clinical practice and patient care. As machine vision emerges onto the clinical 
      stage, it is critically important that anesthesiologists are prepared to 
      confidently assess which of these devices are safe, appropriate, and bring added 
      value to patient care.

TI  - Envisioning gamification in anesthesia, pain management, and critical care: basic 
      principles, integration of artificial intelligence, and simulation strategies.

AB  - Unlike traditional video games developed solely for entertainment purposes, 
      game-based learning employs intentionally crafted approaches that seamlessly 
      merge entertainment and educational content, resulting in captivating and 
      effective learning encounters. These pedagogical methods include serious video 
      games and gamification. Serious games are video games utilized as tools for 
      acquiring crucial (serious) knowledge and skills. On the other hand, gamification 
      requires integrating gaming elements (game mechanics) such as points, 
      leaderboards, missions, levels, rewards, and more, into a context that may not be 
      associated with video gaming activities. They can be dynamically (game dynamics) 
      combined developing various strategic approaches. Operatively, gamification 
      adopts simulation elements and leverages the interactive nature of gaming to 
      teach players specific skills, convey knowledge, or address real-world issues. 
      External incentives stimulate internal motivation. Therefore, these techniques 
      place the learners in the central role, allowing them to actively construct 
      knowledge through firsthand experiences.Anesthesia, pain medicine, and critical 
      care demand a delicate interplay of technical competence and non-technical 
      proficiencies. Gamification techniques can offer advantages to both domains. 
      Game-based modalities provide a dynamic, interactive, and highly effective 
      opportunity to learn, practice, and improve both technical and non-technical 
      skills, enriching the overall proficiency of anesthesia professionals. These 
      properties are crucial in a discipline where personal skills, human factors, and 
      the influence of stressors significantly impact daily work activities. 
      Furthermore, gamification can also be embraced for patient education to enhance 
      comfort and compliance, particularly within pediatric settings (game-based 
      distraction), and in pain medicine through stress management techniques. On these 
      bases, the creation of effective gamification tools for anesthesiologists can 
      present a formidable opportunity for users and developers.This narrative review 
      comprehensively examines the intricate aspects of gamification and its 
      potentially transformative influence on the fields of anesthesiology. It delves 
      into theoretical frameworks, potential advantages in education and training, 
      integration with artificial intelligence systems and immersive techniques, and 
      also addresses the challenges that could arise within these contexts.

AB  - Chat generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) is a chatbot developed by 
      OpenAI that answers questions in a human-like manner. ChatGPT is a GPT language 
      model that understands and responds to natural language created using a 
      transformer, which is a new artificial neural network algorithm first introduced 
      by Google in 2017. ChatGPT can be used to identify research topics and proofread 
      English writing and R scripts to improve work efficiency and optimize time. 
      Attempts to actively utilize generative artificial intelligence (AI) are expected 
      to continue in clinical settings. However, ChatGPT still has many limitations for 
      widespread use in clinical research, owing to AI hallucination symptoms and its 
      training data constraints. Researchers recommend avoiding scientific writing 
      using ChatGPT in many traditional journals because of the current lack of 
      originality guidelines and plagiarism of content generated by ChatGPT. Further 
      regulations and discussions on these topics are expected in the future.

TI  - Clusters of medical specialties around patients with multimorbidity - employing 
      fuzzy c-means clustering to explore multidisciplinary collaboration.
PG  - 975
LID - 10.1186/s12913-023-09961-z [doi]
LID - 975
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital care organization, structured around medical specialties and 
      focused on the separate treatment of individual organ systems, is challenged by 
      the increasing prevalence of multimorbidity. To support the hospitals' 
      realization of multidisciplinary care, we hypothesized that using machine 
      learning on clinical data helps to identify groups of medical specialties who are 
      simultaneously involved in hospital care for patients with multimorbidity. 
      METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients in a Dutch general 
      hospital and used a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm for the analysis. We 
      explored the patients' membership degrees in each cluster to identify subgroups 
      of medical specialties that provide care to the same patients with 
      multimorbidity. We used retrospectively collected electronic health record data 
      from 2017. We extracted data from 22,133 patients aged ≥18 years who had received 
      outpatient clinical care for two or more chronic and/ or oncological diagnoses. 
      RESULTS: We found six clusters of medical specialties and identified 22 
      subgroups. The clusters were labeled based on the specialties that most 
      characterized them: 1. dermatology/ plastic surgery, 2. six specialties 
      (gynecology/ rheumatology/ orthopedic surgery/ urology/ gastroenterology/ 
      otorhinolaryngology), 3. pulmonology, 4. internal medicine/ cardiology/ 
      geriatrics, 5. neurology/ physiatry (rehabilitation)/ anesthesiology, and 6. 
      internal medicine. Most patients had a full or dominant membership to one of 
      these clusters of medical specialties (11 subgroups), whereas fewer patients had 
      a membership to two clusters. The prevalence of specific diagnosis groups, 
      patient characteristics, and healthcare utilization differed between subgroups. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study shows that clusters and subgroups of medical specialties 
      simultaneously involved in hospital care for patients with multimorbidity can be 
      identified with fuzzy c-means cluster analysis using clinical data. Clusters and 
      subgroups differed regarding the involved medical specialties, diagnoses, patient 
      characteristics, and healthcare utilization. With this strategy, hospitals and 
      medical specialists can further analyze which subgroups are target populations 
      that might benefit from improved multidisciplinary collaboration.

TI  - Recent Trends and Hotspots in Hip Arthroplasty: A Bibliometric Analysis and 
      Visualization Study of Last Five-Year Publications.
PG  - 493-501
LID - 10.22038/ABJS.2023.70790.3313 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bibliometric analysis is one of the most prevalent methods for 
      analyzing and predicting research trends of particular subjects. Through a 
      bibliometric analysis, the present study sought to look into and depict the 
      hotspots and research trends in hip arthroplasty research over the previous five 
      years. METHODS: The Web of Science Core Collection database was used to find 
      studies on hip arthroplasty published between 2018 and 2022. The VOS viewer, Cite 
      Space, and Bibliometrix were used to carry out the bibliometric study and network 
      visualization. RESULTS: During the last five years, 5,708 hip arthroplasty 
      publications were cited 40,765 times. The United States and the Journal of 
      Arthroplasty were the top countries and journals regarding the number of studies, 
      respectively. The top 10 global high-impact documents were determined using the 
      citation ranking and citation burst. The most frequently referenced research 
      revealed the epidemiological aspects of hip arthroplasty, perioperative care 
      after hip arthroplasty, COVID-19, periprosthetic joint infections, opioid 
      medicines, stability, and osteonecrosis were the hot topics in hip arthroplasty 
      research. Keyword burst analysis showed that the research trends in hip 
      arthroplasty through 2022 were patient-reported outcome measures (PROM), 
      depression, racial disparity, and artificial intelligence (AI). The analysis of 
      the subject areas revealed the close connections and relationships between 
      different subject areas, as demonstrated by the figures. CONCLUSION: The hip 
      arthroplasty research community is very productive and highly centralized. 
      Periprosthetic joint infection, dual-mobility cups, spinopelvic mobility, direct 
      anterior approach, outpatient total hip arthroplasty, polyethylene, 
      periprosthetic fracture, acetabular defects, tranexamic acid, developmental

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proper maintenance of hypnosis is crucial for ensuring the safety of 
      patients undergoing surgery. Accordingly, indicators, such as the Bispectral 
      index (BIS), have been developed to monitor hypnotic levels. However, the 
      black-box nature of the algorithm coupled with the hardware makes it challenging 
      to understand the underlying mechanisms of the algorithms and integrate them with 
      other monitoring systems, thereby limiting their use. OBJECTIVE: We propose an 
      interpretable deep learning model that forecasts BIS values 25 s in advance using 
      30 s electroencephalogram (EEG) data. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The proposed model 
      utilized EEG data as a predictor, which is then decomposed into amplitude and 
      phase components using fast Fourier Transform. An attention mechanism was applied 
      to interpret the importance of these components in predicting BIS. The 
      predictability of the model was evaluated on both regression and binary 
      classification tasks, where the former involved predicting a continuous BIS 
      value, and the latter involved classifying a dichotomous status at a BIS value of 
      60. To evaluate the interpretability of the model, we analyzed the attention 
      values expressed in the amplitude and phase components according to five ranges 
      of BIS values. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using datasets 
      collected from two separate medical institutions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The 
      proposed model achieved excellent performance on both the internal and external 
      validation datasets. The model achieved a root-mean-square error of 6.614 for the 
      regression task, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 
      0.937 for the binary classification task. Interpretability analysis provided 
      insight into the relationship between EEG frequency components and BIS values. 
      Specifically, the attention mechanism revealed that higher BIS values were 
      associated with increased amplitude attention values in high-frequency bands and 
      increased phase attention values in various frequency bands. This finding is 
      expected to facilitate a more profound understanding of the BIS prediction 
      mechanism, thereby contributing to the advancement of anesthesia technologies.

      Classification from preoperative clinical text narratives using natural language

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHR) contain large volumes of unstructured 
      free-form text notes that richly describe a patient's health and medical 
      comorbidities. It is unclear if perioperative risk stratification can be 
      performed directly from these notes without manual data extraction. We conduct a 
      feasibility study using natural language processing (NLP) to predict the American 
      Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification (ASA-PS) as a 
      surrogate measure for perioperative risk. We explore prediction performance using 
      four different model types and compare the use of different note sections versus 
      the whole note. We use Shapley values to explain model predictions and analyze 
      disagreement between model and human anesthesiologist predictions. METHODS: 
      Single-center retrospective cohort analysis of EHR notes from patients undergoing 
      procedures with anesthesia care spanning all procedural specialties during a 
      5 year period who were not assigned ASA VI and also had a preoperative evaluation 
      note filed within 90 days prior to the procedure. NLP models were trained for 
      each combination of 4 models and 8 text snippets from notes. Model performance 
      was compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 
      and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC). Shapley values were used to 
      explain model predictions. Error analysis and model explanation using Shapley 
      values was conducted for the best performing model. RESULTS: Final dataset 
      includes 38,566 patients undergoing 61,503 procedures with anesthesia care. 
      Prevalence of ASA-PS was 8.81% for ASA I, 31.4% for ASA II, 43.25% for ASA III, 
      and 16.54% for ASA IV-V. The best performing models were the BioClinicalBERT 
      model on the truncated note task (macro-average AUROC 0.845) and the fastText 
      model on the full note task (macro-average AUROC 0.865). Shapley values reveal 
      human-interpretable model predictions. Error analysis reveals that some original 
      ASA-PS assignments may be incorrect and the model is making a reasonable 
      prediction in these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Text classification models can accurately 
      predict a patient's illness severity using only free-form text descriptions of 
      patients without any manual data extraction. They can be an additional patient 
      safety tool in the perioperative setting and reduce manual chart review for 
      medical billing. Shapley feature attributions produce explanations that logically 
      support model predictions and are understandable to clinicians.

PG  - 781-788
LID - 10.1002/mus.27963 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Needle impedance-electromyography (iEMG) assesses the active 
      and passive electrical properties of muscles concurrently by using a novel needle 
      with six electrodes, two for EMG and four for electrical impedance myography 
      (EIM). Here, we assessed an approach for combining multifrequency EMG and EIM 
      data via machine learning (ML) to discriminate D2-mdx muscular dystrophy and 
      wild-type (WT) mouse skeletal muscle. METHODS: iEMG data were obtained from 
      quadriceps of D2-mdx mice, a muscular dystrophy model, and WT animals. EIM data 
      were collected with the animals under deep anesthesia and EMG data collected 
      under light anesthesia, allowing for limited spontaneous movement. Fourier 
      transformation was performed on the EMG data to provide power spectra that were 
      sampled across the frequency range using three different approaches. Random 
      forest-based, nested ML was applied to the EIM and EMG data sets separately and 
      then together to assess healthy versus disease category classification using a 
      nested cross-validation procedure. RESULTS: Data from 20 D2-mdx and 20 WT limbs 
      were analyzed. EIM data fared better than EMG data in differentiating healthy 
      from disease mice with 93.1% versus 75.6% accuracy, respectively. Combining EIM 
      and EMG data sets yielded similar performance as EIM data alone with 92.2% 
      accuracy. DISCUSSION: We have demonstrated an ML-based approach for combining EIM 
      and EMG data obtained with an iEMG needle. While EIM-EMG in combination fared no 
      better than EIM alone with this data set, the approach used here demonstrates a 
      novel method of combining the two techniques to characterize the full electrical 
      properties of skeletal muscle.

TI  - An Interpretable Longitudinal Preeclampsia Risk Prediction Using Machine 
      Learning.

LID - 10.1101/2023.08.16.23293946 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disease characterized by new 
      onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation that affects 2-8% of all 
      pregnancies and contributes to up to 26% of maternal deaths. Despite extensive 
      clinical research, current predictive tools fail to identify up to 66% of 
      patients who will develop preeclampsia. We sought to develop a tool to 
      longitudinally predict preeclampsia risk. METHODS: In this retrospective model 
      development and validation study, we examined a large cohort of patients who 
      delivered at six community and two tertiary care hospitals in the New England 
      region between 02/2015 and 06/2023. We used sociodemographic, clinical diagnoses, 
      family history, laboratory, and vital signs data. We developed eight datasets at 
      14, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 39 weeks gestation and at the hospital admission for 
      delivery. We created linear regression, random forest, xgboost, and deep neural 
      networks to develop multiple models and compared their performance. We used 
      Shapley values to investigate the global and local explainability of the models 
      and the relationships between the predictive variables. FINDINGS: Our study 
      population (N=120,752) had an incidence of preeclampsia of 5.7% (N=6,920). The 
      performance of the models as measured using the area under the curve, AUC, was in 
      the range 0.73-0.91, which was externally validated. The relationships between 
      some of the variables were complex and non-linear; in addition, the relative 
      significance of the predictors varied over the pregnancy. Compared to the current 
      standard of care for preeclampsia risk stratification in the first trimester, our 
      model would allow 48.6% more at-risk patients to be identified. INTERPRETATION: 
      Our novel preeclampsia prediction tool would allow clinicians to identify 
      patients at risk early and provide personalized predictions, as well as 
      longitudinal predictions throughout pregnancy. FUNDING: National Institutes of 
      Health, Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence 
      before this study: Current tools for the prediction of preeclampsia are lacking 
      as they fail to identify up to 66% of the patients who develop preeclampsia. We 
      searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Web of Science from database inception to May 
      1, 2023, using the keywords "deep learning", "machine learning", "preeclampsia", 
      "artificial intelligence", "pregnancy complications", and "predictive models". We 
      identified 13 studies that employed machine learning to develop prediction models 
      for preeclampsia risk based on clinical variables. Among these studies, six 
      included biomarkers such as serum placental growth factor, pregnancy-associated 
      plasma protein A, and uterine artery pulsatility index, which are not routinely 
      available in our clinical practice; two studies were in diverse cohorts of more 
      than 100 000 patients, and two studies developed longitudinal predictions using 
      medical records data. However, most studies have limited depth, concerns about 
      data leakage, overfitting, or lack of generalizability.Added value of this study: 
      We developed a comprehensive longitudinal predictive tool based on routine 
      clinical data that can be used throughout pregnancy to predict the risk of 
      preeclampsia. We tested multiple types of predictive models, including machine 
      learning and deep learning models, and demonstrated high predictive power. We 
      investigated the changes over different time points of individual and group 
      variables and found previously known and novel relationships between variables 
      such as red blood cell count and preeclampsia risk.Implications of all the 
      available evidence: Longitudinal prediction of preeclampsia using machine 
      learning can be achieved with high performance. Implementation of an accurate 
      predictive tool within the electronic health records can aid clinical care and 
      identify patients at heightened risk who would benefit from aspirin prophylaxis, 
      increased surveillance, early diagnosis, and escalation in care. These results 
      highlight the potential of using artificial intelligence in clinical decision 
      support, with the ultimate goal of reducing iatrogenic preterm birth and 
      improving perinatal care.

TI  - Optimized workflow for pulmonary vein isolation using 90-W radiofrequency 
      applications: a comparative study.
PG  - 353-361
LID - 10.1007/s10840-023-01630-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ninety-watt applications are more sensitive to catheter instability 
      and produce lesions that are shallower and smaller in diameter than 50-W 
      applications. These characteristics were considered for the development of a 
      combined (90-50 W) pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) strategy which was 
      prospectively compared to a 50 W-only ablation index (AI)-guided PVI strategy. 
      METHODS: One hundred fifty consecutive paroxysmal AF patients underwent PVI under 
      general anesthesia using CARTO. In the first 75 patients, PVI was performed with 
      a combined (90-50 W) strategy using the QDOT-MICRO catheter in a 
      temperature-controlled mode. This strategy consisted of 90 W-4 s applications on 
      the posterior LA wall (at sites of catheter stability and expectedly thin atrial 
      tissue) with an interlesion distance (ILD) ≤ 4 mm and 50-W applications elsewhere 
      (at sites of catheter instability or expectedly thick atrial tissue) with 
      ILD < 6 mm. In the subsequent 75 patients, PVI was performed with a 50 W-only 
      AI-guided strategy using the SmartTouch-SF catheter in a power-controlled mode. 
      RESULTS: Both groups of patients had similar clinical characteristics and LA 
      dimensions (123.1 ± 24.9 ml vs 119 ± 26.8 ml, P = 0.33). Total procedural times 
      (61 [56-70] vs 65 [60-75] min, P = 0.12), first-pass PVI (82.6 vs 80%, P = 0.81), 
      acute PV reconnection (0 vs 6.6%, P = 0.05), and 1-year SR maintenance (93.3 vs 
      90.6%, P = 0.57) rates were also similar in both groups of patients. There were 
      no complications in the combined (90-50 W) group while only 2 groin hematomas 
      were reported in the 50 W group. CONCLUSIONS: In paroxysmal AF patients, a 
      combined (90-50 W) strategy for PVI did not improve safety, efficiency, or 
      effectiveness compared to a 50 W-only AI-guided strategy.

TI  - Geometric morphometrics and machine learning from three-dimensional facial scans 
      for difficult mask ventilation prediction.
PG  - 1203023
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2023.1203023 [doi]
LID - 1203023
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unanticipated difficult mask ventilation (DMV) is a potentially 
      life-threatening event in anesthesia. Nevertheless, predicting DMV currently 
      remains a challenge. This study aimed to verify whether three dimensional (3D) 
      facial scans could predict DMV in patients scheduled for general anesthesia. 
      METHODS: The 3D facial scans were taken on 669 adult patients scheduled for 
      elective surgery under general anesthesia. Clinical variables currently used as 
      predictors of DMV were also collected. The DMV was defined as the inability to 
      provide adequate and stable ventilation. Spatially dense landmarks were digitized 
      on 3D scans to describe sufficient details for facial features and then processed 
      by 3D geometric morphometrics. Ten different machine learning (ML) algorithms, 
      varying from simple to more advanced, were introduced. The performance of ML 
      models for DMV prediction was compared with that of the DIFFMASK score. The area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) with its 95% confidence 
      interval (95% CI) as well as the specificity and sensitivity were used to 
      evaluate the predictive value of the model. RESULTS: The incidence of DMV was 
      35/669 (5.23%). The logistic regression (LR) model performed best among the 10 ML 
      models. The AUC of the LR model was 0.825 (95% CI, 0.765-0.885). The sensitivity 
      and specificity of the model were 0.829 (95% CI, 0.629-0.914) and 0.733 (95% CI, 
      0.532-0.819), respectively. The LR model demonstrated better predictive 
      performance than the DIFFMASK score, which obtained an AUC of 0.785 (95% CI, 
      0.710-0.860) and a sensitivity of 0.686 (95% CI, 0.578-0.847). Notably, we 
      identified a significant morphological difference in the mandibular region 
      between the DMV group and the easy mask ventilation group. CONCLUSION: Our study 
      indicated a distinct morphological difference in the mandibular region between 
      the DMV group and the easy mask ventilation group. 3D geometric morphometrics 
      with ML could be a rapid, efficient, and non-invasive tool for DMV prediction to 
      improve anesthesia safety.

TI  - Video-Based versus On-Site Neonatal Pain Assessment in Neonatal Intensive Care 
      Units: The Impact of Video-Based Neonatal Pain Assessment in Real-World Scenario 
      on Pain Diagnosis and Its Artificial Intelligence Application.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13162661 [doi]
LID - 2661
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal pain assessment (NPA) represents a huge global problem of 
      essential importance, as a timely and accurate assessment of neonatal pain is 
      indispensable for implementing pain management. PURPOSE: To investigate the 
      consistency of pain scores derived through video-based NPA (VB-NPA) and on-site 
      NPA (OS-NPA), providing the scientific foundation and feasibility of adopting 
      VB-NPA results in a real-world scenario as the gold standard for neonatal pain in 
      clinical studies and labels for artificial intelligence (AI)-based NPA (AI-NPA) 
      applications. SETTING: A total of 598 neonates were recruited from a pediatric 
      hospital in China. METHODS: This observational study recorded 598 neonates who 
      underwent one of 10 painful procedures, including arterial blood sampling, heel 
      blood sampling, fingertip blood sampling, intravenous injection, subcutaneous 
      injection, peripheral intravenous cannulation, nasopharyngeal suctioning, 
      retention enema, adhesive removal, and wound dressing. Two experienced nurses 
      performed OS-NPA and VB-NPA at a 10-day interval through double-blind scoring 
      using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale to evaluate the pain level of the neonates. 
      Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were calculated and analyzed, and a 
      paired samples t-test was used to explore the bias and consistency of the 
      assessors' pain scores derived through OS-NPA and VB-NPA. The impact of different 
      label sources was evaluated using three state-of-the-art AI methods trained with 
      labels given by OS-NPA and VB-NPA, respectively. RESULTS: The intra-rater 
      reliability of the same assessor was 0.976-0.983 across different times, as 
      measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient. The inter-rater reliability 
      was 0.983 for single measures and 0.992 for average measures. No significant 
      differences were observed between the OS-NPA scores and the assessment of an 
      independent VB-NPA assessor. The different label sources only caused a limited 
      accuracy loss of 0.022-0.044 for the three AI methods. CONCLUSION: VB-NPA in a 
      real-world scenario is an effective way to assess neonatal pain due to its high 
      intra-rater and inter-rater reliability compared to OS-NPA and could be used for 
      the labeling of large-scale NPA video databases for clinical studies and AI 
      training.

AB  - This prospective randomized controlled trial investigated the clinical value of 
      sigmoid colon water exchange (SWE) colonoscopy by comparing it with air 
      insufflation (AI) colonoscopy in terms of the patient's pain score, insertion 
      time, and screening quality. Consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy 
      without sedation were randomized into an AI group (n = 267) or an SWE group 
      (n = 255). Patient characteristics, history of abdominal or pelvic surgery, 
      maximum pain score, insertion time, cecal intubation rate, polyp detection rate, 
      and the need for maneuvers were recorded. There was no significant between-group 
      difference in insertion time, cecal intubation rate, assisted maneuvers 
      (abdominal pressure, changing patients' position), or polyp detection rate 
      (P > 0.05). The mean maximum pain score was significantly lower in the SWE group 
      than in the AI group. (3.57 ± 2.01 vs. 4.69 ± 1.83, P < 0.001). For patients with 
      a history of abdominal or pelvic surgery and those who were overweight (body mass 
      index > 24), the maximum pain scores were lower in the SWE group than in the AI 
      group (3.67 ± 1.95 vs. 4.88 ± 1.80, P < 0.001; 3.40 ± 1.96 vs. 4.79 ± 
      1.97, P < 0.001, respectively). SWE colonoscopy can significantly reduce 
      abdominal pain with non-inferior screening quality and does not increase 
      insertion time.Trial registration number: ChiCTR2200059057 (date April 23, 2022).

TI  - Analgesia quality index improves the quality of postoperative pain management: a 
      retrospective observational study of 14,747 patients between 2014 and 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The application of artificial intelligence patient-controlled 
      analgesia (AI-PCA) facilitates the remote monitoring of analgesia management, the 
      implementation of mobile ward rounds, and the automatic recording of all types of 
      key data in the clinical setting. However, it cannot quantify the quality of 
      postoperative analgesia management. This study aimed to establish an index 
      (analgesia quality index (AQI)) to re-monitor and re-evaluate the system, 
      equipment, medical staff and degree of patient matching to quantify the quality 
      of postoperative pain management through machine learning. METHODS: Utilizing the 
      wireless analgesic pump system database of the Cancer Hospital Affiliated with 
      Nantong University, this retrospective observational study recruited consecutive 
      patients who underwent postoperative analgesia using AI-PCA from June 1, 2014, to 
      August 31, 2021. All patients were grouped according to whether or not the AQI 
      was used to guide the management of postoperative analgesia: The control group 
      did not receive the AQI guidance for postoperative analgesia and the experimental 
      group received the AQI guidance for postoperative analgesia. The primary outcome 
      was the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain (numeric rating scale (NRS) 
      score ≥ 4) and the second outcome was the incidence of total adverse reactions. 
      Furthermore, indicators of AQI were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 14,747 patients 
      were included in this current study. The incidence of moderate-to-severe pain was 
      26.3% in the control group and 21.7% in the experimental group. The estimated 
      ratio difference was 4.6% between the two groups (95% confidence interval [CI], 
      3.2% to 6.0%; P < 0.001). There were significant differences between groups. 
      Otherwise, the differences in the incidence of total adverse reactions between 
      the two groups were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the traditional 
      management of postoperative analgesia, application of the AQI decreased the 
      incidence of moderate-to-severe pain. Clinical application of the AQI contributes 
      to improving the quality of postoperative analgesia management and may provide 
      guidance for optimum pain management in the postoperative setting.

TI  - Technical evolution of pediatric neurosurgery: craniosynostosis from 1972 to 2023 
      and beyond.
PG  - 2779-2787
LID - 10.1007/s00381-023-06113-w [doi]
AB  - Very few clinical entities have undergone so many different treatment approaches 
      over such a short period of time as craniosynostosis. Surgical treatments for 
      this condition have ranged from simple linear craniectomies, accounting for the 
      specific role of cranial sutures in assuring the normal growth of the skull, to 
      more complex cranial vault reconstructions, based on the perceived role of the 
      skull base in affecting the growth of the skull. While a great deal of evolution 
      has occurred, there remains controversy regarding the ideal treatment including 
      the best surgical technique, the optimal age for surgery, and the long-term 
      morphological and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The evolution of the surgical 
      management of craniosynostosis in the last 50 years has been affected by several 
      factors. This includes the awareness of needing to operate on affected children 
      during infancy to achieve the best results, the use of multistage operations, the 
      availability of more sophisticated surgical tools, and improved perioperative 
      care. In some forms of craniosynostosis, the operations can be carried out at a 
      very young age with low morbidity, and with the postoperative use of a molding 
      helmet, springs, or distractors, these operations prove to be as effective as 
      traditional larger cranial reconstructions performed in older children. As a 
      consequence, complex surgical operations have become progressively less utilized. 
      A second relevant advance was the more recent advent of a molecular diagnosis, 
      which allowed us to understand the pathogenesis of some associated malformations 
      and neurodevelopmental issues that were observed in some children despite 
      appropriate surgical treatment. Future research should focus on improving the 
      analysis of longer-term outcomes and understanding the natural history of 
      craniofacial conditions, including what issues persist despite optimal surgical 
      correction. Progress in molecular investigations concerning the normal and 
      pathological development of cranial sutures could be a further significant step 
      in the management of craniosynostosis, possibly favoring a "medical" treatment in 
      the near future. Artificial intelligence will likely have a role in establishing 
      the diagnosis with less reliance on radiographic studies and in assisting with 
      surgical planning. Overall, much progress has been made, but there remains much 
      to do.

      Target-Controlled Infusion of Propofol and Remifentanil.
PG  - 3363-3374
LID - 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3305363 [doi]
AB  - Accurately predicting anesthetic effects is essential for target-controlled 
      infusion systems. The traditional (PK-PD) models for Bispectral index (BIS) 
      prediction require manual selection of model parameters, which can be challenging 
      in clinical settings. Recently proposed deep learning methods can only capture 
      general trends and may not predict abrupt changes in BIS. To address these 
      issues, we propose a transformer-based method for predicting the depth of 
      anesthesia (DOA) using drug infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Our method 
      employs long short-term memory (LSTM) and gate residual network (GRN) networks to 
      improve the efficiency of feature fusion and applies an attention mechanism to 
      discover the interactions between the drugs. We also use label distribution 
      smoothing and reweighting losses to address data imbalance. Experimental results 
      show that our proposed method outperforms traditional PK-PD models and previous 
      deep learning methods, effectively predicting anesthetic depth under sudden and 
      deep anesthesia conditions.

AB  - Ventilation should be assisted without asynchrony or cardiorespiratory 
      instability during anesthesia emergence until sufficient spontaneous ventilation 
      is recovered. In this multicenter cohort study, we develop and validate a 
      reinforcement learning-based Artificial Intelligence model for Ventilation 
      control during Emergence (AIVE) from general anesthesia. Ventilatory and 
      hemodynamic parameters from 14,306 surgical cases at an academic hospital between 
      2016 and 2019 are used for training and internal testing of the model. The 
      model's performance is also evaluated on the external validation cohort, which 
      includes 406 cases from another academic hospital in 2022. The estimated reward 
      of the model's policy is higher than that of the clinicians' policy in the 
      internal (0.185, the 95% lower bound for best AIVE policy vs. -0.406, the 95% 
      upper bound for clinicians' policy) and external validation (0.506, the 95% lower 
      bound for best AIVE policy vs. 0.154, the 95% upper bound for clinicians' 
      policy). Cardiorespiratory instability is minimized as the clinicians' 
      ventilation matches the model's ventilation. Regarding feature importance, airway 
      pressure is the most critical factor for ventilation control. In conclusion, the 
      AIVE model achieves higher estimated rewards with fewer complications than 
      clinicians' ventilation control policy during anesthesia emergence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of surgical pain is a common reason for opioid 
      prescriptions. Being able to predict which patients are at risk for opioid abuse, 
      dependence, and overdose (opioid-related adverse outcomes [OR-AE]) could help 
      physicians make safer prescription decisions. We aimed to develop a 
      machine-learning algorithm to predict the risk of OR-AE following surgery using 
      Medicaid data with external validation across states. METHODS: Five machine 
      learning models were developed and validated across seven US states (90-10 data 
      split). The model output was the risk of OR-AE 6-months following surgery. The 
      models were evaluated using standard metrics and area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for model comparison. We assessed 
      calibration for the top performing model and generated bootstrap estimations for 
      standard deviations. Decision curves were generated for the top-performing model 
      and logistic regression. RESULTS: We evaluated 96,974 surgical patients aged 15 
      and 64. During the 6-month period following surgery, 10,464 (10.8%) patients had 
      an OR-AE. Outcome rates were significantly higher for patients with depression 
      (17.5%), diabetes (13.1%) or obesity (11.1%). The random forest model achieved 
      the best predictive performance (AUC: 0.877; F1-score: 0.57; recall: 0.69; 
      precision:0.48). An opioid disorder diagnosis prior to surgery was the most 
      important feature for the model, which was well calibrated and had good 
      discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning models to predict risk of OR-AE 
      following surgery performed well in external validation. This work could be used 
      to assist pain management following surgery for Medicaid beneficiaries and 
      supports a precision medicine approach to opioid prescribing.

TI  - Appropriateness and Comprehensiveness of Using ChatGPT for Perioperative Patient 
      Education in Thoracic Surgery in Different Language Contexts: Survey Study.
PG  - e46900
LID - 10.2196/46900 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT, a dialogue-based artificial intelligence language model, has 
      shown promise in assisting clinical workflows and patient-clinician 
      communication. However, there is a lack of feasibility assessments regarding its 
      use for perioperative patient education in thoracic surgery. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to assess the appropriateness and comprehensiveness of using ChatGPT 
      for perioperative patient education in thoracic surgery in both English and 
      Chinese contexts. METHODS: This pilot study was conducted in February 2023. A 
      total of 37 questions focused on perioperative patient education in thoracic 
      surgery were created based on guidelines and clinical experience. Two sets of 
      inquiries were made to ChatGPT for each question, one in English and the other in 
      Chinese. The responses generated by ChatGPT were evaluated separately by 
      experienced thoracic surgical clinicians for appropriateness and 
      comprehensiveness based on a hypothetical draft response to a patient's question 
      on the electronic information platform. For a response to be qualified, it 
      required at least 80% of reviewers to deem it appropriate and 50% to deem it 
      comprehensive. Statistical analyses were performed using the unpaired chi-square 
      test or Fisher exact test, with a significance level set at P<.05. RESULTS: The 
      set of 37 commonly asked questions covered topics such as disease information, 
      diagnostic procedures, perioperative complications, treatment measures, disease 
      prevention, and perioperative care considerations. In both the English and 
      Chinese contexts, 34 (92%) out of 37 responses were qualified in terms of both 
      appropriateness and comprehensiveness. The remaining 3 (8%) responses were 
      unqualified in these 2 contexts. The unqualified responses primarily involved the 
      diagnosis of disease symptoms and surgical-related complications symptoms. The 
      reasons for determining the responses as unqualified were similar in both 
      contexts. There was no statistically significant difference (34/37, 92% vs 34/37, 
      92%; P=.99) in the qualification rate between the 2 language sets. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This pilot study demonstrates the potential feasibility of using ChatGPT for 
      perioperative patient education in thoracic surgery in both English and Chinese 
      contexts. ChatGPT is expected to enhance patient satisfaction, reduce anxiety, 
      and improve compliance during the perioperative period. In the future, there will 
      be remarkable potential application for using artificial intelligence, in 
      conjunction with human review, for patient education and health consultation 
      after patients have provided their informed consent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) based 
      real-time anatomy identification for ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve and plane 
      block in eight regions in this prospective observational study. METHODS: After 
      obtaining ethics committee approval and written informed consent from 40 healthy 
      volunteers (20 men and 20 women, between 18 and 72 years old), an ultrasound 
      device installed with AI software (Nerveblox, SmartAlfa, Turkey) were used to 
      scan regions of the cervical plexus, brachial plexus, pectoralis (PECS), rectus 
      sheet, femoralis, canalis adductorius, popliteal, and ESP by three anesthesiology 
      trainees. During scanning by a trainee, once software indicates 100 % scan 
      success of associated anatomic landmarks, both raw and labeled ultrasound images 
      were saved, assessed, and validated using a 6-point scale between 0 and 5 by two 
      expert validators. Evaluation scores of the validators for each block were 
      compared according to demographics (gender, age, and BMI) and block type exists. 
      RESULTS: The scores were not different except ESP, femoralis, and cervical plexus 
      regions between the experts. The mean scores of the experts for the PECS, 
      popliteal and rectus sheath were significant between males and females 
      (p < 0.05). In terms of BMI, significant differences in the scores were observed 
      only in the canalis adductorius, brachial plexus, and ESP regions (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound guided AI-based anatomy identification was performed in 
      commonly used eight block regions by the trainees where AI technology can 
      successfully interpret the anatomical structures in real-time sonography which 
      would be valuable in assisting anesthesiologists.

LID - 6965
AB  - Shared decision making is crucial in the pain domain. The subjective nature of 
      pain demands solutions that can facilitate pain assessment and management. The 
      aim of the current study is to review the current trends in both the commercial 
      and the research domains in order to reveal the key issues and guidelines that 
      could further help in the effective development of pain-focused apps. We searched 
      for scientific publications and commercial apps in 22 databases and the two major 
      app stores. Out of 3612 articles and 336 apps, 69 met the requirements for 
      inclusion following the PRISMA guidelines. An analysis of their features 
      (technological approach, design methodology, evaluation strategy, and others) 
      identified critical points that have to be taken into consideration in future 
      efforts. For example, commercial and research efforts target different types of 
      pain, while no participatory design is followed in the majority of the cases 
      examined. Moreover, the evaluation of the final apps remains a challenge that 
      hinders their success. The examined domain is expected to experience a 
      substantial increase. More research is needed towards the development of 
      non-intrusive wearables and sensors for pain detection and assessment, along with 
      artificial intelligence techniques and open data.

TI  - Children's Pain Identification Based on Skin Potential Signal.
LID - 10.3390/s23156815 [doi]
LID - 6815
AB  - Pain management is a crucial concern in medicine, particularly in the case of 
      children who may struggle to effectively communicate their pain. Despite the 
      longstanding reliance on various assessment scales by medical professionals, 
      these tools have shown limitations and subjectivity. In this paper, we present a 
      pain assessment scheme based on skin potential signals, aiming to convert 
      subjective pain into objective indicators for pain identification using machine 
      learning methods. We have designed and implemented a portable non-invasive 
      measurement device to measure skin potential signals and conducted experiments 
      involving 623 subjects. From the experimental data, we selected 358 valid 
      records, which were then divided into 218 silent samples and 262 pain samples. A 
      total of 38 features were extracted from each sample, with seven features 
      displaying superior performance in pain identification. Employing three 
      classification algorithms, we found that the random forest algorithm achieved the 
      highest accuracy, reaching 70.63%. While this identification rate shows promise 
      for clinical applications, it is important to note that our results differ from 
      state-of-the-art research, which achieved a recognition rate of 81.5%. This 
      discrepancy arises from the fact that our pain stimuli were induced by clinical 
      operations, making it challenging to precisely control the stimulus intensity 
      when compared to electrical or thermal stimuli. Despite this limitation, our pain 
      assessment scheme demonstrates significant potential in providing objective pain 
      identification in clinical settings. Further research and refinement of the 
      proposed approach may lead to even more accurate and reliable pain management 
      techniques in the future.

TI  - Urology: a trip into metaverse.
PG  - 2647-2657
LID - 10.1007/s00345-023-04560-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Metaverse is becoming an alternative world in which technology and 
      virtual experiences are mixed with real life, and it holds the promise of 
      changing our way of living. Healthcare is already changing thanks to Metaverse 
      and its numerous applications. In particular, Urology and urologic patients can 
      benefit in many ways from Metaverse. METHODS: A non-systematic literature review 
      identified recently published studies dealing with Metaverse. The database used 
      for this review was PubMed, and the identified studies served as the base for a 
      narrative analysis of the literature that explored the use of Metaverse in 
      Urology. RESULTS: Virtual consultations can enhance access to care and reduce 
      distance and costs, and pain management and rehabilitation can find an incredible 
      support in virtual reality, reducing anxiety and stress and improving adherence 
      to therapy. Metaverse has the biggest potential in urologic surgery, where it can 
      revolutionize both surgery planning, with 3D modeling and virtual surgeries, and 
      intraoperatively, with augmented reality and artificial intelligence. Med Schools 
      can implement Metaverse in anatomy and surgery lectures, providing an immersive 
      environment for learning, and residents can use this platform for learning in a 
      safe space at their own pace. However, there are also potential challenges and 
      ethical concerns associated with the use of the metaverse in healthcare. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides an overview of the concept of the metaverse, its 
      potential applications, challenges, and opportunities, and discusses the 
      implications of its development in Urology.

PG  - 653

LID - 653
AB  - Background: More than four million people die each year in the month following 
      surgery, and many more experience complications such as acute kidney injury. Some 
      of these outcomes may be prevented through early identification of at-risk 
      patients and through intraoperative risk mitigation. Telemedicine has 
      revolutionized the way at-risk patients are identified in critical care, but 
      intraoperative telemedicine services are not widely used in anesthesiology. 
      Clinicians in telemedicine settings may assist with risk stratification and 
      brainstorm risk mitigation strategies while clinicians in the operating room are 
      busy performing other patient care tasks. Machine learning tools may help 
      clinicians in telemedicine settings leverage the abundant electronic health data 
      available in the perioperative period. The primary hypothesis for this study is 
      that anesthesiology clinicians can predict postoperative complications more 
      accurately with machine learning assistance than without machine learning 
      assistance. Methods: This investigation is a sub-study nested within the 
      TECTONICS randomized clinical trial (NCT03923699). As part of TECTONICS, study 
      team members who are anesthesiology clinicians working in a telemedicine setting 
      are currently reviewing ongoing surgical cases and documenting how likely they 
      feel the patient is to experience 30-day in-hospital death or acute kidney 
      injury. For patients who are included in this sub-study, these case reviews will 
      be randomized to be performed with access to a display showing machine learning 
      predictions for the postoperative complications or without access to the display. 
      The accuracy of the predictions will be compared across these two groups. 
      Conclusion: Successful completion of this study will help define the role of 
      machine learning not only for intraoperative telemedicine, but for other risk 
      assessment tasks before, during, and after surgery. Registration: ORACLE is 
      registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05042804; registered September 13, 2021.

TI  - Predicting futility of upfront surgery in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma: Machine 
      learning analytics model to optimize treatment allocation.
PG  - 341-354
LID - 10.1097/HEP.0000000000000554 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While resection remains the only curative option for perihilar 
      cholangiocarcinoma, it is well known that such surgery is associated with a high 
      risk of morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, beyond facing life-threatening 
      complications, patients may also develop early disease recurrence, defining a 
      "futile" outcome in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma surgery. The aim of this study 
      is to predict the high-risk category (futile group) where surgical benefits are 
      reversed and alternative treatments may be considered. METHODS: The study cohort 
      included prospectively maintained data from 27 Western tertiary referral centers: 
      the population was divided into a development and a validation cohort. The 
      Framingham Heart Study methodology was used to develop a preoperative scoring 
      system predicting the "futile" outcome. RESULTS: A total of 2271 cases were 
      analyzed: among them, 309 were classified within the "futile group" (13.6%). 
      American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score ≥ 3 (OR 1.60; p = 0.005), 
      bilirubin at diagnosis ≥50 mmol/L (OR 1.50; p = 0.025), Ca 19-9 ≥ 100 U/mL (OR 
      1.73; p = 0.013), preoperative cholangitis (OR 1.75; p = 0.002), portal vein 
      involvement (OR 1.61; p = 0.020), tumor diameter ≥3 cm (OR 1.76; p < 0.001), and 
      left-sided resection (OR 2.00; p < 0.001) were identified as independent 
      predictors of futility. The point system developed, defined three (ie, low, 
      intermediate, and high) risk classes, which showed good accuracy (AUC 0.755) when 
      tested on the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility to accurately 
      estimate, through a point system, the risk of severe postoperative morbidity and 
      early recurrence, could be helpful in defining the best management strategy 
      (surgery vs. nonsurgical treatments) according to preoperative features.

PG  - 68-76
LID - 10.23736/S0375-9393.23.17464-5 [doi]
AB  - Innovation and new technologies have always impacted significantly the 
      anesthesiology practice all along the perioperative course, as it is recognized 
      as one of the most transformative medical specialties specifically regarding 
      patient's safety. Beside a number of major changes in procedures, equipment, 
      training, and organization that aggregated to establish a strong safety culture 
      with effective practices, anesthesiology is also a stakeholder in disruptive 
      innovation. The present review is not exhaustive and aims to provide an overview 
      on how innovation could change and improve anesthesiology practices through some 
      examples as telemedicine (TM), machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). 
      For example, postoperative complications can be accurately predicted by AI from 
      automated real-time electronic health record data, matching physicians' 
      predictive accuracy. Clinical workflow could be facilitated and accelerated with 
      mobile devices and applications, assuming that these tools should remain at the 
      service of patients and care providers. Care providers and patients connections 
      have improved, thanks to these digital and innovative transformations, without 
      replacing existing relationships between them. It also should give time back to 
      physicians and nurses to better spend it in the perioperative care, and to 
      provide "personalized" medicine keeping a high level of standard of care.

AB  - With an increase in geriatric population undergoing surgical procedures, research 
      focused on enhancing their perioperative outcomes is of paramount importance. 
      Currently, most of the evidence-based medicine protocols are driven by studies 
      concentrating on adults encompassing all adult age groups. Given the alterations 
      in physiology with aging, geriatric patients respond differently to anesthetics 
      and, therefore, require specific research initiatives to further expound on the 
      same. Large databases and the development of sophisticated analytic tools can 
      provide meaningful insights into this. Here, we discuss a few research 
      opportunities and challenges that data scientists face when focusing on geriatric 
      perioperative research.

TI  - Continuous Blood Pressure Monitoring in Patients Having Surgery: A Narrative 
      Review.
LID - 10.3390/medicina59071299 [doi]
LID - 1299
AB  - Hypotension can occur before, during, and after surgery and is associated with 
      postoperative complications. Anesthesiologists should thus avoid profound and 
      prolonged hypotension. A crucial part of avoiding hypotension is accurate and 
      tight blood pressure monitoring. In this narrative review, we briefly describe 
      methods for continuous blood pressure monitoring, discuss current evidence for 
      continuous blood pressure monitoring in patients having surgery to reduce 
      perioperative hypotension, and expand on future directions and innovations in 
      this field. In summary, continuous blood pressure monitoring with arterial 
      catheters or noninvasive sensors enables clinicians to detect and treat 
      hypotension immediately. Furthermore, advanced hemodynamic monitoring 
      technologies and artificial intelligence-in combination with continuous blood 
      pressure monitoring-may help clinicians identify underlying causes of hypotension 
      or even predict hypotension before it occurs.

TI  - Machine Learning Study of the Extended Drug-target Interaction Network informed 
      by Pain Related Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels.
LID - arXiv:2307.05794v1
AB  - Pain is a significant global health issue, and the current treatment options for 
      pain management have limitations in terms of effectiveness, side effects, and 
      potential for addiction. There is a pressing need for improved pain treatments 
      and the development of new drugs. Voltage-gated sodium channels, particularly 
      Nav1.3, Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9, play a crucial role in neuronal excitability 
      and are predominantly expressed in the peripheral nervous system. Targeting these 
      channels may provide a means to treat pain while minimizing central and cardiac 
      adverse effects. In this study, we construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
      networks based on pain-related sodium channels and develop a corresponding 
      drug-target interaction (DTI) network to identify potential lead compounds for 
      pain management. To ensure reliable machine learning predictions, we carefully 
      select 111 inhibitor datasets from a pool of over 1,000 targets in the PPI 
      network. We employ three distinct machine learning algorithms combined with 
      advanced natural language processing (NLP)-based embeddings, specifically 
      pre-trained transformer and autoencoder representations. Through a systematic 
      screening process, we evaluate the side effects and repurposing potential of over 
      150,000 drug candidates targeting Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 sodium channels. 
      Additionally, we assess the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
      excretion, and toxicity) properties of these candidates to identify leads with 
      near-optimal characteristics. Our strategy provides an innovative platform for 
      the pharmacological development of pain treatments, offering the potential for 
      improved efficacy and reduced side effects.

      days, developments in ultrasonography devices and probes, hardware, and software 
      technologies such as real-time needle tip tracking are increasing rapidly. 
      Artificial intelligence-powered ultrasonography is one of them. In this case 
      report, we aimed to present three cases where regional block was applied using 
      artificial intelligence-powered (Nerveblox) ultrasound. Infraclavicular nerve 
      block to two of our patients and pectoral nerve block to the third one were 
      applied successfully once at a time. None of the patients developed vascular 
      puncture or local anesthetic toxicity. The use of artificial intelligence support 
      in peripheral nerve blocks may reduce the number of attempts and duration of 
      interventions.

TI  - Using Machine Learning (ML) Models to Predict Risk of Venous Thromboembolism 
      (VTE) Following Spine Surgery.
PG  - E453-E456
LID - 10.1097/BSD.0000000000001498 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: Venous thromboembolism 
      (VTE) is a potentially high-risk complication for patients undergoing spine 
      surgery. Although guidelines for assessing VTE risk in this population have been 
      established, development of new techniques that target different aspects of the 
      medical history may prove to be of further utility. The goal of this study was to 
      develop a predictive machine learning (ML) model to identify nontraditional risk 
      factors for predicting VTE in spine surgery patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: 
      A cohort of 63 patients was identified who had undergone spine surgery at a 
      single center from 2015 to 2021. Thirty-one patients had a confirmed VTE, while 
      32 had no VTE. A total of 113 attributes were defined and collected via chart 
      review. Attribute categories included demographics, medications, labs, past 
      medical history, operative history, and VTE diagnosis. METHODS: The Waikato 
      Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software was used in creating and 
      evaluating the ML models. Six classifier models were tested with 10-fold 
      cross-validation and statistically evaluated using t tests. RESULTS: Comparing 
      the predictive ML models to the control model (ZeroR), all predictive models were 
      significantly better than the control model at predicting VTE risk, based on the 
      113 attributes ( P <0.001). The Random Forest model had the highest accuracy of 
      88.89% with a positive predictive value of 93.75%. The Simple Logistic algorithm 
      had an accuracy of 84.13% and defined risk attributes to include calcium and 
      phosphate laboratory values, history of cardiac comorbidity, history of previous 
      VTE, anesthesia time, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use, antibiotic use, 
      and antihistamine use. The J48 model had an accuracy of 80.95% and it defined 
      hemoglobin laboratory values, anesthesia time, beta-blocker use, dopamine agonist 
      use, history of cancer, and Medicare use as potential VTE risk factors. 
      CONCLUSION: Further development of these tools may provide high diagnostic value 
      and may guide chemoprophylaxis treatment in this setting of high-risk patients.

AB  - Cancer pain is a challenging clinical problem that is encountered in the 
      management of cancer pain. We aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of deep 
      learning models that predict the onset of cancer pain exacerbation in 
      hospitalized patients. We defined cancer pain exacerbation (CPE) as the pain with 
      a numerical rating scale (NRS) score of ≥ 4. We investigated the performance of 
      the deep learning models using the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) with 
      different input lengths and time binning. All the pain records were obtained from 
      the electronic medical records of the hematology-oncology wards in a Samsung 
      Medical Center between July 2016 and February 2020. The model was externally 
      validated using the holdout method with 20% of the datasets. The most common type 
      of cancer was lung cancer (n = 745, 21.7%), and the median CPE per day was 1.01. 
      The NRS pain records showed circadian patterns that correlated with NRS pain 
      patterns of the previous days. The correlation of the NRS scores showed a 
      positive association with the closeness of the NRS pattern of the day with 
      forecast date and size of time binning. The long short-term memory-based model 
      exhibited a good performance by demonstrating 9 times the best performance and 8 
      times the second-best performance among 21 different settings. The best 
      performance was achieved with 120 h input and 12 h bin lengths (MCC: 0.4927). Our 
      study demonstrated the possibility of predicting CPE using deep learning models, 
      thereby suggesting that preemptive cancer pain management using deep learning 
      could potentially improve patients' daily life.

TI  - Snakebite Advice and Counseling From Artificial Intelligence: An Acute Venomous 
      Snakebite Consultation With ChatGPT.
PG  - e40351
LID - 10.7759/cureus.40351 [doi]
LID - e40351
AB  - BACKGROUND: Snakebites, particularly from venomous species, present a significant 
      global public health challenge. Access to accurate and timely information 
      regarding snakebite prevention, recognition, and management is crucial for 
      minimizing morbidity and mortality. Artificial intelligence (AI) language models, 
      such as ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer), have the potential to 
      revolutionize the dissemination of medical information and improve patient 
      education and satisfaction. METHODS: This study aimed to explore the utility of 
      ChatGPT, an advanced language model, in simulating acute venomous snakebite 
      consultations. Nine hypothetical questions based on comprehensive snakebite 
      management guidelines were posed to ChatGPT, and the responses were evaluated by 
      clinical toxicologists and emergency medicine physicians. RESULTS: ChatGPT 
      provided accurate and informative responses related to the immediate management 
      of snakebites, the urgency of seeking medical attention, symptoms, and health 
      issues following venomous snakebites, the role of antivenom, misconceptions about 
      snakebites, recovery, pain management, and prevention strategies. The model 
      highlighted the importance of seeking professional medical care and adhering to 
      healthcare practitioners' advice. However, some limitations were identified, 
      including outdated knowledge, lack of personalization, and inability to consider 
      regional variations and individual characteristics. CONCLUSION: ChatGPT 
      demonstrated proficiency in generating intelligible and well-informed responses 
      related to venomous snakebites. It offers accessible and real-time advice, making 
      it a valuable resource for preliminary information, education, and triage support 
      in remote or underserved areas. While acknowledging its limitations, such as the 
      need for up-to-date information and personalized advice, ChatGPT can serve as a 
      supplementary source of information to complement professional medical 
      consultation and enhance patient education. Future research should focus on 
      addressing the identified limitations and establishing region-specific guidelines 
      for snakebite management.

TI  - Predicting Intraoperative Hypothermia Burden during Non-Cardiac Surgery: A 
      Retrospective Study Comparing Regression to Six Machine Learning Algorithms.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12134434 [doi]
LID - 4434
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia is a common complication that 
      affects patient comfort and morbidity. As the development of hypothermia is a 
      complex phenomenon, predicting it using machine learning (ML) algorithms may be 
      superior to logistic regression. METHODS: We performed a single-center 
      retrospective study and assembled a feature set comprised of 71 variables. The 
      primary outcome was hypothermia burden, defined as the area under the 
      intraoperative temperature curve below 37 °C over time. We built seven prediction 
      models (logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest 
      (RF), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), linear discriminant analysis 
      (LDA), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Gaussian naïve Bayes (GNB)) to predict 
      whether patients would not develop hypothermia or would develop mild, moderate, 
      or severe hypothermia. For each model, we assessed discrimination (F1 score, area 
      under the receiver operating curve, precision, recall) and calibration 
      (calibration-in-the-large, calibration intercept, calibration slope). RESULTS: We 
      included data from 87,116 anesthesia cases. Predicting the hypothermia burden 
      group using logistic regression yielded a weighted F1 score of 0.397. Ranked from 
      highest to lowest weighted F1 score, the ML algorithms performed as follows: 
      XGBoost (0.44), RF (0.418), LDA (0.406), LDA (0.4), KNN (0.362), and GNB (0.32). 
      CONCLUSIONS: ML is suitable for predicting intraoperative hypothermia and could 
      be applied in clinical practice.

TI  - An Automatically Adaptive Digital Health Intervention to Decrease Opioid-Related 
      Risk While Conserving Counselor Time: Quantitative Analysis of Treatment 
      Decisions Based on Artificial Intelligence and Patient-Reported Risk Measures.
PG  - e44165

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients prescribed opioid analgesic (OA) medications for pain 
      experience serious side effects, including dependence, sedation, and overdose. As 
      most patients are at low risk for OA-related harms, risk reduction interventions 
      requiring multiple counseling sessions are impractical on a large scale. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates whether an intervention based on reinforcement 
      learning (RL), a field of artificial intelligence, learned through experience to 
      personalize interactions with patients with pain discharged from the emergency 
      department (ED) and decreased self-reported OA misuse behaviors while conserving 
      counselors' time. METHODS: We used data representing 2439 weekly interactions 
      between a digital health intervention ("Prescription Opioid Wellness and 
      Engagement Research in the ED" [PowerED]) and 228 patients with pain discharged 
      from 2 EDs who reported recent opioid misuse. During each patient's 12 weeks of 
      intervention, PowerED used RL to select from 3 treatment options: a brief 
      motivational message delivered via an interactive voice response (IVR) call, a 
      longer motivational IVR call, or a live call from a counselor. The algorithm 
      selected session types for each patient each week, with the goal of minimizing OA 
      risk, defined in terms of a dynamic score reflecting patient reports during IVR 
      monitoring calls. When a live counseling call was predicted to have a similar 
      impact on future risk as an IVR message, the algorithm favored IVR to conserve 
      counselor time. We used logit models to estimate changes in the relative 
      frequency of each session type as PowerED gained experience. Poisson regression 
      was used to examine the changes in self-reported OA risk scores over calendar 
      time, controlling for the ordinal session number (1st to 12th). RESULTS: 
      Participants on average were 40 (SD 12.7) years of age; 66.7% (152/228) were 
      women and 51.3% (117/228) were unemployed. Most participants (175/228, 76.8%) 
      reported chronic pain, and 46.2% (104/225) had moderate to severe depressive 
      symptoms. As PowerED gained experience through interactions over a period of 142 
      weeks, it delivered fewer live counseling sessions than brief IVR sessions 
      (P=.006) and extended IVR sessions (P<.001). Live counseling sessions were 
      selected 33.5% of the time in the first 5 weeks of interactions (95% CI 
      27.4%-39.7%) but only for 16.4% of sessions (95% CI 12.7%-20%) after 125 weeks. 
      Controlling for each patient's changes during the course of treatment, this 
      adaptation of treatment-type allocation led to progressively greater improvements 
      in self-reported OA risk scores (P<.001) over calendar time, as measured by the 
      number of weeks since enrollment began. Improvement in risk behaviors over time 
      was especially pronounced among patients with the highest risk at baseline 
      (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: The RL-supported program learned which treatment modalities 
      worked best to improve self-reported OA risk behaviors while conserving 
      counselors' time. RL-supported interventions represent a scalable solution for 
      patients with pain receiving OA prescriptions. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - [Application possibilities of digital tools in postoperative pain therapy].
PG  - 234-241
LID - 10.1007/s00482-023-00732-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, digital tools, such as smartphone-based applications and 
      the use of artificial intelligence have increasingly found their way into pain 
      medicine. This could enable new treatment approaches in postoperative pain 
      management. Therefore, this article provides an overview of various digital tools 
      and their potential application options in postoperative pain management. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: An orienting literature search was carried out in the 
      MEDLINE and Web of Science databases, and a targeted selection of essential key 
      publications was made in order to provide a structured presentation of different 
      current possible applications and a discussion based on the most recent 
      knowledge. RESULTS: Today, possible applications of digital tools, even if they 
      mostly have only a model character, include pain documentation and assessment, 
      patient self-management and education, pain prediction, decision support for 
      medical staff, and supportive pain therapy, for example in the form of virtual 
      reality and videos. These tools offer advantages such as individualized treatment 
      concepts, addressing specific patient groups, reduction of pain and analgesics, 
      and the potential for early warning or detection of postoperative pain. 
      Furthermore, the challenges of the technical implementation and appropriate user 
      training are highlighted. CONCLUSION: The use of digital tools, although so far 
      integrated in clinical routine in a relatively selective and exemplary manner, 
      promises to be an innovative approach for personalized postoperative pain therapy 
      in the future. Future studies and projects should help to integrate the promising 
      research approaches into everyday clinical practice.

TI  - Machine Learning Prediction Models to Reduce Length of Stay at Ambulatory Surgery 
      Centers Through Case Resequencing.
PG  - 71

AB  - The post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay is an important perioperative 
      efficiency metric. The aim of this study was to develop machine learning models 
      to predict ambulatory surgery patients at risk for prolonged PACU length of stay 
      - using only pre-operatively identified factors - and then to simulate the 
      effectiveness in reducing the need for after-hours PACU staffing. Several machine 
      learning classifier models were built to predict prolonged PACU length of stay 
      (defined as PACU stay ≥ 3 hours) on a training set. A case resequencing exercise 
      was then performed on the test set, in which historic cases were re-sequenced 
      based on the predicted risk for prolonged PACU length of stay. The frequency of 
      patients remaining in the PACU after-hours (≥ 7:00 pm) were compared between the 
      simulated operating days versus actual operating room days. There were 10,928 
      ambulatory surgical patients included in the analysis, of which 580 (5.31%) had a 
      PACU length of stay ≥ 3 hours. XGBoost with SMOTE performed the best (AUC = 
      0.712). The case resequencing exercise utilizing the XGBoost model resulted in an 
      over three-fold improvement in the number of days in which patients would be in 
      the PACU past 7pm as compared with historic performance (41% versus 12%, 
      P<0.0001). Predictive models using preoperative patient characteristics may allow 
      for optimized case sequencing, which may mitigate the effects of prolonged PACU 
      lengths of stay on after-hours staffing utilization.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of chronic pain, its physical and 
      psychosocial impact on daily life, and the various therapies adopted to alleviate 
      pain. METHODS: The cross-sectional population-based telephonic survey was 
      conducted from May to July 2021 at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, 
      Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised patients of either gender aged at least 18 years 
      suffering from chronic pain who visited the institutional laboratory collection 
      centres. In the first phase, people who were suffering from chronic pain were 
      screened, while in the second phase, data was collected using a detailed 
      questionnaire exploring pain history, treatment and its effects. The data was 
      compiled and analysed using Antlere's AI based software. RESULTS: Of the 4,801 
      patients contacted, 757(15.75%) were suffering from chronic pain. A total of 
      201(20%) subjects reported that their pain score was 5/10 on the numerical rating 
      scale. Back pain was the major complaint (183, 18%) among the subjects. Of the 
      total, 335(44.25%) were having active treatment, and 226 (67%) of them said the 
      medication was effective. Overall, 706 (93%) patients had never visited a pain 
      management specialist. Furthermore, 252 (33%) participants were diagnosed with 
      depression, and 106 (14%) patients said that they were suicidal at some point in 
      life. CONCLUSIONS: .The survey observed that a high percentage of unawareness 
      existed on pain management among the Pakistani citizens.

TI  - Examining Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities in the Treatment of Pain and 
      Injury Emergencies.
PG  - 111-118
LID - 10.36518/2689-0216.1425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial, ethnic, and gender disparities in effective pain management 
      have been well-documented across healthcare settings. However, discrepancies in 
      the treatment of patients in prehospital pain management settings have not been 
      well researched. The objective of this study was to determine whether Wyoming 
      emergency medical service (EMS) providers' use of opioids to treat prehospital 
      pain or injury varies by patient race/ethnicity or gender. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study of EMS records examined 27 448 patient care reports (PCRs) 
      generated during emergency medical responses to pain/injury emergencies in the 
      state of Wyoming between January 2016 and March 2019. We included PCRs in the 
      sample when 1) the primary impression was pain or injury, 2) the type of service 
      was a 911 response, 3) the patient received treatment from and was transported by 
      the EMS unit completing the PCR, and 4) the responding unit included one or more 
      providers authorized to administer opioids. RESULTS: The analysis identified a 
      disparity in opioid administration by EMS providers during emergency transport (N 
      = 27 448). Logistic regression reveals that EMS providers administered opioids to 
      American Indian/Alaska Native patients (AI/AN) [n = 1610; 5.9%; P < .001; OR = 
      0.44] and those of Hispanic ethnicity (n = 1351; 4.9%; P = .001; OR = 0.74) at 
      statistically significant lower rates (n = 14 769; 53.8%; P = .004; OR = 0.90) 
      than they administer opioids to White patients. The analysis found EMS providers 
      administer opioids to females at significantly lower rates (P = .004) compared to 
      males. CONCLUSION: Wyoming EMS providers administer opioids to White and male 
      patients more often than non-White and female patients. Our results do not show a 
      significant difference in the administration of opioids between White and Black 
      patients. However, the data indicate a statistically significant difference 
      between Hispanic, AI/AN, and White patients as well as between male and female 
      patients.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Machine Learning Model to Identify Patients 
      Before Surgery at High Risk for Postoperative Adverse Events.
PG  - e2322285
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.22285 [doi]
LID - e2322285
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Identifying patients at high risk of adverse outcomes prior to 
      surgery may allow for interventions associated with improved postoperative 
      outcomes; however, few tools exist for automated prediction. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the accuracy of an automated machine-learning model in the 
      identification of patients at high risk of adverse outcomes from surgery using 
      only data in the electronic health record. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This prognostic study was conducted among 1 477 561 patients undergoing surgery 
      at 20 community and tertiary care hospitals in the University of Pittsburgh 
      Medical Center (UPMC) health network. The study included 3 phases: (1) building 
      and validating a model on a retrospective population, (2) testing model accuracy 
      on a retrospective population, and (3) validating the model prospectively in 
      clinical care. A gradient-boosted decision tree machine learning method was used 
      for developing a preoperative surgical risk prediction tool. The Shapley additive 
      explanations method was used for model interpretability and further validation. 
      Accuracy was compared between the UPMC model and National Surgical Quality 
      Improvement Program (NSQIP) surgical risk calculator for predicting mortality. 
      Data were analyzed from September through December 2021. EXPOSURE: Undergoing any 
      type of surgical procedure. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Postoperative mortality 
      and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) at 30 days were 
      evaluated. RESULTS: Among 1 477 561 patients included in model development 
      (806 148 females [54.5%; mean [SD] age, 56.8 [17.9] years), 1 016 966 patient 
      encounters were used for training and 254 242 separate encounters were used for 
      testing the model. After deployment in clinical use, another 206 353 patients 
      were prospectively evaluated; an additional 902 patients were selected for 
      comparing the accuracy of the UPMC model and NSQIP tool for predicting mortality. 
      The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for mortality 
      was 0.972 (95% CI, 0.971-0.973) for the training set and 0.946 (95% CI, 
      0.943-0.948) for the test set. The AUROC for MACCE and mortality was 0.923 (95% 
      CI, 0.922-0.924) on the training and 0.899 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) on the test set. 
      In prospective evaluation, the AUROC for mortality was 0.956 (95% CI, 
      0.953-0.959), sensitivity was 2148 of 2517 patients (85.3%), specificity was 
      186 286 of 203 836 patients (91.4%), and negative predictive value was 186 286 of 
      186 655 patients (99.8%). The model outperformed the NSQIP tool as measured by 
      AUROC (0.945 [95% CI, 0.914-0.977] vs 0.897 [95% CI, 0.854-0.941], for a 
      difference of 0.048), specificity (0.87 [95% CI, 0.83-0.89] vs 0.68 [95% CI, 
      0.65-0.69]), and accuracy (0.85 [95% CI, 0.82-0.87] vs 0.69 [95% CI, 0.66, 
      0.72]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that an automated machine 
      learning model was accurate in identifying patients undergoing surgery who were 
      at high risk of adverse outcomes using only preoperative variables within the 
      electronic health record, with superior performance compared with the NSQIP 
      calculator. These findings suggest that using this model to identify patients at 
      increased risk of adverse outcomes prior to surgery may allow for individualized 
      perioperative care, which may be associated with improved outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Lateralisation of some language pathways has been reported in the 
      literature using diffusion tractography, which is more feasible than functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in challenging patients. Our retrospective 
      study investigates whether a correlation exists between threshold-independent 
      fMRI language lateralisation and structural lateralisation using tractography in 
      healthy controls and brain tumour patients. METHODS: Fifteen healthy subjects and 
      61 patients underwent language fMRI and diffusion-weighted MRI. A regional fMRI 
      laterality index (LI) was calculated. Tracts dissected were the arcuate 
      fasciculus (long direct and short indirect tracts), uncinate fasciculus, inferior 
      longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and frontal aslant 
      tract. An asymmetry index (AI) for each tract was calculated using tract volume 
      analysed with single tensor (ST) and spherical deconvolution (SD) models, as well 
      as hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy (HMOA) for SD tracts. Linear 
      regression assessed the correlation between LI and AI. RESULTS: In all subjects, 
      there was no significant correlation between LI and AI for any of the dissected 
      tracts. Significant correlations were only found when handedness for controls and 
      tumour volume for patients were included as covariates. In handedness subgroups, 
      the average AI of some tracts showed the same laterality as LI, and some the 
      opposite. Discordant results were observed for ST- and SD-based AIs. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results do not support using tractography in the assessment of language 
      lateralisation. The discordant results between ST and SD indicate that either the 
      structural lateralisation of dissected tracts is less robust than functional 
      lateralisation, or tractography is not sensitive methodology. Other diffusion 
      analysis approaches should be developed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Although 
      diffusion tractography may be more feasible than fMRI in challenging tumour 
      patients and where sedation or anaesthesia is required, our results do not 
      currently recommend replacing fMRI with tractography using volume or HMOA in the 
      assessment of language lateralisation. KEY POINTS: • No correlation found between 
      fMRI and tractography in language lateralisation. • Discordance between asymmetry 
      indices of different tractography models and metrics. • Tractography not 
      currently recommended in language lateralisation assessment.

TI  - Opioid-related harms and care impacts of conventional and AI-based prescription 
      management strategies: insights from leveraging agent-based modeling and machine 
      learning.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Like its counterpart to the south, Canada ranks among the top five 
      countries with the highest rates of opioid prescriptions. With many suffering 
      from opioid use disorder first having encountered opioids via prescription 
      routes, practitioners and health systems have an enduring need to identify and 
      effectively respond to the problematic use of opioid prescription. There are 
      strong challenges to successfully addressing this need: importantly, the patterns 
      of prescription fulfillment that signal opioid abuse can be subtle and difficult 
      to recognize, and overzealous enforcement can deprive those with legitimate pain 
      management needs the appropriate care. Moreover, injudicious responses risk 
      shifting those suffering from early-stage abuse of prescribed opioids to 
      illicitly sourced street alternatives, whose varying dosage, availability, and 
      the risk of adulteration can pose grave health risks. METHODS: This study employs 
      a dynamic modeling and simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of prescription 
      regimes employing machine learning monitoring programs to identify the patients 
      who are at risk of opioid abuse while being treated with prescribed opioids. To 
      this end, an agent-based model was developed and implemented to examine the 
      effect of reduced prescribing and prescription drug monitoring programs on 
      overdose and escalation to street opioids among patients, and on the legitimacy 
      of fulfillments of opioid prescriptions over a 5-year time horizon. A study 
      released by the Canadian Institute for Health Information was used to estimate 
      the parameter values and assist in the validation of the existing agent-based 
      model. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The model estimates that lowering the prescription 
      doses exerted the most favorable impact on the outcomes of interest over 5 years 
      with a minimum burden on patients with a legitimate need for pharmaceutical 
      opioids. The accurate conclusion about the impact of public health interventions 
      requires a comprehensive set of outcomes to test their multi-dimensional effects, 
      as utilized in this research. Finally, combining machine learning and agent-based 
      modeling can provide significant advantages, particularly when using the latter 
      to gain insights into the long-term effects and dynamic circumstances of the 
      former.

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the relationship between eccentric downward eye 
      movement/eccentric downward eye-positioning (EDEM/EDEP) encountered in patients 
      undergoing ophthalmic surgeries and its return to a centralized position under 
      general anesthesia (GA) with the depth of anesthesia (DOA). METHODS: Patients 
      undergoing ophthalmic surgeries (6 months-12 years) under sevoflurane anesthesia 
      without non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (NDMR) who witnessed a sudden tonic 
      EDEM/EDEP were both retrospectively (R-group) and prospectively (P-group) 
      enrolled (ambispective study). R-group included data-points after induction (AI) 
      till the time surgery lasted while P-group compiled data both during induction 
      (DI) and AI. DOA in terms of MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) at the time of 
      EDEM/EDEP and centralization of eyeball and their timings were noted and compared 
      for both AI and DI data-points. Also, vertical eccentric eye positions were 
      scored and correlated with MAC. RESULTS: AI data included 22 (14R+8P) events and 
      their mean MAC of EDEM/EDEP and centralization were 1.60 ± 0.25 and 1.18 ± 0.17 
      respectively (p = 0.000). DI data included 62 (P) cases and its mean MAC of 
      EDEM/EDEP and centralization was 2.19 ± 0.43 and 1.39 ± 0.26 respectively (p = 
      0.000). Median (IQR) eye positions during down-positioning in 84 events was -3 
      (-3.9 to -2.5). It was preceded by an eccentric upward drift of eyes in 10/22 
      (6R+4P) AI cases. A strong negative correlation was seen between DOA and 
      eccentric eye positions (r = -0.77, p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Tonic down-rolling 
      of eyes is not uncommon in children seen without NDMR with higher depths of 
      sevoflurane anesthesia compared to point of centralization and fluctuations in 
      DOA should be avoided to circumvent inadvertent complications during ocular 
      surgery.

TI  - Utilizing an artificial intelligence framework (conditional generative 
      adversarial network) to enhance telemedicine strategies for cancer pain 
      management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has 
      significant potential to revolutionize the delivery of medical services, 
      particularly in the field of telemedicine. In this article, we investigate the 
      capabilities of a specific deep learning model, a generative adversarial network 
      (GAN), and explore its potential for enhancing the telemedicine approach to 
      cancer pain management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We implemented a structured 
      dataset comprising demographic and clinical variables from 226 patients and 489 
      telemedicine visits for cancer pain management. The deep learning model, 
      specifically a conditional GAN, was employed to generate synthetic samples that 
      closely resemble real individuals in terms of their characteristics. 
      Subsequently, four machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to assess the 
      variables associated with a higher number of remote visits. RESULTS: The 
      generated dataset exhibits a distribution comparable to the reference dataset for 
      all considered variables, including age, number of visits, tumor type, 
      performance status, characteristics of metastasis, opioid dosage, and type of 
      pain. Among the algorithms tested, random forest demonstrated the highest 
      performance in predicting a higher number of remote visits, achieving an accuracy 
      of 0.8 on the test data. The simulations based on ML indicated that individuals 
      who are younger than 45 years old, and those experiencing breakthrough cancer 
      pain, may require an increased number of telemedicine-based clinical evaluations. 
      CONCLUSION: As the advancement of healthcare processes relies on scientific 
      evidence, AI techniques such as GANs can play a vital role in bridging knowledge 
      gaps and accelerating the integration of telemedicine into clinical practice. 
      Nonetheless, it is crucial to carefully address the limitations of these 
      approaches.

TI  - Preference of musculoskeletal pain treatment in middle-aged and elderly chinese 
      people: a machine learning analysis of the China health and retirement 
      longitudinal study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal pain is a major cause of physical disability, 
      associated with huge socioeconomic burden. Patient preference for treatment is an 
      important factor contributing to the choice of treatment strategies. However, 
      effective measurements for evaluating the ongoing management of musculoskeletal 
      pain are lacking. To help improve clinical decision making, it's important to 
      estimate the current state of musculoskeletal pain management and analyze the 
      contribution of patient treatment preference. METHODS: A nationally 
      representative sample for the Chinese population was derived from the China 
      Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Information on the patients' 
      demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, other health-related behavior, 
      as well as history on musculoskeletal pain and treatment data were obtained. The 
      data was used to estimate the status of musculoskeletal pain treatment in China 
      in the year 2018. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were used to find 
      the effect factors of treatment preference. XGBoost model and Shapley Additive 
      exPlanations (SHAP) method were performed to analyze the contribution of each 
      variable to different treatment preferences. RESULTS: Among 18,814 respondents, 
      10,346 respondents suffered from musculoskeletal pain. Approximately 50% of 
      musculoskeletal pain patients preferred modern medicine, while about 20% chose 
      traditional Chinese medicine and another 15% chose acupuncture or massage 
      therapy. Differing preferences for musculoskeletal pain treatment was related to 
      the respondents' gender, age, place of residence, education level, insurance 
      status, and health-related behavior such as smoking and drinking. Compared with 
      upper or lower limb pain, neck pain and lower back pain were more likely to make 
      respondents choose massage therapy (P < 0.05). A greater number of pain sites was 
      associated with an increasing preference for respondents to seek medical care for 
      musculoskeletal pain (P < 0.05), while different pain sites did not affect 
      treatment preference. CONCLUSION: Factors including gender, age, socioeconomic 
      status, and health-related behavior may have potential effects on people' s 
      choice of treatment for musculoskeletal pain. The information derived from this 
      study may be useful for helping to inform clinical decisions for orthopedic 
      surgeons when devising treatment strategies for musculoskeletal pain.

TI  - Development of a Corpus Annotated With Mentions of Pain in Mental Health Records: 
      Natural Language Processing Approach.
PG  - e45849
LID - 10.2196/45849 [doi]
LID - e45849
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain is a widespread issue, with 20% of adults (1 in 5) experiencing 
      it globally. A strong association has been demonstrated between pain and mental 
      health conditions, and this association is known to exacerbate disability and 
      impairment. Pain is also known to be strongly related to emotions, which can lead 
      to damaging consequences. As pain is a common reason for people to access health 
      care facilities, electronic health records (EHRs) are a potential source of 
      information on this pain. Mental health EHRs could be particularly beneficial 
      since they can show the overlap of pain with mental health. Most mental health 
      EHRs contain the majority of their information within the free-text sections of 
      the records. However, it is challenging to extract information from free text. 
      Natural language processing (NLP) methods are therefore required to extract this 
      information from the text. OBJECTIVE: This research describes the development of 
      a corpus of manually labeled mentions of pain and pain-related entities from the 
      documents of a mental health EHR database, for use in the development and 
      evaluation of future NLP methods. METHODS: The EHR database used, Clinical Record 
      Interactive Search, consists of anonymized patient records from The South London 
      and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom. The 
      corpus was developed through a process of manual annotation where pain mentions 
      were marked as relevant (ie, referring to physical pain afflicting the patient), 
      negated (ie, indicating absence of pain), or not relevant (ie, referring to pain 
      affecting someone other than the patient, or metaphorical and hypothetical 
      mentions). Relevant mentions were also annotated with additional attributes such 
      as anatomical location affected by pain, pain character, and pain management 
      measures, if mentioned. RESULTS: A total of 5644 annotations were collected from 
      1985 documents (723 patients). Over 70% (n=4028) of the mentions found within the 
      documents were annotated as relevant, and about half of these mentions also 
      included the anatomical location affected by the pain. The most common pain 
      character was chronic pain, and the most commonly mentioned anatomical location 
      was the chest. Most annotations (n=1857, 33%) were from patients who had a 
      primary diagnosis of mood disorders (International Classification of 
      Diseases-10th edition, chapter F30-39). CONCLUSIONS: This research has helped 
      better understand how pain is mentioned within the context of mental health EHRs 
      and provided insight into the kind of information that is typically mentioned 
      around pain in such a data source. In future work, the extracted information will 
      be used to develop and evaluate a machine learning-based NLP application to 
      automatically extract relevant pain information from EHR databases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The application of data-driven methods is expected to play an 
      increasingly important role in healthcare. However, a lack of personnel with the 
      necessary skills to develop these models and interpret its output is preventing a 
      wider adoption of these methods. To address this gap, we introduce and describe 
      ORIENTATE, a software for automated application of machine learning 
      classification algorithms by clinical practitioners lacking specific technical 
      skills. ORIENTATE allows the selection of features and the target variable, then 
      automatically generates a number of classification models and cross-validates 
      them, finding the best model and evaluating it. It also implements a custom 
      feature selection algorithm for systematic searches of the best combination of 
      predictors for a given target variable. Finally, it outputs a comprehensive 
      report with graphs that facilitates the explanation of the classification model 
      results, using global interpretation methods, and an interface for the prediction 
      of new input samples. Feature relevance and interaction plots provided by 
      ORIENTATE allow to use it for statistical inference, which can replace and/or 
      complement classical statistical studies. RESULTS: Its application to a dataset 
      with healthy and special health care needs (SHCN) children, treated under deep 
      sedation, was discussed as case study. On the example dataset, despite its small 
      size, the feature selection algorithm found a set of features able to predict the 
      need for a second sedation with a f1 score of 0.83 and a ROC (AUC) of 0.92. Eight 
      predictive factors for both populations were found and ordered by the relevance 
      assigned to them by the model. A discussion of how to derive inferences from the 
      relevance and interaction plots and a comparison with a classical study is also 
      provided. CONCLUSIONS: ORIENTATE automatically finds suitable features and 
      generates accurate classifiers which can be used in preventive tasks. In 
      addition, researchers without specific skills on data methods can use it for the 
      application of machine learning classification and as a complement to classical 
      studies for inferential analysis of features. In the case study, a high 
      prediction accuracy for a second sedation in SHCN children was achieved. The 
      analysis of the relevance of the features showed that the number of teeth with 
      pulpar treatments at the first sedation is a predictive factor for a second 
      sedation.

TI  - User-Centered Design of a Machine Learning Dashboard for Prediction of 
      Postoperative Complications.
PG  - 804-813
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000006577 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machine learning models can help anesthesiology clinicians assess 
      patients and make clinical and operational decisions, but well-designed 
      human-computer interfaces are necessary for machine learning model predictions to 
      result in clinician actions that help patients. Therefore, the goal of this study 
      was to apply a user-centered design framework to create a user interface for 
      displaying machine learning model predictions of postoperative complications to 
      anesthesiology clinicians. METHODS: Twenty-five anesthesiology clinicians 
      (attending anesthesiologists, resident physicians, and certified registered nurse 
      anesthetists) participated in a 3-phase study that included (phase 1) 
      semistructured focus group interviews and a card sorting activity to characterize 
      user workflows and needs; (phase 2) simulated patient evaluation incorporating a 
      low-fidelity static prototype display interface followed by a semistructured 
      interview; and (phase 3) simulated patient evaluation with concurrent think-aloud 
      incorporating a high-fidelity prototype display interface in the electronic 
      health record. In each phase, data analysis included open coding of session 
      transcripts and thematic analysis. RESULTS: During the needs assessment phase 
      (phase 1), participants voiced that (a) identifying preventable risk related to 
      modifiable risk factors is more important than nonpreventable risk, (b) 
      comprehensive patient evaluation follows a systematic approach that relies 
      heavily on the electronic health record, and (c) an easy-to-use display interface 
      should have a simple layout that uses color and graphs to minimize time and 
      energy spent reading it. When performing simulations using the low-fidelity 
      prototype (phase 2), participants reported that (a) the machine learning 
      predictions helped them to evaluate patient risk, (b) additional information 
      about how to act on the risk estimate would be useful, and (c) correctable 
      problems related to textual content existed. When performing simulations using 
      the high-fidelity prototype (phase 3), usability problems predominantly related 
      to the presentation of information and functionality. Despite the usability 
      problems, participants rated the system highly on the System Usability Scale 
      (mean score, 82.5; standard deviation, 10.5). CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating user 
      needs and preferences into the design of a machine learning dashboard results in 
      a display interface that clinicians rate as highly usable. Because the system 
      demonstrates usability, evaluation of the effects of implementation on both 
      process and clinical outcomes is warranted.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Create personal statements using an artificial intelligence 
      program for anesthesiology residency applications that residency program 
      directors rate as acceptable. STUDY DESIGN: Generate two personal statements and 
      survey program directors. SETTING: Anesthesiology residency training programs. 
      INTERVENTIONS: We instructed ChatGPT, a new artificial-intelligence software 
      program, to generate two 400-word personal statements using the common applicant 
      experiences of involvement in athletics or gourmet cooking. METHODS: We sent the 
      generated personal statements to anesthesia program directors and asked them if 
      the statements were acceptable for application to their individual programs, to 
      rate them as poor, good, or excellent, and determine if they could detect 
      anything in the statements that indicated they were not written by an applicant. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Ninety-four program directors received and opened the survey, and 
      31 responded. Twenty-eight (90%) responding directors found the personal 
      statement with athletic experience acceptable, with 22 (74%) rating it as good or 
      excellent. Nineteen (61%) program directors did not detect anything in the 
      statement to distinguish it from an applicant-written composition. Twenty-nine 
      (97%) program directors found the personal statement with cooking experience 
      acceptable, with 19 (63%) finding it good or excellent. Twenty-four (80%) 
      directors did not detect anything in the statement to distinguish it from an 
      applicant-written composition. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT can create personal 
      statements for residency applications that program directors find acceptable and 
      difficult to differentiate from personally crafted statements. Applicants may 
      stop using expensive contractor application services and start using artificial

TI  - Defining Clinically Meaningful Subgroups for Risk Stratification in Patients 
      Undergoing Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Combined Unsupervised and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies developing predictive models from large datasets to 
      risk-stratify patients under going revision total hip arthroplasties (rTHAs) are 
      limited. We used machine learning (ML) to stratify patients undergoing rTHA into 
      risk-based subgroups. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 7,425 patients who 
      underwent rTHA from a national database. An unsupervised random forest algorithm 
      was used to partition patients into high-risk and low-risk strata based on 
      similarities in rates of mortality, reoperation, and 25 other postoperative 
      complications. A risk calculator was produced using a supervised ML algorithm to 
      identify high-risk patients based on preoperative parameters. RESULTS: There were 
      3,135 and 4,290 patients identified in the high-risk and low-risk subgroups, 
      respectively. Each group significantly differed by rate of 30-day mortalities, 
      unplanned reoperations/readmissions, routine discharges, and hospital lengths of 
      stay (P < .05). An Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm identified preoperative 
      platelets < 200, hematocrit > 35 or < 20, increasing age, albumin < 3, 
      international normalized ratio > 2, body mass index > 35, American Society of 
      Anesthesia class ≥ 3, blood urea nitrogen > 50 or < 30, creatinine > 1.5, 
      diagnosis of hypertension or coagulopathy, and revision for periprosthetic 
      fracture and infection as predictors of high risk. CONCLUSION: Clinically 
      meaningful risk strata in patients undergoing rTHA were identified using an ML 
      clustering approach. Preoperative labs, demographics, and surgical indications 
      have the greatest impact on differentiating high versus low risk. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: III.

TI  - Assessing the Precision of Surgery Duration Estimation: A Retrospective Study.
PG  - 1565-1576
LID - 10.2147/JMDH.S403756 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The operating room (OR) is considered the highest 
      source of cost and earnings. Therefore, measuring OR efficiency, which means how 
      time and resources are allocated precisely for their intended purposes in the 
      operating room is crucial. Both overestimation and underestimation negatively 
      impact OR efficiency Therefore, hospitals defined metrics to Measuring OR 
      Effeciency. Many studies have discussed OR efficiency and how surgery scheduling 
      accuracy plays a vital role in increasing OR efficiency. This study aims to 
      evaluate OR efficiency using surgery duration accuracy. METHODS: This 
      retrospective, quantitative study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City. 
      We extracted data on 97,397 surgeries from 2017 to 2021 from the OR database. The 
      accuracy of surgery duration was identified by calculating the duration of each 
      surgery in minutes by subtracting the time of leaving the OR from the time of 
      entering the OR. Based on the scheduled duration, the calculated durations were 
      categorized as either underestimation or overestimation. Descriptive and 
      bivariate analyses (Chi-square test) were performed using the Statistical Package 
      for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. RESULTS: Sixty percent out of the 97,397 
      surgeries performed were overestimated compared to the time scheduled by the 
      surgeons. Patient characteristics, surgical division, and anesthesia type showed 
      statistically significant differences (p <0.05) in their OR estimation. 
      CONCLUSION: Significant proportion of procedures have overestimated. This finding 
      provides insight into the need for improvement. RECOMMENDATIONS: It is 
      recommended to enhance the surgical scheduling method using machine learning (ML) 
      models to include patient characteristics, department, anesthesia type, and even 
      the performing surgeon increases the accuracy of duration estimation. Then, 
      evaluate the performance of an ML model in future studies.

      Intelligence: Observational Study.
PG  - e43896

LID - e43896
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications offer numerous 
      opportunities to improve health care. To be used in the intensive care unit, AI 
      must meet the needs of staff, and potential barriers must be addressed through 
      joint action by all stakeholders. It is thus critical to assess the needs and 
      concerns of anesthesiologists and intensive care physicians related to AI in 
      health care throughout Europe. OBJECTIVE: This Europe-wide, cross-sectional 
      observational study investigates how potential users of AI systems in 
      anesthesiology and intensive care assess the opportunities and risks of the new 
      technology. The web-based questionnaire was based on the established analytic 
      model of acceptance of innovations by Rogers to record 5 stages of innovation 
      acceptance. METHODS: The questionnaire was sent twice in 2 months (March 11, 
      2021, and November 5, 2021) through the European Society of Anaesthesiology and 
      Intensive Care (ESAIC) member email distribution list. A total of 9294 ESAIC 
      members were reached, of whom 728 filled out the questionnaire (response rate 
      728/9294, 8%). Due to missing data, 27 questionnaires were excluded. The analyses 
      were conducted with 701 participants. RESULTS: A total of 701 questionnaires 
      (female: n=299, 42%) were analyzed. Overall, 265 (37.8%) of the participants have 
      been in contact with AI and evaluated the benefits of this technology higher 
      (mean 3.22, SD 0.39) than participants who stated no previous contact (mean 3.01, 
      SD 0.48). Physicians see the most benefits of AI application in early warning 
      systems (335/701, 48% strongly agreed, and 358/701, 51% agreed). Major potential 
      disadvantages were technical problems (236/701, 34% strongly agreed, and 410/701, 
      58% agreed) and handling difficulties (126/701, 18% strongly agreed, and 462/701, 
      66% agreed), both of which could be addressed by Europe-wide digitalization and 
      education. In addition, the lack of a secure legal basis for the research and use 
      of medical AI in the European Union leads doctors to expect problems with legal 
      liability (186/701, 27% strongly agreed, and 374/701, 53% agreed) and data 
      protection (148/701, 21% strongly agreed, and 343/701, 49% agreed). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Anesthesiologists and intensive care personnel are open to AI applications in 
      their professional field and expect numerous benefits for staff and patients. 
      Regional differences in the digitalization of the private sector are not 
      reflected in the acceptance of AI among health care professionals. Physicians 
      anticipate technical difficulties and lack a stable legal basis for the use of 
      AI. Training for medical staff could increase the benefits of AI in professional 
      medicine. Therefore, we suggest that the development and implementation of AI in 
      health care require a solid technical, legal, and ethical basis, as well as 
      adequate education and training of users.

TI  - Predicting favorable response to intravenous morphine in pediatric critically ill 
      cardiac patients.
PG  - 579-587
LID - 10.1002/phar.2835 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Analgesia and sedation are integral to the care of critically ill 
      children. However, the choice and dose of the analgesic or sedative drug is often 
      empiric, and models predicting favorable responses are lacking. We aimed to 
      compute models to predict a patient's response to intravenous morphine. METHODS: 
      We retrospectively analyzed data from consecutive patients admitted to the 
      Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (January 2011-January 2020) who received at least one 
      intravenous bolus of morphine. The primary outcome was a decrease in the State 
      Behavioral Scale (SBS) ≥1 point; the secondary outcome was a decrease in the 
      heart rate Z-score (zHR) at 30 min. Effective doses were modeled using logistic 
      regression, Lasso regression, and random forest modeling. RESULTS: A total of 
      117,495 administrations of intravenous morphine among 8140 patients (median age 
      0.6 years [interquartile range [IQR] 0.19, 3.3]) were included. The median 
      morphine dose was 0.051 mg/kg (IQR 0.048, 0.099) and the median 30-day cumulative 
      dose was 2.2 mg/kg (IQR 0.4, 15.3). SBS decreased following 30% of doses, did not 
      change following 45%, and increased following 25%. The zHR significantly 
      decreased after morphine administration (median delta-zHR -0.34 [IQR-1.03, 0.00], 
      p < 0.001). The following factors were associated with favorable response to 
      morphine: A concomitant infusion of propofol, higher prior 30-day cumulative 
      dose, being invasively ventilated and/or on vasopressors. Higher morphine dose, 
      higher zHR pre-morphine, an additional analgosedation bolus ±30 min around the 
      index bolus, a concomitant ketamine or dexmedetomidine infusion, and showing 
      signs of withdrawal syndrome were associated with unfavorable response. Logistic 
      regression (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC] 
      0.900) and machine learning models (AUC 0.906) performed comparably, with a 
      sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 71%, and negative predictive value of 97%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Statistical models identify 95% of effective intravenous morphine 
      doses in pediatric critically ill cardiac patients, while incorrectly suggesting 
      an effective dose in 29% of cases. This work represents an important step toward 
      computer-aided, personalized clinical decision support tool for sedation and 
      analgesia in ICU patients.

TI  - Addition of dexamethasone to prolong peripheral nerve blocks: a ChatGPT-created 
      narrative review.

AB  - Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence 
      chatbot, produces detailed responses and human-like coherent answers, and has 
      been used in the clinical and academic medicine. To evaluate its accuracy in 
      regional anesthesia topics, we produced a ChatGPT review on the addition of 
      dexamethasone to prolong peripheral nerve blocks. A group of experts in regional 
      anesthesia and pain medicine were invited to help shape the topic to be studied, 
      refine the questions entered in to the ChatGPT program, vet the manuscript for 
      accuracy, and create a commentary on the article. Although ChatGPT produced an 
      adequate summary of the topic for a general medical or lay audience, the review 
      that were created appeared to be inadequate for a subspecialty audience as the 
      expert authors. Major concerns raised by the authors included the poor search 
      methodology, poor organization/lack of flow, inaccuracies/omissions of text or 
      references, and lack of novelty. At this time, we do not believe ChatGPT is able 
      to replace human experts and is extremely limited in providing original, creative 
      solutions/ideas and interpreting data for a subspecialty medical review article.

TI  - Clinical Knowledge and Reasoning Abilities of AI Large Language Models in 
      Anesthesiology: A Comparative Study on the ABA Exam.
LID - 2023.05.10.23289805 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.05.10.23289805 [doi]
AB  - Over the past decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has expanded significantly 
      with increased adoption across various industries, including medicine. Recently, 
      AI's large language models such as GPT-3, Bard, and GPT-4 have demonstrated 
      remarkable language capabilities. While previous studies have explored their 
      potential in general medical knowledge tasks, here we assess their clinical 
      knowledge and reasoning abilities in a specialized medical context. We study and 
      compare their performances on both the written and oral portions of the 
      comprehensive and challenging American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) exam, which 
      evaluates candidates' knowledge and competence in anesthesia practice. In 
      addition, we invited two board examiners to evaluate AI's answers without 
      disclosing to them the origin of those responses. Our results reveal that only 
      GPT-4 successfully passed the written exam, achieving an accuracy of 78% on the 
      basic section and 80% on the advanced section. In comparison, the less recent or 
      smaller GPT-3 and Bard models scored 58% and 47% on the basic exam, and 50% and 
      46% on the advanced exam, respectively. Consequently, only GPT-4 was evaluated in 
      the oral exam, with examiners concluding that it had a high likelihood of passing 
      the actual ABA exam. Additionally, we observe that these models exhibit varying 
      degrees of proficiency across distinct topics, which could serve as an indicator 
      of the relative quality of information contained in the corresponding training 
      datasets. This may also act as a predictor for determining which anesthesiology 
      subspecialty is most likely to witness the earliest integration with AI.

TI  - Pain Management in the Most Vulnerable Intellectual Disability: A Review.
PG  - 939-961
LID - 10.1007/s40122-023-00526-w [doi]
AB  - This review is made up of two parts; the first part discussing intellectual 
      disability (ID) in general, while the second part covers the pain associated with 
      intellectual disability and the challenges and practical tips for the management 
      of pain associated with (ID). Intellectual disability is characterized by 
      deficits in general mental abilities, such as reasoning, problem solving, 
      planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from 
      experience. ID is a disorder with no definite cause but has multiple risk 
      factors, including genetic, medical, and acquired. Vulnerable populations such as 
      individuals with intellectual disability may experience more pain than the 
      general population due to additional comorbidities and secondary conditions, or 
      at least the same frequency of pain as in the general population. Pain in 
      patients with ID remains largely unrecognized and untreated due to barriers to 
      verbal and non-verbal communication. It is important to identify patients at risk 
      to promptly prevent or minimize those risk factors. As pain is multifactorial, 
      thus, a multimodal approach using both pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological 
      management is often the most beneficial. Parents and caregivers should be 
      oriented to this disorder, given adequate training and education, and be actively 
      involved with the treatment program. Significant work to create new pain 
      assessment tools to improve pain practices for individuals with ID has taken 
      place, including neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. Recent advances 
      in technology-based interventions such as virtual reality and artificial 
      intelligence are rapidly growing to help give patients with ID promising results 
      to develop pain coping skills with effective reduction of pain and anxiety. 
      Therefore, this narrative review highlights the different aspects regarding the 
      current status of the pain associated with intellectual disability, with more 
      emphasis on the recent pieces of evidence for the assessment and management of 
      pain among populations with intellectual disability.

TI  - Neurocognitive predictors of adherence to an online pain self-management program 
      adjunct to long-term opioid therapy.
PG  - 242-254
LID - 10.1080/13803395.2023.2221396 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: While pain self-management programs can significantly improve 
      patient outcomes, poor adherence is common and the need for research on 
      predictors of adherence has been noted. A potential, but commonly overlooked, 
      predictor is cognitive function. Our aim, then, was to examine the relative 
      influence of various cognitive functional domains on engagement with an online 
      pain self-management program. METHOD: A secondary analysis of a randomized 
      controlled trial testing the impact of E-health (a 4-month subscription to the 
      online Goalistics Chronic Pain Management Program) plus treatment as usual, 
      relative to treatment as usual alone, on pain and opioid dose outcomes in adults 
      receiving long-term opioid therapy of morphine equivalence dose ≥20 mg; 165 
      E-health participants who completed an on-line neurocognitive battery were 
      included in this sub-analysis. A variety of demographic, clinical, and symptom 
      rating scales were also examined. We hypothesized that better processing speed 
      and executive functions at baseline would predict engagement with the 4-month 
      E-health subscription. RESULTS: Ten functional cognitive domains were identified 
      using exploratory factor analysis and the resultant factor scores applied for 
      hypothesis testing. The strongest predictors of E-health engagement were 
      selective attention, and response inhibition and speed domains. An explainable 
      machine learning algorithm improved classification accuracy, sensitivity, and 
      specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that cognition, especially 
      selective attention, inhibitory control, and processing speed, is predictive of 
      online chronic pain self-management program engagement. Future research to 
      replicate and extend these findings seems warranted. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV

AB  - Medical ultrasound technology has garnered significant attention in recent years, 
      with Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) and carpal tunnel diagnosis 
      (CTS) being two notable examples. Instance segmentation, based on deep learning 
      approaches, is a promising choice to support the analysis of ultrasound data. 
      However, many instance segmentation models cannot achieve the requirement of 
      ultrasound technology e.g. real-time. Moreover, fully supervised instance 
      segmentation models require large numbers of images and corresponding mask 
      annotations for training, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive in the 
      case of medical ultrasound data. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised 
      framework, CoarseInst, to achieve real-time instance segmentation of ultrasound 
      images with only box annotations. CoarseInst not only improves the network 
      structure, but also proposes a two-stage "coarse-to-fine" training strategy. 
      Specifically, median nerves are used as the target application for UGRA and CTS. 
      CoarseInst consists of two stages, with pseudo mask labels generated in the 
      coarse mask generation stage for self-training. An object enhancement block is 
      incorporated to mitigate the performance loss caused by parameter reduction in 
      this stage. Additionally, we introduce a pair of loss functions, the 
      amplification loss, and the deflation loss, that work together to generate the 
      masks. A center area mask searching algorithm is also proposed to generate labels 
      for the deflation loss. In the self-training stage, a novel self-feature 
      similarity loss is designed to generate more precise masks. Experimental results 
      on a practical ultrasound dataset demonstrate that CoarseInst could achieve 
      better performance than some state-of-the-art fully supervised works.

AB  - Perioperative medication has made significant contributions to enhancing patient 
      safety. Nevertheless, administering medication during this period still poses 
      considerable safety concerns, with many errors being detected only after causing 
      significant physiological disturbances. The intricacy of medication 
      administration in the perioperative setting poses specific challenges to patient 
      safety. To address these challenges, implementing potential strategies and 
      interventions is critical. One such strategy is raising awareness and revising 
      educational curricula regarding drug safety in the operating room. Another 
      crucial strategy is recognizing the importance of redundancy and multiple checks 
      in the operating room as a hallmark of medication safety, which is not a common 
      practice. Digital health technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) also offer 
      the potential to improve perioperative medication safety. Computerized physician 
      order entry systems, electronic medication administration records, and barcode 
      medication administration systems have been proven to reduce medication errors 
      and improve patient safety. By implementing these strategies and interventions, 
      health care professionals can enhance the safety of perioperative medication 
      administration and improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Prediction of Non-Home Discharge Following Total Hip Arthroplasty in Geriatric 
      Patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The majority of total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients are 
      discharged home postoperatively, however, many still require continued medical 
      care. We aimed to identify important characteristics that predict nonhome 
      discharge in geriatric patients undergoing THA using machine learning. We 
      hypothesize that our analyses will identify variables associated with decreased 
      functional status and overall health to be predictive of non-home discharge. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Elective, unilateral, THA patients above 65 years of age 
      were isolated in the NSQIP database from 2018-2020. Demographic, pre-operative, 
      and intraoperative variables were analyzed. After splitting the data into 
      training (75%) and validation (25%) data sets, various machine learning models 
      were used to predict non-home discharge. The model with the best area under the 
      curve (AUC) was further assessed to identify the most important variables. 
      RESULTS: In total, 19,840 geriatric patients undergoing THA were included in the 
      final analyses, of which 5194 (26.2%) were discharged to a non-home setting. The 
      RF model performed the best and identified age above 78 years (OR: 1.08 [1.07, 
      1.09], P < .0001), as the most important variable when predicting non-home 
      discharge in geriatric patients with THA, followed by severe American Society of 
      Anesthesiologists grade (OR: 1.94 [1.80, 2.10], P < .0001), operation time (OR: 
      1.01 [1.00, 1.02], P < .0001), anemia (OR: 2.20 [1.87, 2.58], P < .0001), and 
      general anesthesia (OR: 1.64 [1.52, 1.79], P < .0001). Each of these variables 
      was also significant in MLR analysis. The RF model displayed good discrimination 
      with AUC = .831. DISCUSSION: The RF model revealed clinically important variables 
      for assessing discharge disposition in geriatric patients undergoing THA, with 
      the five most important factors being older age, severe ASA grade, longer 
      operation time, anemia, and general anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: With the rising 
      emphasis on patient-centered care, incorporating models such as these may allow 
      for preoperative risk factor mitigation and reductions in healthcare expenditure.

AB  - Personalized care models are dominating modern medicine. These models are rooted 
      in teaching future physicians the skill set to keep up with innovation. In 
      orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery, education is increasingly influenced by 
      augmented reality, simulation, navigation, robotics, and in some cases, 
      artificial intelligence. The postpandemic learning environment has also changed, 
      emphasizing online learning and skill- and competency-based teaching models 
      incorporating clinical and bench-top research. Attempts to improve work-life 
      balance and minimize physician burnout have led to work-hour restrictions in 
      postgraduate training programs. These restrictions have made it particularly 
      challenging for orthopedic and neurosurgery residents to acquire the knowledge 
      and skill set to meet the requirements for certification. The fast-paced flow of 
      information and the rapid implementation of innovation require higher 
      efficiencies in the modern postgraduate training environment. However, what is 
      taught typically lags several years behind. Examples include minimally invasive 
      tissue-sparing techniques through tubular small-bladed retractor systems, robotic 
      and navigation, endoscopic, patient-specific implants made possible by advances 
      in imaging technology and 3D printing, and regenerative strategies. Currently, 
      the traditional roles of mentee and mentor are being redefined. The future 
      orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons involved in personalized surgical pain 
      management will need to be versed in several disciplines ranging from 
      bioengineering, basic research, computer, social and health sciences, clinical 
      study, trial design, public health policy development, and economic 
      accountability. Solutions to the fast-paced innovation cycle in orthopedic 
      surgery and neurosurgery include adaptive learning skills to seize opportunities 
      for innovation with execution and implementation by facilitating translational 
      research and clinical program development across traditional boundaries between 
      clinical and nonclinical specialties. Preparing the future generation of surgeons 
      to have the aptitude to keep up with the rapid technological advances is 
      challenging for postgraduate residency programs and accreditation agencies. 
      However, implementing clinical protocol change when the entrepreneur-investigator 
      surgeon substantiates it with high-grade clinical evidence is at the heart of 
      personalized surgical pain management.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a prevalent condition impacting 
      around 20% of people globally; resulting in patients living with pain, fatigue, 
      restricted social and employment capacity, and reduced quality of life. 
      Interdisciplinary multimodal pain treatment programs have been shown to provide 
      positive outcomes by supporting patients modify their behavior and improve pain 
      management through focusing attention on specific patient valued goals rather 
      than fighting pain. METHODS: Given the complex nature of chronic pain there is no 
      single clinical measure to assess outcomes from multimodal pain programs. Using 
      Centre for Integral Rehabilitation data from 2019-2021 (n = 2,364), we developed 
      a multidimensional machine learning framework of 13 outcome measures across 5 
      clinically relevant domains including activity/disability, pain, fatigue, coping 
      and quality of life. Machine learning models for each endpoint were separately 
      trained using the most important 30 of 55 demographic and baseline variables 
      based on minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection. Five-fold cross 
      validation identified best performing algorithms which were rerun on deidentified 
      source data to verify prognostic accuracy. RESULTS: Individual algorithm 
      performance ranged from 0.49 to 0.65 AUC reflecting characteristic outcome 
      variation across patients, and unbalanced training data with high positive 
      proportions of up to 86% for some measures. As expected, no single outcome 
      provided a reliable indicator, however the complete set of algorithms established 
      a stratified prognostic patient profile. Patient level validation achieved 
      consistent prognostic assessment of outcomes for 75.3% of the study group 
      (n = 1,953). Clinician review of a sample of predicted negative patients (n = 81) 
      independently confirmed algorithm accuracy and suggests the prognostic profile is 
      potentially valuable for patient selection and goal setting. DISCUSSION: These 
      results indicate that although no single algorithm was individually conclusive, 
      the complete stratified profile consistently identified patient outcomes. Our 
      predictive profile provides promising positive contribution for clinicians and 
      patients to assist with personalized assessment and goal setting, program 
      engagement and improved patient outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patient comprehension of informed consent and demonstration of 
      procedural understanding is often lacking in anesthesiology. The purpose of this 
      study was to determine if patient communication in anesthesiology is being 
      conducted effectively, and in a manner that ensures adequate communication 
      between anesthesia professionals and their patients regarding procedures with 
      associated risks and benefits. METHODS: Anesthesia professionals were recorded in 
      a simulated setting explaining anesthesia procedures of increasing complexity 
      with one control scenario. Score means were calculated, and statistical 
      comparisons made between discussion of anesthesia procedures and the control 
      scenario. RESULTS: Calculation of means for 6 readability tests demonstrated the 
      grade level required to understand the medical practitioners' verbal 
      communication was high and increased with complexity of the anesthesia procedure 
      described. The control scenario required a statistically significant lower level 
      of comprehension for the recipient of the information. CONCLUSION: In simulated 
      settings, anesthesia professionals regularly communicate procedural details in a 
      manner that is difficult for the general public to understand. Subjects could 
      communicate in simple terms when discussing a control. INNOVATION: This pilot 
      study demonstrated effective methodology, using artificial intelligence 
      technology for transcription, to assess patient comprehension of verbal 
      communication.

TI  - A machine-learning approach for decision support and risk stratification of 
      pediatric perioperative patients based on the APRICOT dataset.
PG  - 710-719
LID - 10.1111/pan.14694 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric anesthesia has evolved to a high level of patient safety, 
      yet a small chance remains for serious perioperative complications, even in those 
      traditionally considered at low risk. In practice, prediction of at-risk patients 
      currently relies on the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 
      (ASA-PS) score, despite reported inconsistencies with this method. AIMS: The goal 
      of this study was to develop predictive models that can classify children as low 
      risk for anesthesia at the time of surgical booking and after anesthetic 
      assessment on the procedure day. METHODS: Our dataset was derived from APRICOT, a 
      prospective observational cohort study conducted by 261 European institutions in 
      2014 and 2015. We included only the first procedure, ASA-PS classification I to 
      III, and perioperative adverse events not classified as drug errors, reducing the 
      total number of records to 30 325 with an adverse event rate of 4.43%. From this 
      dataset, a stratified train:test split of 70:30 was used to develop predictive 
      machine learning algorithms that could identify children in ASA-PS class I to III 
      at low risk for severe perioperative critical events that included respiratory, 
      cardiac, allergic, and neurological complications. RESULTS: Our selected models 
      achieved accuracies of >0.9, areas under the receiver operating curve of 0.6-0.7, 
      and negative predictive values >95%. Gradient boosting models were the best 
      performing for both the booking phase and the day-of-surgery phase. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This work demonstrates that prediction of patients at low risk of critical PAEs 
      can be made on an individual, rather than population-based, level by using 
      machine learning. Our approach yielded two models that accommodate wide clinical 
      variability and, with further development, are potentially generalizable to many 
      surgical centers.

TI  - Fetal heart rate changes and labor neuraxial analgesia: a machine learning 
      approach.
PG  - 329

LID - 329
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuraxial labor analgesia has been associated with fetal heart rate 
      changes. Fetal bradycardia is multifactorial, and predicting it poses a 
      significant challenge to clinicians. Machine learning algorithms may assist the 
      clinician to predict fetal bradycardia and identify predictors associated with 
      its presentation. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 1077 healthy laboring 
      parturients receiving neuraxial analgesia was conducted. We compared a principal 
      components regression model with tree-based random forest, ridge regression, 
      multiple regression, a general additive model, and elastic net in terms of 
      prediction accuracy and interpretability for inference purposes. RESULTS: 
      Multiple regression identified combined spinal-epidural (CSE) (p = 0.02), 
      interaction between CSE and dose of phenylephrine (p < 0.0001), decelerations 
      (p < 0.001), and the total dose of bupivacaine (p = 0.03) as associated with 
      decrease in fetal heart rate. Random forest exhibited good predictive accuracy 
      (mean standard error of 0.92). CONCLUSION: Use of CSE, presence of decelerations, 
      total dose of bupivacaine, and total dose of vasopressors after CSE are 
      associated with decreases in fetal heart rate in healthy parturients during 
      labor. Prediction of changes in fetal heart rate can be approached with a 
      tree-based random forest model with good accuracy with important variables that 
      are key for the prediction, such as CSE, BMI, duration of stage 1 of labor, and 
      dose of bupivacaine.

TI  - Feature Selection Based on a Genetic Algorithm for Optimizing Weaning Success.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI230206 [doi]
AB  - Finding the right time for weaning from ventilator is a difficult clinical 
      decision. Several systems based on machine or deep learning are reported in 
      literature. However, the results of these applications are not completely 
      satisfactory and may be improved. An important aspect is represented by the 
      features used as input of these systems. In this paper we present the results of 
      the application of genetic algorithms to perform feature selection on a dataset 
      containing 13688 patients under mechanical ventilation characterizing by 58 
      variables, extracted from the MIMIC III database. The results show that all 
      features are important, but four of them are essential: 'Sedation_days', 
      'Mean_Airway_Pressure', 'PaO2', and 'Chloride'. This is only the initial step to 
      obtain a tool to be added to the other clinical indices for minimize the risk of 
      extubation failure.

TI  - Perioperative Handoff Enhancement Opportunities Through Technology and Artificial 
      Intelligence: A Narrative Review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perioperative handoffs occur as patients progress through 
      preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of care. These may occur 
      between clinicians from the same or different role groups, between different care 
      units, for brief breaks during the course of a surgery, or at shift or service 
      changes. Perioperative handoffs occur during a period of increased vulnerability, 
      as teams must convey critical information at a time of high cognitive load, with 
      many potential distractions. METHODS: A search of MEDLINE was conducted for 
      biomedical literature pertaining to perioperative handoffs and technology, 
      electronic tools, and artificial intelligence. The reference lists of identified 
      articles were reviewed, and additional citations were included if relevant. These 
      articles were abstracted to summarize the current literature, and to frame the 
      opportunity for enhanced opportunities to improve perioperative handoffs through 
      technology and artificial intelligence. RESULTS: Several efforts to date have 
      incorporated electronic tools to improve perioperative handoffs but have been 
      limited by imprecision in selecting handoff elements, increased task burden for 
      clinicians, interrupted workflows, physical barriers, and lack of institutional 
      support for their implementation. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) 
      and machine learning (ML) are being applied across healthcare, but their use in 
      and integration into handoff workflows have not yet been studied. Use of existing 
      technology including mobile applications, barcode scanners, and radio-frequency 
      identification (RFID) tags to advance perioperative safety has only begun and 
      similarly has not been applied to handoffs. CONCLUSION: In this narrative review, 
      we synthesize prior research on electronic tools for perioperative handoffs, 
      limitations of current tools and barriers to their implementation, and the use of 
      AI and ML in perioperative care. We then discuss potential opportunities to 
      further integrate healthcare technologies and apply AI-derived solutions in the 
      concept of a "smart handoff" with the aim of reducing harm from handoffs and 
      improving patient safety.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and "the Art of Kintsugi" in Anesthesiology: ten 
      influential papers for clinical users.
PG  - 804-811

AB  - Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in 
      machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. In the 
      present review we chose ten influential papers from the last five years and 
      through Kintsugi, shed the light on recent evolution of artificial intelligence 
      in anesthesiology. A comprehensive search in in Medline, Embase, Web of Science 
      and Scopus databases was conducted. Each author searched the databases 
      independently and created a list of six articles that influenced their clinical 
      practice during this period, with a focus on their area of competence. During a 
      subsequent step, each researcher presented his own list and most cited papers 
      were selected to create the final collection of ten articles. In recent years 
      purely methodological works with a cryptic technology (black-box) represented by 
      the intact and static vessel, translated to a "modern artificial intelligence" in 
      clinical practice and comprehensibility (glass-box). The purposes of this review 
      are to explore the ten most cited papers about artificial intelligence in 
      anesthesiology and to understand how and when it should be integrated in clinical 
      practice.

TI  - Clin-STAR corner: 2021 update in musculoskeletal pain in older adults with a 
      focus on osteoarthritis-related pain.
PG  - 2373-2380
LID - 10.1111/jgs.18369 [doi]
AB  - Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain remains a leading cause of disability and 
      functional impairment among older adults and is associated with substantial 
      societal and personal costs. Chronic pain is particularly challenging to manage 
      in older adults because of multimorbidity, concerns about treatment-related harm, 
      as well as older adults' beliefs about pain and its management. This narrative 
      review presents data on nine high-quality, peer-reviewed clinical trials 
      published primarily over the past two years that focus on MSK pain management in 
      older adults, of which four were comprehensively reviewed. These studies address 
      contributors to knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain (insomnia), provide evidence for 
      digital delivery or artificial intelligence driven behavioral interventions and 
      potentially more efficient/equally effective modes of delivering glucocorticoids 
      for OA; each of the selected studies have potential for scalability and 
      meaningful impact in the care of older adults.

TI  - Machine Learning for Postoperative Continuous Recovery Scores of Oncology 
      Patients in Perioperative Care with Data from Wearables.
LID - 10.3390/s23094455 [doi]
LID - 4455
AB  - Assessing post-operative recovery is a significant component of perioperative 
      care, since this assessment might facilitate detecting complications and 
      determining an appropriate discharge date. However, recovery is difficult to 
      assess and challenging to predict, as no universally accepted definition exists. 
      Current solutions often contain a high level of subjectivity, measure recovery 
      only at one moment in time, and only investigate recovery until the discharge 
      moment. For these reasons, this research aims to create a model that predicts 
      continuous recovery scores in perioperative care in the hospital and at home for 
      objective decision making. This regression model utilized vital signs and 
      activity metrics measured using wearable sensors and the XGBoost algorithm for 
      training. The proposed model described continuous recovery profiles, obtained a 
      high predictive performance, and provided outcomes that are interpretable due to 
      the low number of features in the final model. Moreover, activity features, the 
      circadian rhythm of the heart, and heart rate recovery showed the highest feature 
      importance in the recovery model. Patients could be identified with fast and slow 
      recovery trajectories by comparing patient-specific predicted profiles to the 
      average fast- and slow-recovering populations. This identification may facilitate 
      determining appropriate discharge dates, detecting complications, preventing 
      readmission, and planning physical therapy. Hence, the model can provide an 
      automatic and objective decision support tool.

TI  - Effect of Intraoperative Infusion of Esketamine on Quality of Postoperative 
      Recovery in Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery: A Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 979-992
LID - 10.1007/s40122-023-00519-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of esketamine on 
      postoperative recovery quality after laparoscopic bariatric surgery. METHODS: 
      Patients (n = 74) scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomly 
      divided into two groups: the esketamine group (group E: 0.5 mg/kg/h infusion, 
      i.e., 0.2 mL/kg/h) or the control group (group C: 0.2 mL/kg/h normal saline 
      infusion). The infusions were stopped 20 min before the end of the procedure. The 
      primary outcome was the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) score on postoperative 
      day 1 (POD 1). The secondary outcomes included QoR-40 scores on PODs 2 and 7, 
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) on PODs 1, 2, and 7, time to extubation, additional 
      postoperative analgesic use, length of hospital stay, and time to first exhaust. 
      Additonally, the safety indices were also recorded, including hemodynamic 
      profile, perioperative anesthesia index (Ai), utilization of vasoactive drugs or 
      urapidil, and side effects. RESULTS: All in all, 70 of the 74 patients completed 
      the study, 35 in each group. The difference of QoR-40 scores on POD 1 was both 
      statistically and clinically significant [difference 7.21, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 5.17, 9.25, p < 0.001]. The difference of QoR-40 on POD 2 was 
      statistically significant but clinically insignificant (difference 4.81, 95% CI 
      2.69, 6.92, p < 0.001). The difference of NRS scores on POD 1 was statistically 
      significant (difference -1.23, 95% CI -2.36, -0.10, p = 0.033). Compared with 
      group C, group E had a lower utilization rate of phenylephrine and higher Ai 
      values (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the two groups on 
      other measures. CONCLUSION: Continuous ketamine infusion seems to be safe and 
      well tolerated in laparoscopic bariatric surgery. It improved the quality of 
      postoperative recovery and reduced pain on POD 1. In spite of the increased Ai 
      value during the surgery, it also provided better hemodynamics with less usage of 
      phenylephrine.

TI  - Anesthesiologists' Perspective on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in 
      Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anaesthesia in Terms of Medical Ethics and Medical 
      Education: A Survey Study.
PG  - 146-151
LID - 10.5152/eurasianjmed.2023.22254 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Controversy exists around the world as experts disagree on what 
      artificial intelligence will imply for humanity in the future. Medical experts 
      are starting to share perspectives on artificial intelligence with ethical and 
      legal concerns appearing to prevail. The purpose of this study was to determine 
      how anesthesiology and reanimation specialists in Turkey perceive the use of 
      artificial intelligence in ultrasound-guided regional anesthetic applications in 
      terms of medical ethics and education, as well as their perspectives on potential 
      ethical issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive and cross-sectional 
      survey was conducted across Turkey between July 1 and August 31. Data were 
      collected through an online questionnaire distributed by national associations 
      and social media platforms. The questionnaire included questions about the 
      descriptive features of the participants and the possible ethical problems that 
      may be encountered in the use of artificial intelligence in regional anesthesia 
      and 20 statements that were requested to be evaluated. RESULTS: The average age 
      of the 285 anesthesiologists who took part in the study was 42.00 ± 7.51, 144 of 
      them were male, the average years spent in the field was 10.95 ± 7.15 years, 
      59.3% were involved in resident training, and 74.7% habitually used ultrasound 
      guidance regional anesthetic applications. Of the participants, 80% thought 
      artificial intelligence would benefit patients, 86.7% thought it would benefit 
      resident training, 81.4% thought it would benefit post-graduate medical 
      education, and 80.7% thought it would decrease complications in practice. There 
      will be no ethical issues if sonographic data are captured anonymously, according 
      to 78.25%, while 67% are concerned about who will be held accountable for 
      inaccuracies. CONCLUSION: The majority of anesthetists believe that using 
      artificial intelligence in regional anesthetic applications will decrease 
      complications. Although ethical concerns about privacy and data governance are 
      low, participants do have ethical worries about "accountability for errors."

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the prognostic value of HRV measurements during anesthesia 
      for postoperative clinical outcomes prediction using machine learning models. 
      DATA SOURCES: VitalDB, a comprehensive database of 6388 surgical patients 
      admitted to Seoul National University Hospital. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY 
      SELECTION: Cases with ECG lead II recording duration of less than one hour were 
      excluded. Cases with more than 20% of missing HRV measurements were also 
      excluded. A total of 5641 cases were eligible for the analyses. METHODS: Six 
      machine learning models including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector 
      Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBT), 
      Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and an ensemble of the five baseline models were 
      developed to predict postoperative clinical outcomes. The prediction models were 
      trained using only clinical information, and using both clinical information and 
      HRV features, respectively. Feature importance based on the SHAP method was used 
      to assess the contribution of the HRV measurements to the outcome predictions. 
      Subgroup analysis was also performed to evaluate the risk association between 
      postoperative ICU stay and various HRV measurements such as heart rate, 
      low-frequency power (LFP), and short-term fluctuation DFA [Formula: see text]. 
      RESULT: The final cohort included 5641 unique cases, among whom 4678 (83.0%) 
      cases had ages over 40, 2877 (51.0%) were male, 1073 (19.0%) stayed in ICU after 
      surgery, 52 (0.9%) suffered in-hospital death, and 3167(56.1%) had a total length 
      of hospital stay longer than 7 days. In the final test set, the highest AUROC 
      performance with only clinical information was 0.79 for postoperative ICU stay, 
      0.58 for in-hospital mortality, and 0.76 for the total length of hospital stay 
      prediction. Importantly, using both clinical information and HRV features, the 
      AUROC performance was 0.83, 0.70, and 0.76 for the three clinical outcome 
      predictions, respectively. Subgroup analysis found that patients with an average 
      heart rate higher than 70, low-frequency power (LFP) < 33, and short-term 
      fluctuation DFA [Formula: see text] < 0.95 during anesthesia, had a significantly 
      higher risk of entering the ICU after surgery. CONCLUSION: This study suggested 
      that HRV measurements during anesthesia are feasible and effective for predicting 
      postoperative clinical outcomes.

AB  - Risk-based strategies are widely used for decision making in the prophylaxis of 
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), a major complication of general 
      anesthesia. However, whether risk is associated with individual treatment effect 
      remains uncertain. Here, we used machine learning-based algorithms for estimating 
      the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) (double machine learning [DML], 
      doubly robust [DR] learner, forest DML, and generalized random forest) to predict 
      the treatment response heterogeneity of dexamethasone, the first choice for 
      prophylactic antiemetics. Electronic health record data of 2026 adult patients 
      who underwent general anesthesia from January to June 2020 were analyzed. The 
      results indicated that only a small subset of patients respond to dexamethasone 
      treatment, and many patients may be non-responders. Estimated CATE did not 
      correlate with predicted risk, suggesting that risk may not be associated with 
      individual treatment responses. The current study suggests that predicting 
      treatment responders by CATE models may be more appropriate for clinical decision 
      making than conventional risk-based strategy.

TI  - A fully-automatic semi-supervised deep learning model for difficult airway

AB  - BACKGROUND: Difficult airway conditions represent a substantial challenge for 
      clinicians. Predicting such conditions is essential for subsequent treatment 
      planning, but the reported diagnostic accuracies are still quite low. To overcome 
      these challenges, we developed a rapid, non-invasive, cost-effective, and 
      highly-accurate deep-learning approach to identify difficult airway conditions 
      through photographic image analysis. METHODS: For each of 1000 patients scheduled 
      for elective surgery under general anesthesia, images were captured from 9 
      specific and different viewpoints. The collected image set was divided into 
      training and testing subsets in the ratio of 8:2. We used a semi-supervised 
      deep-learning method to train and test an AI model for difficult airway 
      prediction. RESULTS: We trained our semi-supervised deep-learning model using 
      only 30% of the labeled training samples (with the remaining 70% used without 
      labels). We evaluated the model performance using metrics of accuracy, 
      sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The 
      numerical values of these four metrics were found to be 90.00%, 89.58%, 90.13%, 
      81.13%, and 0.9435, respectively. For a fully-supervised learning scheme (with 
      100% of the labeled training samples used for model training), the corresponding 
      values were 90.50%, 91.67%, 90.13%, 82.25%, and 0.9457, respectively. When three 
      professional anesthesiologists conducted comprehensive evaluation, the 
      corresponding results were 91.00%, 91.67%, 90.79%, 83.26%, and 0.9497, 
      respectively. It can be seen that the semi-supervised deep learning model trained 
      by us with only 30% labeled samples can achieve a comparable effect with the 
      fully supervised learning model, but the sample labeling cost is smaller. Our 
      method can achieve a good balance between performance and cost. At the same time, 
      the results of the semi-supervised model trained with only 30% labeled samples 
      were very close to the performance of human experts. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of 
      our knowledge, our study is the first one to apply a semi-supervised 
      deep-learning method in order to identify the difficulties of both mask 
      ventilation and intubation. Our AI-based image analysis system can be used as an 
      effective tool to identify patients with difficult airway conditions. CLINICAL

TI  - Dynamic prediction of hypoxemia risk at different time points based on 
      preoperative and intraoperative features: machine learning applications in 
      outpatients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
PG  - 1156-1167
LID - 10.1080/07853890.2023.2187878 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoxemia often occurs in outpatients undergoing anesthesia-assisted 
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). However, there is a scarcity in tools to 
      predict the hypoxemia risk. We aimed to solve this problem by developing and 
      validating machine learning (ML) models based on preoperative and intraoperative 
      features. METHODS: All data were retrospectively collected from June 2021 to 
      February 2022. The most appropriate predictive features were selected by the 
      least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, which were incorporated and 
      modelled by 4 ML algorithms. The area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) 
      was used as the main evaluation metric to select the best models, and the 
      selected models were compared with the STOP-BANG score. Their predictive 
      performance was visually interpreted by SHapley Additive exPlanations. The 
      primary endpoint of this study was hypoxemia during the procedure, defined as at 
      least one reading of pulse oximetry < 90% without probes misplacement from the 
      anesthesia induction beginning to the end of EGD, while the secondary endpoint 
      was hypoxemia during induction, from the induction beginning to the start of 
      endoscopic intubation. RESULTS: Of 1160 patients in the derivation cohort, 112 
      patients (9.6%) developed intraoperative hypoxemia, of which 102 (8.8%) occurred 
      during the induction period. In temporal and external validation, no matter 
      whether based on preoperative variables or still based on preoperative plus 
      intraoperative variables, our models showed excellent predictive performance for 
      the two endpoints, significantly better than STOP-BANG score. In the model 
      interpretation section, preoperative variables (airway assessment indicators, 
      pulse oximeter oxygen saturation and BMI) and intraoperative variables (the 
      induced propofol dose) made the highest contribution to the predictions. To our 
      knowledge, our ML models were the first to predict hypoxemia risk, which achieved 
      excellent overall predictive ability integrating various clinical indicators. 
      These models have the potential to become an effective tool for adjusting 
      sedation strategies flexibly and reducing the workload of anesthesiologists.KEY 
      MESSAGESThis study is the first model employing ML methods based on preoperative 
      and preoperative plus intraoperative variables for predicting the risk of 
      hypoxemia during induction and the whole EGD procedure respectively.Our four 
      models achieved satisfactory predictive performance and outperformed STOP-BANG 
      score in terms of AUPRC in the temporal and external validation cohorts 
      respectively.We found that the relevant variables of airway assessment should be 
      fully taken into account when analyzing the risk factor of hypoxemia, and the 
      effect of patients' age on their hypoxemia risk should be considered in 
      conjunction with the propofol dose.

AB  - Managing pain is essential for social, psychological, physical, and economic 
      reasons. It is also a human right with a growing incidence of untreated and 
      under-treated pain globally. Barriers to diagnosing, assessing, treating, and 
      managing pain are complicated, subjective, and driven by patient, healthcare 
      provider, payer, policy, and regulatory challenges. In addition, conventional 
      treatment methods pose their own challenges including the subjectivity of 
      assessment, lack of therapeutic innovation over the last decade, opioid use 
      disorder and financial access to treatment. Digital health innovations hold much 
      promise in providing complementary solutions to traditional medical interventions 
      and may reduce cost and speed up recovery or adaptation. There is a growing 
      evidence base for the use of digital health in pain assessment, diagnosis, and 
      management. The challenge is not only to develop new technologies and solutions, 
      but to do this within a framework that supports health equity, scalability, 
      socio-cultural consideration, and evidence-based science. The extensive limits to 
      physical personal interaction during the Covid-19 pandemic 2020/21 has proven the 
      possible role of digital health in the field of pain medicine. This paper 
      provides an overview of the use of digital health in pain management and argues 
      for the use of a systemic framework in evaluating the efficacy of digital health 
      solutions.

AB  - Preoperative risk assessment is essential for shared decision-making and adequate 
      perioperative care. Common scores provide limited predictive quality and lack 
      personalized information. The aim of this study was to create an interpretable 
      machine-learning-based model to assess the patient's individual risk of 
      postoperative mortality based on preoperative data to allow analysis of personal 
      risk factors. After ethical approval, a model for prediction of postoperative 
      in-hospital mortality based on preoperative data of 66,846 patients undergoing 
      elective non-cardiac surgery between June 2014 and March 2020 was created with 
      extreme gradient boosting. Model performance and the most relevant parameters 
      were shown using receiver operating characteristic (ROC-) and precision-recall 
      (PR-) curves and importance plots. Individual risks of index patients were 
      presented in waterfall diagrams. The model included 201 features and showed good 
      predictive abilities with an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 
      curve of 0.95 and an area under precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.109. The 
      feature with the highest information gain was the preoperative order for red 
      packed cell concentrates followed by age and c-reactive protein. Individual risk 
      factors could be identified on patient level. We created a highly accurate and 
      interpretable machine learning model to preoperatively predict the risk of 
      postoperative in-hospital mortality. The algorithm can be used to identify 
      factors susceptible to preoperative optimization measures and to identify risk 
      factors influencing individual patient risk.

TI  - Hypotension Prediction Index guided Goal Directed therapy and the amount of 
      Hypotension during Major Gynaecologic Oncologic Surgery: a Randomized Controlled 
      clinical Trial.
PG  - 1081-1093

AB  - Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is associated with increased morbidity and 
      mortality. Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) is a machine learning derived 
      algorithm that predicts IOH shortly before it occurs. We tested the hypothesis 
      that the application of the HPI in combination with a pre-defined Goal Directed 
      Therapy (GDT) hemodynamic protocol reduces IOH during major gynaecologic 
      oncologic surgery. We enrolled women scheduled for major gynaecologic oncologic 
      surgery under general anesthesia with invasive arterial pressure monitoring. 
      Patients were randomized to a GDT protocol aimed at optimizing stroke volume 
      index (SVI) or hemodynamic management based on HPI guidance in addition to GDT. 
      The primary outcome was the amount of IOH, defined as the timeweighted average 
      (TWA) mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 65 mmHg. Secondary outcome was the 
      TWA-MAP < 65 mmHg during the first 20 min after induction of GA. After exclusion 
      of 10 patients the final analysis included 60 patients (30 in each group). The 
      median (25-75th IQR) TWA-MAP < 65 mmHg was 0.14 (0.04-0.66) mmHg in HPI group 
      versus 0.77 (0.36-1.30) mmHg in Control group, P < 0.001. During the first 20 min 
      after induction of GA, the median TWA-MAP < 65 mmHg was 0.53 (0.06-1.8) mmHg in 
      the HPI group and 2.15 (0.65-4.2) mmHg in the Control group, P = 0.001. Compared 
      to a GDT protocol aimed to SVI optimization, a machine learning-derived algorithm 
      for prediction of IOH combined with a GDT hemodynamic protocol, reduced IOH and 
      hypotension after induction of general anesthesia in patients undergoing major 
      gynaecologic oncologic surgery.Trial registration number: NCT04547491. Date of 
      registration: 10/09/2020.

AB  - The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the criticality of timely 
      intervention in a situation exacerbated by a shortage in medical staff and 
      equipment. Pain-level screening is the initial step toward identifying the 
      severity of patient conditions. Automatic recognition of state and feelings help 
      in identifying patient symptoms to take immediate adequate action and providing a 
      patient-centric medical plan tailored to a patient's state. In this paper, we 
      propose a framework for pain-level detection for deployment in the United Arab 
      Emirates and assess its performance using the most used approaches in the 
      literature. Our results show that a deployment of a pain-level deep learning 
      detection framework is promising in identifying the pain level accurately.

      Complications in Elderly: A Single-Center Retrospective Study from China.
PG  - 597-606
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S406735 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The predictive effect of systemic inflammatory factors on 
      postoperative pulmonary complications in elderly patients remains unclear. In 
      addition, machine learning models are rarely used in prediction models for 
      elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated elderly 
      patients who underwent general anesthesia during a 6-year period. Eligible 
      patients were randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to the development group and 
      validation group. The Least logistic absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
      (LASSO) regression model and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to 
      select the optimal feature. The discrimination, calibration and net 
      reclassification improvement (NRI) of the final model were compared with "the 
      Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalonia" (ARISCAT) model. 
      RESULTS: Of the 9775 patients analyzed, 8.31% developed PPCs. The final model 
      included age, preoperative SpO2, ANS (the Albumin/NLR Score), operation time, and 
      red blood cells (RBC) transfusion. The concordance index (C-index) values of the 
      model for the development cohort and the validation cohort were 0.740 and 0.748, 
      respectively. The P values of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test in two cohorts were 
      insignificant. Our model outperformed ARISCAT model, with C-index (0.740 VS 
      0.717, P = 0.003) and NRI (0.117, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Based on LASSO machine 
      learning algorithm, we constructed a prediction model superior to ARISCAT model 
      in predicting the risk of PPCs. Clinicians could utilize these predictors to 
      optimize prospective and preventive interventions in this patient population.

TI  - Aorto-iliac and infrainguinal artery occlusive disease: different 
      revascularization options according to the critical limb threatening ischemia 
      category.
PG  - 209-215
LID - 10.23736/S0392-9590.23.04992-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Critical limb threatening-ischemia (CLTI) can be due to an extensive 
      involvement of both the aorto-iliac (AI) and the infra-inguinal (II) districts 
      and the efficacy of and extensive AI+II vs. only AI revascularization is still 
      matter of debate. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the outcome in 
      CLTI patients with concomitant AI and II peripheral artery disease (PAD) after 
      revascularization limited to the AI or extended also to the II segment. METHODS: 
      Patients with CLTI and concomitant AI (TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus: C-D) 
      and II PAD (Global-Anatomic-Staging-System: II-III) from 2016 to 2021 were 
      retrospectively evaluated. Patients were compared according to type of 
      revascularization: limited to AI vs. AI+II. Common femoral and profunda artery 
      endarterectomy (C/P-TEA) was considered in both groups. Perioperative mortality, 
      limb salvage, foot healing (within 6 months after surgery), necessity of 
      adjunctive revascularization and survival were analyzed and the follow-up 
      performed with clinical and duplex assessment every six months. The primary 
      endpoint was to evaluate the composite event of limb salvage, wound healing and 
      necessity of adjunctive revascularization during follow-up in AI vs. AI+II 
      groups, through Kaplan Meier and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Over a total 
      of 1105 peripheral revascularizations for CLTI, 96 (8.7%) patients met the 
      inclusion criteria for the study. AI revascularization was performed in 38 (40%) 
      and AI+II in 58 (60%). AI and AI+II groups were similar for preoperative risk 
      factors and extension of PAD with the exception of American Society of 
      Anesthesiology (ASA) Classification (ASA IV: 50% vs. 25%, P=0.02, respectively). 
      The AI group was treated with angioplasty/stenting in all cases and with C/P-TEA 
      in 20 (52%) cases. In the AI+II group, the AI district was treated by 
      angioplasty/stenting in 55 (95%) and by aorto-bifemoral bypass in 3 (5%) and 
      C/P-TEA in 20 (34%). The II revascularization was performed by 
      femoro-popliteal/tibial bypass in 27 (47%); and endovascular revascularization in 
      31 (53%) patients. Minor amputation rate was similar between AI and AI+II 
      revascularization (39% vs. 48%, P=1.0); length of stay, blood transfusion units, 
      were significantly higher in AI+II group: 7±4 days vs. 12±5 days, P=0.04 and 2±2 
      vs. 4±2, P=0.02. The 30-day mortality was 7% with no differences according to the 
      type of treatment. At a mean follow-up of 28±10 months, the overall limb salvage 
      was 87±4% with similar results in AI vs. AI+II revascularization (95±5% vs. 
      86±6%; P=0.56). AI had a higher necessity of adjunctive revascularization and 
      lower wound healing compared to AI+II (18±9% vs. 0%, P=0.02; 72% vs. 100%, 
      P=0.001, respectively). AI+II was associated with a better primary endpoint 
      compared to AI (87±5% vs. 53±9%, P=0.01), and it was confirmed in Rutherford 5 
      and 6 patients (100% vs. 54±14%, P=0.01; 78±9 vs. 50±13%, P=0.04), and no 
      differences in Rutherford 4 (100% vs. 100%). Cox regression analysis confirmed 
      AI+II as an independent protector for the primary outcome (hazard ratio: 0.23, 
      95% confidence interval 0.08-0.71). CONCLUSIONS: CLTI with extensive PAD disease 
      can be treated with limited AI revascularization in Rutherford 4 patients however 
      in case of category 5 or 6 an extensive revascularization (AI+II) should be 
      considered.

AB  - PURPOSE: Fetal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (FCMR) can be used as an 
      imaging modality in fetal cardiovascular evaluation as studied in recent years. 
      We aimed to evaluate cardiovascular morphology using FCMR and to observe the 
      development of cardiovascular structures according to gestational age (GA) in 
      pregnant women. METHOD: In our prospective study, 120 pregnant women between 19 
      and 37 weeks of gestation in whom absence of cardiac anomaly could not be 
      excluded by ultrasonography (US) or, who were referred to us for magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) for suspected non-cardiovascular system pathology, were 
      included. According to the axis of the fetal heart, axial, coronal, and sagittal 
      multiplanar steady-state free precession (SSFP) and 'real time' untriggered SSFP 
      sequence, respectively, were obtained. The morphology of the cardiovascular 
      structures and their relationships with each other were evaluated, and their 
      sizes were measured. RESULTS: Seven cases (6.3%) contained motion artefacts that 
      did not allow the assessment and measurement of cardiovascular morphology, and 
      three (2.9%) cases with cardiac pathology in the analysed images were excluded 
      from the study. The study included a total of 100 cases. Cardiac chamber 
      diameter, heart diameter, heart length, heart area, thoracic diameter, and 
      thoracic area were measured in all fetuses. The diameters of the aorta ascendens 
      (Aa), aortic isthmus (Ai), aorta descendens (Ad), main pulmonary artery (MPA), 
      ductus arteriosus (DA, superior vena cava (SVC), and inferior vena cava (IVC) 
      were measured in all fetuses. The left pulmonary artery (LPA) was visualised in 
      89 patients (89%). The right PA (RPA) was visualised in 99 (99%) cases. Four 
      pulmonary veins (PVs) were seen in 49 (49%) cases, three in 33 (33%), and two in 
      18 (18%). High correlation values were found for all diameter measurements 
      performed with GW. CONCLUSION: In cases where US cannot achieve adequate image 
      quality, FCMR can contribute to diagnosis. The very short acquisition time and 
      parallel imaging technique with the SSFP sequence allow for adequate image 
      quality without maternal or fetal sedation.

AB  - Chronic pain (i.e., pain lasting ≥3 months) is a debilitating condition that 
      affects daily work and life activities for many adults in the United States and 
      has been linked with depression (1), Alzheimer disease and related dementias (2), 
      higher suicide risk (3), and substance use and misuse (4). During 2016, an 
      estimated 50 million adults in the United States experienced chronic pain, 
      resulting in substantial health care costs and lost productivity (5,6). 
      Addressing chronic pain and improving the lives of persons living with pain is a 
      public health imperative. Population research objectives in the National Pain 
      Strategy, which was released in 2016 by the Interagency Pain Research 
      Coordinating Committee, call for more precise estimates of the prevalence of 
      chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain (i.e., chronic pain that results in 
      substantial restriction to daily activities) in the general population and within 
      various population groups to guide efforts to reduce the impact of chronic pain 
      (3). Further, a 2022 review of U.S. chronic pain surveillance systems identified 
      the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) as the best source for pain 
      surveillance data (7). CDC analyzed data from the 2019-2021 NHIS to provide 
      updated estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain 
      among adults in the United States and within population groups defined by 
      demographic, geographic, socioeconomic, and health status characteristics. During 
      2021, an estimated 20.9% of U.S. adults (51.6 million persons) experienced 
      chronic pain, and 6.9% (17.1 million persons) experienced high-impact chronic 
      pain. New findings from this analysis include that non-Hispanic American Indian 
      or Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults, adults identifying as bisexual, and adults who 
      are divorced or separated are among the populations experiencing a higher 
      prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain. Clinicians, practices, 
      health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequities and 
      ensure access to appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective 
      pain management care for all persons (8).

TI  - Predicting postoperative delirium after hip arthroplasty for elderly patients 
      using machine learning.
PG  - 1241-1251
LID - 10.1007/s40520-023-02399-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and severe complication in 
      elderly hip-arthroplasty patients. AIM: This study aims to develop and validate a 
      machine learning (ML) model that determines essential features related to POD and 
      predicts POD for elderly hip-arthroplasty patients. METHODS: The electronic 
      record data of elderly patients who received hip-arthroplasty surgery between 
      January 2017 and April 2021 were enrolled as the dataset. The Confusion 
      Assessment Method (CAM) was administered to the patients during their 
      perioperative period. The feature section method was employed as a filter to 
      determine leading features. The classical machine learning algorithms were 
      trained in cross-validation processing, and the model with the best performance 
      was built in predicting the POD. Metrics of the area under the curve (AUC), 
      accuracy (ACC), sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score were calculated to 
      evaluate the predictive performance. RESULTS: 476 Arthroplasty elderly patients 
      with general anesthesia were included in this study, and the final model combined 
      feature selection method mutual information (MI) and linear binary classifier 
      using logistic regression (LR) achieved an encouraging performance (AUC = 0.94, 
      ACC = 0.88, sensitivity = 0.85, specificity = 0.90, F1-score = 0.87) on a 
      balanced test dataset. CONCLUSION: The model could predict POD with satisfying 
      accuracy and reveal important features of suffering POD such as age, Cystatin C, 
      GFR, CHE, CRP, LDH, monocyte count, history of mental illness or psychotropic 
      drug use and intraoperative blood loss. Proper preoperative interventions for 
      these factors could reduce the incidence of POD among elderly patients.

TI  - The Clinical Researcher Journey in the Artificial Intelligence Era: The PAC-MAN's 
      Challenge.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11070975 [doi]
LID - 975
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that can assist researchers and 
      clinicians in various settings. However, like any technology, it must be used 
      with caution and awareness as there are numerous potential pitfalls. To provide a 
      creative analogy, we have likened research to the PAC-MAN classic arcade video 
      game. Just as the protagonist of the game is constantly seeking data, researchers 
      are constantly seeking information that must be acquired and managed within the 
      constraints of the research rules. In our analogy, the obstacles that researchers 
      face are represented by "ghosts", which symbolize major ethical concerns, 
      low-quality data, legal issues, and educational challenges. In short, clinical 
      researchers need to meticulously collect and analyze data from various sources, 
      often navigating through intricate and nuanced challenges to ensure that the data 
      they obtain are both precise and pertinent to their research inquiry. Reflecting 
      on this analogy can foster a deeper comprehension of the significance of 
      employing AI and other powerful technologies with heightened awareness and 
      attentiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) is the main method for urinary 
      calculi. An anesthesia method with little effect on the blood circulation and 
      which does not affect the postoperative activity of a patient is lacking. 
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of paravertebral nerve block (PNB) and epidural 
      block (EPB) on quadriceps femoris muscle (QFM) strength in patients after PCNL. 
      METHODS: 163 patients were separated into two groups: EPB (81) and PNB (82). 
      Primary outcome parameters were QFM strength and range of motion (RoM) of the 
      knee 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 24 h after anesthesia induction (AI). Secondary outcome 
      parameters were: time from AI beginning to first ambulation; time of 
      sensory-plane recovery; amount of additional analgesics given during and after 
      surgery; prevalence of nausea and vomiting; duration of hospital stay (DoHS); 
      mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) 
      before, 0.5 h, and 1 h after AI; visual analog scale (VAS) score 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 
      3 h and 24 h after AI. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in QFM 
      strength or knee RoM before or 24 h after AI between the two groups (P > 0.05). 
      The time from AI to first ambulation was shorter (P < 0.05) and the sensory plane 
      took longer to recover (P < 0.05) in the PNB group than in the EPB group. The 
      amount of additional analgesics during surgery was more in the PNB group than in 
      the EPB group (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference after surgery 
      (P > 0.05). VAS scores were higher in the PNB group than in the EPB group 0.5 
      after AI (P < 0.05). MAP 1 h after AI was higher in the PNB group than in the EPB 
      group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of 
      postoperative nausea and vomiting, DoHS, HR, or SpO(2) at 0.5 h and 1 h after AI 
      between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing PCNL, PNB 
      can meet the need for surgical analgesia while having little effect on QFM 
      strength. TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.chictr.org.cn/, identifier

      January 2016 to January 2020) and prospectively enrolled 368 patients (from 
      February 2020 to October 2022; as verification cohort) with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) who received TACE in the Hepatic Surgery Center of Tongji 
      Hospital. Five predictive models were established using machine learning 
      algorithms, namely, random forest model (RFM), support vector machine model, 
      artificial neural network model, naive Bayes model and decision tree model. The 
      efficacy of these models in predicting postoperative pain was evaluated through 
      receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, decision curve analysis and 
      clinical impact curve analysis. RESULTS: A total of 24 candidate variables were 
      included in the predictive models using the iterative algorithms. Age, 
      preoperative pain, number of embolised tumours, distance from the liver capsule, 
      dosage of iodised oil and preoperative prothrombin activity were closely 
      associated with postoperative pain. The accuracy of the predictive model was 
      compared between the training [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.798; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 0.745-0.851] and verification (AUC = 0.871; 95%CI: 0.818-0.924) 
      cohorts, with RFM having the best predictive efficiency (training cohort: AUC = 
      0.869, 95%CI: 0.816-0.922; internal verification cohort: AUC = 0.871; 95%CI: 
      0.818-0.924). CONCLUSION: The five predictive models based on advanced machine 
      learning algorithms, especially RFM, can accurately predict the risk of pain 
      after TACE in patients with HCC. RFM can be used to assess the risk of pain for 
      facilitating preventive treatment and improving the prognosis.

AB  - Classifying the patient's depth of anesthesia (LoH) level into a few distinct 
      states may lead to inappropriate drug administration. To tackle the problem, this 
      paper presents a robust and computationally efficient framework that predicts a 
      continuous LoH index scale from 0-100 in addition to the LoH state. This paper 
      proposes a novel approach for accurate LoH estimation based on Stationary Wavelet 
      Transform (SWT) and fractal features. The deep learning model adopts an optimized 
      temporal, fractal, and spectral feature set to identify the patient sedation 
      level irrespective of age and the type of anesthetic agent. This feature set is 
      then fed into a multilayer perceptron network (MLP), a class of feed-forward 
      neural networks. A comparative analysis of regression and classification is made 
      to measure the performance of the chosen features on the neural network 
      architecture. The proposed LoH classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art LoH 
      prediction algorithms with the highest accuracy of 97.1% while utilizing 
      minimized feature set and MLP classifier. Moreover, for the first time, the LoH 
      regressor achieves the highest performance metrics ( [Formula: see text], MAE = 
      1.5) as compared to previous work. This study is very helpful for developing 
      highly accurate monitoring for LoH which is important for intraoperative and 
      postoperative patients' health.

TI  - Mapping the Design Space of Technology-Based Solutions for Better Chronic Pain 
      Care: Introducing the Pain Tech Landscape.
PG  - 612-618
LID - 10.1097/PSY.0000000000001200 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Technology has substantial potential to transform and extend care for 
      persons with chronic pain, a burdensome and costly condition. To catalyze the 
      development of impactful applications of technology in this space, we developed 
      the Pain Tech Landscape (PTL) model, which integrates pain care needs with 
      characteristics of technological solutions. METHODS: Our interdisciplinary group 
      representing experts in pain and human factors research developed PTL through 
      iterative discussions. To demonstrate one potential use of the model, we apply 
      data generated from a narrative review of selected pain and technology journals 
      (2000-2020) in the form of heat map overlays, to reveal where pain tech research 
      attention has focused to date. RESULTS: The PTL comprises three two-dimensional 
      planes, with pain care needs on each x axis (measurement to management) and 
      technology applications on the y axes according to a) user agency (user- to 
      system-driven), b) usage time frame (temporary to lifelong), and c) collaboration 
      (single-user to collaborative). Heat maps show that existing applications reside 
      primarily in the "user-driven/management" quadrant (e.g., self-care apps). 
      Examples of less developed areas include artificial intelligence and Internet of 
      Things (i.e., Internet-linked household objects), and collaborative/social tools 
      for pain management. CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative development between the pain and 
      tech fields in early developmental stages using the PTL as a common language 
      could yield impactful solutions for chronic pain management. The PTL could also 
      be used to track developments in the field over time. We encourage periodic 
      reassessment and refinement of the PTL model, which can also be adapted to other 
      chronic conditions.

TI  - INDIVIDUALIZED RISK ASSESSMENT OF PREOPERATIVE OPIOID USE BY INTERPRETABLE NEURAL 
      NETWORK REGRESSION.
PG  - 434-453
LID - 10.1214/22-aoas1634 [doi]
AB  - Preoperative opioid use has been reported to be associated with higher 
      preoperative opioid demand, worse postoperative outcomes, and increased 
      postoperative healthcare utilization and expenditures. Understanding the risk of 
      preoperative opioid use helps establish patient-centered pain management. In the 
      field of machine learning, deep neural network (DNN) has emerged as a powerful 
      means for risk assessment because of its superb prediction power; however, the 
      blackbox algorithms may make the results less interpretable than statistical 
      models. Bridging the gap between the statistical and machine learning fields, we 
      propose a novel Interpretable Neural Network Regression (INNER), which combines 
      the strengths of statistical and DNN models. We use the proposed INNER to conduct 
      individualized risk assessment of preoperative opioid use. Intensive simulations 
      and an analysis of 34,186 patients expecting surgery in the Analgesic Outcomes 
      Study (AOS) show that the proposed INNER not only can accurately predict the 
      preoperative opioid use using preoperative characteristics as DNN, but also can 
      estimate the patient-specific odds of opioid use without pain and the odds ratio 
      of opioid use for a unit increase in the reported overall body pain, leading to 
      more straight-forward interpretations of the tendency to use opioids than DNN. 
      Our results identify the patient characteristics that are strongly associated 
      with opioid use and is largely consistent with the previous findings, providing 
      evidence that INNER is a useful tool for individualized risk assessment of 
      preoperative opioid use.

TI  - Multiclass Support Vector Machine improves the Pivot-shift grading from Gerdy's 
      acceleration resultant prior to the acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament surgery.
LID - S0020-1383(23)00271-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.injury.2023.03.020 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rotatory laxity acceleration still lacks objective classification 
      due to interval grading superposition, resulting in a biased pivot shift grading 
      prior to the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However, data 
      analysis might help improve data grading in the operative room. Therefore, we 
      described the improvement of the pivot-shift categorization in Gerdy's 
      acceleration under anesthesia prior to ACL surgery using a support vector machine 
      (SVM) classification, surgeon, and literature reference. METHODS: Seventy-five 
      patients (aged 30.3 ± 10.2 years, and IKDC 52.0 ± 16.5 points) with acute ACL 
      rupture under anesthesia prior to ACL surgery were analyzed. Patients were graded 
      with pivot-shift sign glide (+), clunk (++), and (+++) gross by senior orthopedic 
      surgeons. At the same time, the tri-axial tibial plateau acceleration was 
      measured. Categorical data were statistically described, and the accelerometry 
      and categorical data were associated (α = 5%). A multiclass SVM kernel with the 
      best accuracy trained by orthopedic surgeons and assisted from literature for 
      missing data was compared with experienced surgeons and literature interval 
      grading. The cubic SVM classifier achieved the best grading. RESULTS: The 
      intra-group proportions were different for each grading in the three compared 
      strategies (p < 0.001). The inter-group proportions were different for all 
      comparisons (p < 0.001). There were significant (p < 0.001) associations (Tau: 
      0.69, -0.28, and -0.50) between the surgeon and SVM, the surgeon and interval 
      grading, and the interval and SVM, respectively. CONCLUSION: The multiclass SVM 
      classifier improves the acceleration categorization of the (+), (++), and (+++) 
      pivot shift sign prior to the ACL surgery in agreement with surgeon criteria.

TI  - Hypotension prediction index guided versus conventional goal directed therapy to 
      reduce intraoperative hypotension during thoracic surgery: a randomized trial.
PG  - 101
LID - 10.1186/s12871-023-02069-1 [doi]
LID - 101
AB  - PURPOSE: Intraoperative hypotension is linked to increased incidence of 
      perioperative adverse events such as myocardial and cerebrovascular infarction 
      and acute kidney injury. Hypotension prediction index (HPI) is a novel machine 
      learning guided algorithm which can predict hypotensive events using high 
      fidelity analysis of pulse-wave contour. Goal of this trial is to determine 
      whether use of HPI can reduce the number and duration of hypotensive events in 
      patients undergoing major thoracic procedures. METHODS: Thirty four patients 
      undergoing esophageal or lung resection were randomized into 2 groups -"machine 
      learning algorithm" (AcumenIQ) and "conventional pulse contour analysis" 
      (Flotrac). Analyzed variables were occurrence, severity and duration of 
      hypotensive events (defined as a period of at least one minute of MAP below 
      65 mmHg), hemodynamic parameters at 9 different timepoints interesting from a 
      hemodynamics viewpoint and laboratory (serum lactate levels, arterial blood gas) 
      and clinical outcomes (duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stay, 
      occurrence of adverse events and in-hospital and 28-day mortality). RESULTS: 
      Patients in the AcumenIQ group had significantly lower area below the hypotensive 
      threshold (AUT, 2 vs 16.7 mmHg x minutes) and time-weighted AUT (TWA, 0.01 vs 
      0.08 mmHg). Also, there were less patients with hypotensive events and cumulative 
      duration of hypotension in the AcumenIQ group. No significant difference between 
      groups was found in terms of laboratory and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Hemodynamic optimization guided by machine learning algorithm leads to a 
      significant decrease in number and duration of hypotensive events compared to 
      traditional goal directed therapy using pulse-contour analysis hemodynamic 
      monitoring in patients undergoing major thoracic procedures. Further, larger 
      studies are needed to determine true clinical utility of HPI guided hemodynamic 
      monitoring. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Date of first registration: 14/11/2022

      Management-A Literature Review.
LID - 10.3390/medicina59030491 [doi]
LID - 491
AB  - Intraoperative hypotension (IH) is a frequent phenomenon affecting a substantial 
      number of patients undergoing general anesthesia. The occurrence of IH is related 
      to significant perioperative complications, including kidney failure, myocardial 
      injury, and even increased mortality. Despite advanced hemodynamic monitoring and 
      protocols utilizing goal directed therapy, our management is still reactive; we 
      intervene when the episode of hypotension has already occurred. This literature 
      review evaluated the Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI), which is designed to 
      predict and reduce the incidence of IH. The HPI algorithm is based on a machine 
      learning algorithm that analyzes the arterial pressure waveform as an input and 
      the occurrence of hypotension with MAP <65 mmHg for at least 1 min as an output. 
      There are several studies, both retrospective and prospective, showing a 
      significant reduction in IH episodes with the use of the HPI algorithm. However, 
      the level of evidence on the use of HPI remains very low, and further studies are 
      needed to show the benefits of this algorithm on perioperative outcomes.

TI  - Attitudes of Anesthesiologists toward Artificial Intelligence in Anesthesia: A 
      Multicenter, Mixed Qualitative-Quantitative Study.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12062096 [doi]
LID - 2096
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to play an increasingly important role 
      in perioperative medicine in the very near future. However, little is known about 
      what anesthesiologists know and think about AI in this context. This is important 
      because the successful introduction of new technologies depends on the 
      understanding and cooperation of end users. We sought to investigate how much 
      anesthesiologists know about AI and what they think about the introduction of 
      AI-based technologies into the clinical setting. In order to better understand 
      what anesthesiologists think of AI, we recruited 21 anesthesiologists from 2 
      university hospitals for face-to-face structured interviews. The interview 
      transcripts were subdivided sentence-by-sentence into discrete statements, and 
      statements were then grouped into key themes. Subsequently, a survey of closed 
      questions based on these themes was sent to 70 anesthesiologists from 3 
      university hospitals for rating. In the interviews, the base level of knowledge 
      of AI was good at 86 of 90 statements (96%), although awareness of the potential 
      applications of AI in anesthesia was poor at only 7 of 42 statements (17%). 
      Regarding the implementation of AI in anesthesia, statements were split roughly 
      evenly between pros (46 of 105, 44%) and cons (59 of 105, 56%). Interviewees 
      considered that AI could usefully be used in diverse tasks such as risk 
      stratification, the prediction of vital sign changes, or as a treatment guide. 
      The validity of these themes was probed in a follow-up survey of 70 
      anesthesiologists with a response rate of 70%, which confirmed an overall 
      positive view of AI in this group. Anesthesiologists hold a range of opinions, 
      both positive and negative, regarding the application of AI in their field of 
      work. Survey-based studies do not always uncover the full breadth of nuance of 
      opinion amongst clinicians. Engagement with specific concerns, both technical and 
      ethical, will prove important as this technology moves from research to the 
      clinic.

TI  - Needs and Attitudes of Older Chronic Back Pain Patients towards a Wearable for 
      Ultrasound Biofeedback during Stabilization Exercises: A Qualitative Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20064927 [doi]
LID - 4927
AB  - Chronic back pain has a high prevalence, especially in older adults, and 
      seriously affects sufferers' quality of life. Segmental stabilization exercise 
      (SSE) is often used during physiotherapy to enhance core stability. The execution 
      of SSE requires the selective contraction of deep abdominal and back muscles. 
      Motor learning can be supported using ultrasound imaging as visual biofeedback. 
      ULTRAWEAR is a mobile ultrasound system that provides deep learning-based 
      biofeedback on SSE execution, which is currently under development. We 
      interviewed 15 older chronic back pain patients (CBPPs) to investigate their pain 
      management behavior, experience with SSE, as well as their needs and requirements 
      for ULTRAWEAR. We also gathered information about future-usage scenarios. CBPPs 
      reported a high willingness to use the system as a feedback tool both in 
      physiotherapeutic practices and at home. The automated detection and evaluation 
      of muscle contraction states was highlighted as a major benefit of the system 
      compared to the more subjective feedback provided by traditional methods such as 
      palpation. The system to be developed was perceived as a helpful solution to 
      support learning about SSE.

TI  - An Integrated System of Braden Scale and Random Forest Using Real-Time Diagnoses 
      to Predict When Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injuries (Bedsores) Occur.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20064911 [doi]
LID - 4911
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bedsores/Pressure Injuries (PIs) are the second most 
      common diagnosis in healthcare system billing records in the United States and 
      account for 60,000 deaths annually. Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injuries (HAPIs) 
      are one classification of PIs and indicate injuries that occurred while the 
      patient was cared for within the hospital. Until now, all studies have predicted 
      who will develop HAPI using classic machine algorithms, which provides incomplete 
      information for the clinical team. Knowing who will develop HAPI does not help 
      differentiate at which point those predicted patients will develop HAPIs; no 
      studies have investigated when HAPI develops for predicted at-risk patients. This 
      research aims to develop a hybrid system of Random Forest (RF) and Braden Scale 
      to predict HAPI time by considering the changes in patients' diagnoses from 
      admission until HAPI occurrence. METHODS: Real-time diagnoses and risk factors 
      were collected daily for 485 patients from admission until HAPI occurrence, which 
      resulted in 4619 records. Then for each record, HAPI time was calculated from the 
      day of diagnosis until HAPI occurrence. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) 
      selected the best factors among the 60 factors. The dataset was separated into 
      80% training (10-fold cross-validation) and 20% testing. Grid Search (GS) with RF 
      (GS-RF) was adopted to predict HAPI time using collected risk factors, including 
      Braden Scale. Then, the proposed model was compared with the seven most common 
      algorithms used to predict HAPI; each was replicated for 50 different 
      experiments. RESULTS: GS-RF achieved the best Area Under the Curve (AUC) (91.20 ± 
      0.26) and Geometric Mean (G-mean) (91.17 ± 0.26) compared to the seven 
      algorithms. RFE selected 43 factors. The most dominant interactable risk factors 
      in predicting HAPI time were visiting ICU during hospitalization, Braden 
      subscales, BMI, Stimuli Anesthesia, patient refusal to change position, and 
      another lab diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Identifying when the patient is likely to 
      develop HAPI can target early intervention when it is needed most and reduces 
      unnecessary burden on patients and care teams when patients are at lower risk, 
      which further individualizes the plan of care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the consistency of anesthesia 
      consciousness index (Ai) with that of bispectral index (BIS) in monitoring the 
      depth of anesthesia (DOA) during sevoflurane anesthesia, to reveal the optimal 
      cutoff values in different states of consciousness, and explore the stability of 
      DOA monitoring during intraoperative injurious stimulation. METHODS: We enrolled 
      145 patients (97 men and 48 women) from 10 medical centers. General anesthesia 
      was induced using intravenous anesthetics and maintained with sevoflurane. Ai and 
      BIS values were recorded. RESULTS: The mean difference between the Ai and BIS 
      was-0.1747 (95% confidence interval, -0.6660 to 0.3166; p = 0.4857). The 
      regression equation of Ai and BIS from the Deming regression analysis was 
      y = 5.6387 + 0.9067x (y is BIS, x is Ai), and the slope and intercept were 
      statistically significant. Meanwhile, the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      analysis of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, loss of consciousness, and 
      recovery of consciousness revealed that the accuracy of Ai and BIS were similar. 
      In addition, the optimal cutoff values of the different states of consciousness 
      were not sensitive to age, and both Ai and BIS had no correlation with 
      hemodynamics. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Ai and BIS show no systematic 
      deviation in readings with high consistency, similar accuracy, and good 
      stability; these insights provide more data for clinical application.

AB  - Telemedicine, telehealth, and E-health all offer significant benefits for pain 
      management and healthcare services by fostering the physician-patient 
      relationship in otherwise challenging circumstances. A critical component of 
      these artificial-intelligence-based health systems is the "agent-based system", 
      which is rapidly evolving as a means of resolving complicated or straightforward 
      problems. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are well-established modeling and 
      problem-solving modalities that model and solve real-world problems. MAS's core 
      concept is to foster communication and cooperation among agents, which are 
      broadly considered intelligent autonomous factors, to address diverse challenges. 
      MAS are used in various telecommunications applications, including the internet, 
      robotics, healthcare, and medicine. Furthermore, MAS and information technology 
      are utilized to enhance patient-centered palliative care. While telemedicine, 
      E-health, and MAS all play critical roles in managing chronic pain, the published 
      research on their use in treating chronic pain is currently limited. This paper 
      discusses why telemedicine, E-health, and MAS are the most critical novel 
      technologies for providing healthcare and managing chronic pain. This review also 
      provides context for identifying the advantages and disadvantages of each 
      application's features, which may serve as a useful tool for researchers.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on postoperative 
      sleep quality using polysomnography (PSG) to identify possible interventions for 
      postoperative sleep disturbances. METHODS: An electronic search of 
      PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science was conducted from 
      database inception to November 20, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on 
      the effect of DEX administration on postoperative sleep quality using PSG or its 
      derivatives were included. No language restrictions were applied. The sleep 
      efficiency index (SEI), arousal index (AI), percentages of stage N1, N2 and N3 of 
      non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were 
      measured in our meta-analysis. RESULTS: Five studies, involving 381 participants 
      were included. Administration of DEX significantly improved SEI, lowered AI, 
      decreased the duration of stage N1 sleep and increased the duration of stage N2 
      sleep compared to placebo groups. There were no significant differences in the 
      duration of stage N3 sleep and REM sleep. DEX administration lowered the 
      postoperative Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and improved the Ramsay sedation 
      score with no adverse effect on postoperative delirium (POD). However, high 
      heterogeneity was observed in most of the primary and secondary outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides support for the perioperative administration of 
      DEX to improve postoperative sleep quality. The optimal dosage and overall effect 
      of DEX on postoperative sleep quality require further investigation using 
      large-scale randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is widely used to assess brain function. However, most 
      preclinical CBF studies have been performed under anesthesia, which confounds 
      findings. High spatiotemporal-resolution CBF imaging of awake animals is 
      challenging due to motion artifacts and background noise, particularly for 
      Doppler-based flow imaging. Here, we report ultrahigh-resolution optical 
      coherence Doppler tomography (µODT) for 3D imaging of CBF velocity (CBFv) 
      dynamics in awake mice by developing self-supervised deep-learning for effective 
      image denoising and motion-artifact removal. We compare cortical CBFv in awake 
      vs. anesthetized mice and their dynamic responses in arteriolar, venular and 
      capillary networks to acute cocaine (1 mg/kg, i.v.), a highly addictive drug 
      associated with neurovascular toxicity. Compared with awake, isoflurane (2-2.5%) 
      induces vasodilation and increases CBFv within 2-4 min, whereas dexmedetomidine 
      (0.025 mg/kg, i.p.) does not change vessel diameters nor flow. Acute cocaine 
      decreases CBFv to the same extent in dexmedetomidine and awake states, whereas 
      decreases are larger under isoflurane, suggesting that isoflurane-induced 
      vasodilation might have facilitated detection of cocaine-induced 
      vasoconstriction. Awake mice after chronic cocaine show severe vasoconstriction, 
      CBFv decreases and vascular adaptations with extended diving arteriolar/venular 
      vessels that prioritize blood supply to deeper cortical capillaries. The 3D 
      imaging platform we present provides a powerful tool to study dynamic changes in 
      vessel diameters and morphology alongside CBFv networks in the brain of awake 
      animals that can advance our understanding of the effects of drugs and disease 
      conditions (ischemia, tumors, wound healing).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is a commonly used diagnostic tool 
      for surgical procedural selection in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but it is 
      expensive, subjective, and requires sedation. Here we present an initial 
      investigation of high-resolution pharyngeal manometry (HRM) for upper airway 
      phenotyping in OSA, developing a software system that reliably predicts 
      pharyngeal sites of collapse based solely on manometric recordings. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Prospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: An academic sleep medicine and 
      surgery practice. METHODS: Forty participants underwent simultaneous HRM and 
      DISE. A machine learning algorithm was constructed to estimate pharyngeal 
      level-specific severity of collapse, as determined by an expert DISE reviewer. 
      The primary outcome metrics for each level were model accuracy and F1-score, 
      which balances model precision against recall. RESULTS: During model training, 
      the average F1-score across all categories was 0.86, with an average weighted 
      accuracy of 0.91. Using a holdout test set of 9 participants, a K-nearest 
      neighbor model trained on 31 participants attained an average F1-score of 0.96 
      and an average accuracy of 0.97. The F1-score for prediction of complete 
      concentric palatal collapse was 0.86. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that HRM 
      may enable objective and dynamic mapping of the pharynx, opening new pathways 
      toward reliable and reproducible assessment of this complex anatomy in sleep.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods allow for automatic assessment of pain 
      intensity based on continuous monitoring and processing of subtle changes in 
      sensory signals, including facial expression, body movements, and crying 
      frequency. Currently, there is a large and growing need for expanding current 
      AI-based approaches to the assessment of postoperative pain in the neonatal 
      intensive care unit (NICU). In contrast to acute procedural pain in the clinic, 
      the NICU has neonates emerging from postoperative sedation, usually intubated, 
      and with variable energy reserves for manifesting forceful pain responses. Here, 
      we present a novel multi-modal approach designed, developed, and validated for 
      assessment of neonatal postoperative pain in the challenging NICU setting. Our 
      approach includes a robust network capable of efficient reconstruction of missing 
      modalities (e.g., obscured facial expression due to intubation) using an 
      unsupervised spatio-temporal feature learning with a generative model for 
      learning the joint features. Our approach generates the final pain score along 
      with the intensity using an attentional cross-modal feature fusion. Using 
      experimental dataset from postoperative neonates in the NICU, our pain assessment 
      approach achieves superior performance (AUC 0.906, accuracy 0.820) as compared to 
      the state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Logistic Regression and Machine Learning Models for Predicting Whether Intensive 
      Care Patients Who Are Alert and Without Delirium Remain As Such for at Least Two 
      More Days.
PG  - e34913
LID - 10.7759/cureus.34913 [doi]
LID - e34913
AB  - Background Some intensive care unit patients are alert and without delirium for 
      at least two consecutive days. These patients, like other critically ill 
      individuals, are at risk for dignity-related distress. An interval of at least 
      two days would provide for a palliative care multidisciplinary team to be 
      consulted in the late morning or afternoon of day one and visit the next day. An 
      assessment would include the administration of the validated Patient Dignity 
      Inventory in a reflective manner. To determine whether dignity-related distress 
      can be identified and treated during patients' intensive care unit stay, we 
      evaluated whether a substantive fraction of such patients (≥5%) have 
      a substantial (>90%) probability of remaining alert and without delirium in the 
      intensive care unit for at least four consecutive days. Methods The retrospective 
      cohort study used data from one large teaching hospital in the United States of 
      America, from 2012 to June 2022. The inclusion criteria were: a) adults, 
      b) present in an intensive care unit at 12 PM one day and continually so for the 
      next 48 hours, c) during those two days had every Riker sedation-agitation scale 
      score "4, calm and cooperative," and d) during those two days had all Confusion 
      Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) scores negative (i.e., no 
      delirium) and all Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOS) scores less than 
      three (i.e., no delirium). Results Among the 10,314 patients alert and without 
      delirium in an intensive care unit over two-day periods that included 
      three successive 12 PMs, 3,826 (37%) maintained this status for at least two 
      successive 12 PMs. Six patient characteristics (e.g., hemodynamic infusion or 
      ventilatory support) had value in predicting those 37% of patients. However, 
      logistic regression and classification models each predicted a few (≈0.2%) 
      patients with >90% probability of maintaining these criteria. Forecasts were 
      inaccurate for nearly all patients remaining alert and without delirium in the 
      intensive care unit (≈37%) because the models predicted no patient alert, without 
      delirium, and in the intensive care unit for two days would remain so for at 
      least four days. That ≈63% accuracy was improved upon by random forest machine 
      learning, but only with ≈3% improvement. Conclusion Although many intensive care 
      unit patients remain alert and without delirium for several consecutive days, 
      each patient has a high daily probability of intensive care unit discharge or 
      deterioration in medical condition. Therefore, the results of our prediction 
      modeling show that care models for the assessment and treatment of patients with 
      intensive care unit-associated dignity-related distress should not rely solely on 
      the intensive care unit team but instead should be taken from the perspective 
      of the entire hospitalization.

TI  - Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery Using Interpretable 
      Machine Learning.
PG  - e127140
LID - 10.5812/aapm-127140 [doi]
LID - e127140
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complication that occurs for various 
      reasons after surgery, especially cardiac surgery. This complication can lead to 
      a prolonged treatment process, increased costs, and sometimes death. Prediction 
      of postoperative AKI can help anesthesiologists to implement preventive and early 
      treatment strategies to reduce the risk of AKI. OBJECTIVES: This study tries to 
      predict postoperative AKI using interpretable machine learning models. METHODS: 
      For this study, the information of 1435 patients was collected from multiple 
      centers. The gathered data are in six categories: demographic characteristics and 
      type of surgery, past medical history (PMH), drug history (DH), laboratory 
      information, anesthesia and surgery information, and postoperative variables. 
      Machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), multilayer 
      perceptron (MLP), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), logistic regression, 
      XGBoost, and AdaBoost, were used to predict postoperative AKI. Local 
      interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and the Shapley methods were 
      then leveraged to check the interpretability of models. RESULTS: Comparing the 
      area under the curves (AUCs) obtained for different machine learning models show 
      that the RF and XGBoost methods with values of 0.81 and 0.80 best predict 
      postoperative AKI. The interpretations obtained for the machine learning models 
      show that creatinine (Cr), cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB time), blood sugar 
      (BS), and albumin (Alb) have the most significant impact on predictions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The treatment team can be informed about the possibility of 
      postoperative AKI before cardiac surgery using machine learning models such as RF 
      and XGBoost and adjust the treatment procedure accordingly. Interpretability of 
      predictions for each patient ensures the validity of obtained predictions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of postpartum hemorrhage risk factors by healthcare 
      providers during pregnancy and the postpartum period may allow healthcare 
      providers to act to prevent it. Developing a prediction model that incorporates 
      several risk factors and accurately calculates the overall risk for postpartum 
      hemorrhage is necessary. OBJECTIVE: This study used a traditional analytical 
      approach and a machine learning model to predict postpartum hemorrhage. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Women who gave birth at the Khaleej-e-Fars Hospital in Bandar Abbas, 
      Iran, were evaluated retrospectively between January 1, 2020, and January 1, 
      2022. These pregnant women were divided into 2 groups, namely those who had 
      postpartum hemorrhage and those who did not. We used 2 approaches for the 
      analysis. At the first level, we used the traditional analysis methods. 
      Demographic factors, maternal comorbidities, and obstetrical factors were 
      compared between the 2 groups. A bivariate logistic regression analysis of the 
      risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage was done to estimate the crude odds ratios 
      and their 95% confidence intervals. In the second level, we used machine learning 
      approaches to predict postpartum hemorrhage. RESULTS: Of the 8888 deliveries, we 
      identified 163 women with recorded postpartum hemorrhage, giving a frequency of 
      1.8%. According to a traditional analysis, factors associated with an increased 
      risk for postpartum hemorrhage in a bivariate logistic regression analysis were 
      living in a rural area (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.98); 
      primiparity (odds ratio, 3.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.90-4.75); mild to 
      moderate anemia (odds ratio, 5.94; 95% confidence interval 2.81-8.34); severe 
      anemia (odds ratio, 6.01; 95% confidence interval 3.89-11.09); abnormal 
      placentation (odds ratio, 7.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.81-17.34); fetal 
      macrosomia (odds ratio, 8.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-14.47); shoulder 
      dystocia (odds ratio, 7.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-13.99); vacuum delivery 
      (odds ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-5.98); cesarean delivery (odds 
      ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.79); and general anesthesia during 
      cesarean delivery (odds ratio, 7.66; 95 % confidence interval, 3.11-9.36). 
      According to machine learning analysis, the top 5 algorithms were XGBoost 
      regression (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 99%), 
      XGBoost classification (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 
      98%), LightGBM (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 94%), 
      random forest regression (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      of 86%), and linear regression (area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve of 78%). However, after considering all performance parameters, the XGBoost 
      classification was found to be the best model to predict postpartum hemorrhage. 
      The importance of the variables in the linear regression model, similar to 
      traditional analysis methods, revealed that macrosomia, general anesthesia, 
      anemia, shoulder dystocia, and abnormal placentation were considered to be 
      weighted factors, whereas XGBoost classification considered living residency, 
      parity, cesarean delivery, education, and induced labor to be weighted factors. 
      CONCLUSION: Risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage can be identified using 
      traditional statistical analysis and a machine learning model. Machine learning 
      models were a credible approach for improving postpartum hemorrhage prediction 
      with high accuracy. More research should be conducted to analyze appropriate 
      variables and prepare big data to determine the best model.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop prediction models for chronic postsurgical 
      pain (CPSP) after breast cancer surgery using machine learning approaches and 
      evaluate their performance. METHODS: The study was a secondary analysis based on 
      a high-quality dataset from a randomized controlled trial (NCT00418457), 
      including patients with primary breast cancer undergoing mastectomy. The primary 
      outcome was CPSP at 12 months after surgery, defined as modified Brief Pain 
      Inventory > 0. The dataset was randomly split into a training dataset (90%) and a 
      testing dataset (10%). Variables were selected using recursive feature 
      elimination combined with clinical experience, and potential predictors were then 
      incorporated into three machine learning models, including random forest, 
      gradient boosting decision tree and extreme gradient boosting models for outcome 
      prediction, as well as logistic regression. The performances of these four models 
      were tested and compared. RESULTS: 1152 patients were finally included, of which 
      22.1% developed CPSP at 12 months after breast cancer surgery. The 6 leading 
      predictors were higher numerical rating scale within 2 days after surgery, 
      post-menopausal status, urban medical insurance, history of at least one 
      operation, under fentanyl with sevoflurane general anesthesia, and received 
      axillary lymph node dissection. Compared with the multivariable logistic 
      regression model, machine learning models showed better specificity, positive 
      likelihood ratio and positive predictive value, helping to identify high-risk 
      patients more accurately and create opportunities for early clinical 
      intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Our study developed prediction models for CPSP after 
      breast cancer surgery based on machine learning approaches, which may help to 
      identify high-risk patients and improve patients' management after breast cancer.

TI  - The Lifetime History of the First Italian Public Extra-Corporeal Shock Wave 
      Lithotripsy (ESWL) Lithotripter as a Mirror of the Evolution of Endourology over 
      the Last Decade.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20054127 [doi]
LID - 4127
AB  - Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the only non-invasive treatment 
      for kidney stones. It does not require an operating room, anesthesia, or hospital 
      stay. Its role evolved over the years and nowadays ESWL is slowly disappearing 
      from many stone centers and urologic departments. We present the history and the 
      role of ESWL treatment since its birth in 1959 and its development through the 
      following years. We also present details of its application and impact on the 
      first Italian stone center in 1985. ESWL has had different roles over the 
      centuries: in the early years it was a great alternative to open surgery and 
      percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL), then it had its decline with the 
      introduction of the miniscopes. Currently, although ESWL is not considered a 
      treatment of excellence, newer models are emerging. With the application of new 
      technologies and artificial intelligence, this technique can become a good option 
      alongside endourologic treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ASA physical status (ASA-PS) is determined by an anesthesia 
      provider or surgeon to communicate co-morbidities relevant to perioperative risk. 
      Assigning an ASA-PS is a clinical decision and there is substantial 
      provider-dependent variability. We developed and externally validated a machine 
      learning-derived algorithm to determine ASA-PS (ML-PS) based on data available in 
      the medical record. DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter hospital registry study. 
      SETTING: University-affiliated hospital networks. PATIENTS: Patients who received 
      anesthesia at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA, training 
      [n = 361,602] and internal validation cohorts [n = 90,400]) and Montefiore 
      Medical Center (Bronx, NY, external validation cohort [n = 254,412]). 
      MEASUREMENTS: The ML-PS was created using a supervised random forest model with 
      35 preoperatively available variables. Its predictive ability for 30-day 
      mortality, postoperative ICU admission, and adverse discharge were determined by 
      logistic regression. MAIN RESULTS: The anesthesiologist ASA-PS and ML-PS were in 
      agreement in 57.2% of the cases (moderate inter-rater agreement). Compared with 
      anesthesiologist rating, ML-PS assigned more patients into extreme ASA-PS (I and 
      IV), (p < 0.01), and less patients in ASA II and III (p < 0.01). ML-PS and 
      anesthesiologist ASA-PS had excellent predictive values for 30-day mortality, and 
      good predictive values for postoperative ICU admission and adverse discharge. 
      Among the 3594 patients who died within 30 days after surgery, net 
      reclassification improvement analysis revealed that using the ML-PS, 1281 (35.6%) 
      patients were reclassified into the higher clinical risk category compared with 
      anesthesiologist rating. However, in a subgroup of multiple co-morbidity 
      patients, anesthesiologist ASA-PS had a better predictive accuracy than ML-PS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We created and validated a machine learning physical status based on 
      preoperatively available data. The ability to identify patients at high risk 
      early in the preoperative process independent of the provider's decision is a 
      part of the process we use to standardize the stratified preoperative evaluation 
      of patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery.

PG  - 309-316

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individualized medicine uses data on biological characteristics of 
      individual patients in order to tailor treatment planning to their unique 
      constitution. With respect to the practice of anesthesiology and intensive care 
      medicine, it bears the potential to systematize the often complex medical care of 
      critically ill patients and to improve outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      narrative review is to provide an overview of the possible applications of the 
      principles of individualized medicine in anesthesiology and intensive care 
      medicine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on a search in MEDLINE, CENTRAL and Google 
      Scholar, the results of previous studies and systematic reviews are narratively 
      synthesized and the implications for the scientific and clinical practice are 
      presented. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There are possibilities for individualization 
      and an increase in precision of patient care in most if not all problems in 
      anesthesiology and symptoms in intensive medical care. Even now, all practicing 
      physicians can initiate measures to individualize treatment at different 
      timepoints throughout the course of treatment. Individualized medicine can 
      supplement and be integrated into protocols. Plans for future applications of 
      individualized medicine interventions should consider the feasibility in 
      a real-world setting. Clinical studies should contain process evaluations in 
      order to create ideal preconditions for a successful implementation. Quality 
      management, audits and feedback should become a standard procedure to ensure 
      sustainability. In the long run, individualization of care, especially in the 
      critically ill, should be enshrined in guidelines and become an integral part of 
      clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reducing the duration of intraoperative hypoxemia in pediatric 
      patients by means of rapid detection and early intervention is considered crucial 
      by clinicians. We aimed to develop and validate a machine learning model that can 
      predict intraoperative hypoxemia events 1 min ahead in children undergoing 
      general anesthesia. METHODS: This retrospective study used prospectively 
      collected intraoperative vital signs and parameters from the anesthesia 
      ventilator machine extracted every 2 s in pediatric patients undergoing surgery 
      under general anesthesia between January 2019 and October 2020 in a tertiary 
      academic hospital. Intraoperative hypoxemia was defined as oxygen saturation <95% 
      at any point during surgery. Three common machine learning techniques were 
      employed to develop models using the training dataset: gradient-boosting machine 
      (GBM), long short-term memory (LSTM), and transformer. The performances of the 
      models were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristics 
      curve using randomly assigned internal testing dataset. We also validated the 
      developed models using temporal holdout dataset. Pediatric patient surgery cases 
      between November 2020 and January 2021 were used. The performances of the models 
      were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (AUROC). RESULTS: In total, 1,540 (11.73%) patients with intraoperative hypoxemia 
      out of 13,130 patients' records with 2,367 episodes were included for developing 
      the model dataset. After model development, 200 (13.25%) of the 1,510 patients' 
      records with 289 episodes were used for holdout validation. Among the models 
      developed, the GBM had the highest AUROC of 0.904 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.902 to 0.906), which was significantly higher than that of the LSTM (0.843, 95% 
      CI 0.840 to 0.846 P < .001) and the transformer model (0.885, 95% CI, 
      0.882-0.887, P < .001). In holdout validation, GBM also demonstrated best 
      performance with an AUROC of 0.939 (95% CI 0.936 to 0.941) which was better than 
      LSTM (0.904, 95% CI 0.900 to 0.907, P < .001) and the transformer model (0.929, 
      95% CI 0.926 to 0.932, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models can be 
      used to predict upcoming intraoperative hypoxemia in real-time based on the 
      biosignals acquired by patient monitors, which can be useful for clinicians for 
      prediction and proactive treatment of hypoxemia in an intraoperative setting.

AB  - PURPOSE: Predict nonhome discharge (NHD) following elective anterior cervical 
      discectomy and fusion (ACDF) using an explainable machine learning model. 
      METHODS: 2227 patients undergoing elective ACDF from 2008 to 2019 were identified 
      from a single institutional database. A machine learning model was trained on 
      preoperative variables, including demographics, comorbidity indices, and levels 
      fused. The validation technique was repeated stratified K-Fold cross validation 
      with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) statistic as the 
      performance metric. Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were calculated to 
      provide further explainability regarding the model's decision making. RESULTS: 
      The preoperative model performed with an AUROC of 0.83 ± 0.05. SHAP scores 
      revealed the most pertinent risk factors to be age, medicare insurance, and 
      American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score. Interaction analysis demonstrated 
      that female patients over 65 with greater fusion levels were more likely to 
      undergo NHD. Likewise, ASA demonstrated positive interaction effects with female 
      sex, levels fused and BMI. CONCLUSION: We validated an explainable machine 
      learning model for the prediction of NHD using common preoperative variables. 
      Adding transparency is a key step towards clinical application because it 
      demonstrates that our model's "thinking" aligns with clinical reasoning. 
      Interactive analysis demonstrated that those of age over 65, female sex, higher 
      ASA score, and greater fusion levels were more predisposed to NHD. Age and ASA 
      score were similar in their predictive ability. Machine learning may be used to 
      predict NHD, and can assist surgeons with patient counseling or early discharge 
      planning.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The current service evaluation aimed to explore the impact of 
      COVID-19 on patients' experiences of pain management therapy. The study examined 
      the barriers and benefits of the move from face-to-face to eHealth methods of 
      delivery. DESIGN: A service evaluation was conducted in an outpatient pain clinic 
      in an NHS Trust in the East of England. A qualitative approach was taken using 
      semi-structured interviews. METHODS: Participants were recruited through a health 
      psychology service operating as part of a multidisciplinary pain management 
      clinic. Six patients, aged 39-67, were interviewed one-to-one using the online 
      platform Zoom(TM). During COVID-19, participants had individual or group pain 
      management therapy via telephone or video conferencing. All interviews were 
      transcribed using Otter.ai(TM) and thematic analysis was performed. The study was 
      approved by internal clinical governance for service evaluations and the authors 
      adhered to the BPS Code of Human Research Ethics. RESULTS: Three key themes 
      emerged from the analysis; Benefits Aside From Pain Relief, Limited Their 
      Experience, and COVID- 19: A D ouble-Edged Sword. CONCLUSION: Findings suggested 
      patients were able to benefit from pain management therapy despite the impact of 
      COVID-19 on daily routines and pain experience. Adopting eHealth methods during 
      the pandemic was an effective means of accessing pain management therapy. These 
      methods allowed patients to continue to benefit from peer support and learn about 
      skills and resources regarding self-management, whilst also improving 
      accessibility for those with chronic pain. Yet, these methods are not without 
      their limitations. Technical issues and difficulties creating therapeutic 
      connections with psychologists limited patients' experience of pain management 
      therapy.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is due to the 
      significant progress in big data, databases, algorithms, and computing power, and 
      medical research is a vital application direction of AI. The integrated 
      development of AI and medicine has improved medical technology, and the 
      efficiency of medical services and equipment has enabled doctors to better serve 
      patients. The tasks and characteristics of the anesthesia discipline also make AI 
      necessary for its development, and AI has also been initially applied in 
      different fields of anesthesia. Our review aims to clarify the current situation 
      and challenges of AI application in anesthesiology to provide clinical references 
      and guide the future development of AI in anesthesiology. This review summarizes 
      progress in the application of AI in perioperative risk assessment and 
      prediction, deep monitoring and regulation of anesthesia, essential anesthesia 
      skills operation, automatic drug administration systems, and teaching and 
      training in anesthesia. Also discussed herein are the accompanying risks and 
      challenges of applying AI in anesthesia: patient privacy and information 
      security, data sources, and ethical issues, lack of capital and talent, and the 
      "black box" phenomenon.

TI  - Difficult Spinal-Arachnoid Puncture (DSP) Score: Development and Performance 
      Analysis.
PG  - e33760
LID - 10.7759/cureus.33760 [doi]
LID - e33760
AB  - BACKGROUND: Difficult and traumatic neuraxial blocks and procedures are not 
      uncommon. Although score-based prediction has been attempted, the practical 
      application of those has remained limited for various reasons. The aim of this 
      study was to develop a clinical scoring system from the strong predictors of 
      failed spinal-arachnoid puncture procedures assessed previously using artificial 
      neural network (ANN) analysis and analyze the score's performance on the index 
      cohort. METHODS: The present study is based on the ANN model analyzing 300 
      spinal-arachnoid punctures (index cohort) performed in an academic institute in 
      India. For the development of the score, i.e., Difficult Spinal-Arachnoid 
      Puncture (DSP) Score, the coefficient estimates of the input variables, which 
      showed a Pr(>|z|) value of <0.01, were considered. The resultant DSP Score was 
      then applied to the index cohort for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      analysis, Youden's J point determination for best sensitivity and specificity, 
      and diagnostic statistical analysis for the cut-off value for predicting the 
      difficulty. RESULTS: A DSP Score incorporating spine grades, performers' 
      experience, and positioning difficulty was developed; the minimum and maximum 
      scores were 0 and 7, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the DSP Score 
      was 0.858 (95% confidence interval 0.811-0.905), Youden's J point for cut-off was 
      at 2, which showed a specificity and sensitivity of 98.15% and 56.5%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: The ANN model-based DSP Score developed for predicting 
      the difficult spinal-arachnoid puncture procedure showed an excellent area under 
      the ROC curve. At the cut-off value 2, the score had a sensitivity plus 
      specificity of approximately 155%, indicating that the tool can be useful as a 
      diagnostic (predictive) tool in clinical practice.

TI  - Repurposing ketamine to treat cocaine use disorder: integration of artificial 
      intelligence-based prediction, expert evaluation, clinical corroboration and 
      mechanism of action analyses.
PG  - 1307-1319
LID - 10.1111/add.16168 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a significant public health 
      issue for which there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
      medication. Drug repurposing looks for new cost-effective uses of approved drugs. 
      This study presents an integrated strategy to identify repurposed FDA-approved 
      drugs for CUD treatment. DESIGN: Our drug repurposing strategy combines 
      artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug prediction, expert panel review, clinical 
      corroboration and mechanisms of action analysis being implemented in the National 
      Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Based on AI-based prediction 
      and expert knowledge, ketamine was ranked as the top candidate for clinical 
      corroboration via electronic health record (EHR) evaluation of CUD patient 
      cohorts prescribed ketamine for anesthesia or depression compared with matched 
      controls who received non-ketamine anesthesia or antidepressants/midazolam. 
      Genetic and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to understand ketamine's 
      potential mechanisms of action in the context of CUD. SETTING: The study utilized 
      TriNetX to access EHRs from more than 90 million patients world-wide. Genetic- 
      and functional-level analyses used DisGeNet, Search Tool for Interactions of 
      Chemicals and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases. PARTICIPANTS: A 
      total of 7742 CUD patients who received anesthesia (3871 ketamine-exposed and 
      3871 anesthetic-controlled) and 7910 CUD patients with depression (3955 
      ketamine-exposed and 3955 antidepressant-controlled) were identified after 
      propensity score-matching. MEASUREMENTS: EHR analysis outcome was a CUD remission 
      diagnosis within 1 year of drug prescription. FINDINGS: Patients with CUD 
      prescribed ketamine for anesthesia displayed a significantly higher rate of CUD 
      remission compared with matched individuals prescribed other anesthetics [hazard 
      ratio (HR) = 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.42-2.78]. Similarly, CUD 
      patients prescribed ketamine for depression evidenced a significantly higher CUD 
      remission ratio compared with matched patients prescribed antidepressants or 
      midazolam (HR = 4.39, 95% CI = 2.89-6.68). The mechanism of action analysis 
      revealed that ketamine directly targets multiple CUD-associated genes (BDNF, 
      CNR1, DRD2, GABRA2, GABRB3, GAD1, OPRK1, OPRM1, SLC6A3, SLC6A4) and pathways 
      implicated in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cAMP signaling and cocaine 
      abuse/dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine appears to be a potential repurposed drug 
      for treatment of cocaine use disorder.

PG  - 624-633
LID - 10.1080/07853890.2023.2179104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative sepsis is one of the main causes of mortality after 
      liver transplantation (LT). Our study aimed to develop and validate a predictive 
      model for postoperative sepsis within 7 d in LT recipients using machine learning 
      (ML) technology. METHODS: Data of 786 patients received LT from January 2015 to 
      January 2020 was retrospectively extracted from the big data platform of Third 
      Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Seven ML models were developed to 
      predict postoperative sepsis. The area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC), 
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and f1-score were evaluated as the model 
      performances. The model with the best performance was validated in an independent 
      dataset involving 118 adult LT cases from February 2020 to April 2021. The 
      postoperative sepsis-associated outcomes were also explored in the study. 
      RESULTS: After excluding 109 patients according to the exclusion criteria, 677 
      patients underwent LT were finally included in the analysis. Among them, 216 
      (31.9%) were diagnosed with sepsis after LT, which were related to more 
      perioperative complications, increased postoperative hospital stay and mortality 
      after LT (all p < .05). Our results revealed that a larger volume of red blood 
      cell infusion, ascitic removal, blood loss and gastric drainage, less volume of 
      crystalloid infusion and urine, longer anesthesia time, higher level of 
      preoperative TBIL were the top 8 important variables contributing to the 
      prediction of post-LT sepsis. The Random Forest Classifier (RF) model showed the 
      best overall performance to predict sepsis after LT among the seven ML models 
      developed in the study, with an AUC of 0.731, an accuracy of 71.6%, the 
      sensitivity of 62.1%, and specificity of 76.1% in the internal validation set, 
      and a comparable AUC of 0.755 in the external validation set. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study enrolled eight pre- and intra-operative variables to develop an RF-based 
      predictive model of post-LT sepsis to assist clinical decision-making procedure.

TI  - Patient-Reported Data Augment Prediction Models of Persistent Opioid Use after 
      Elective Upper Extremity Surgery.
PG  - 358e-366e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010297 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioids play a role in pain management after surgery, but prolonged 
      use contributes to developing opioid use disorder. Identifying patients at risk 
      of prolonged use is critical for deploying interventions that reduce or avoid 
      opioids; however, available predictive models do not incorporate patient-reported 
      data (PRD), and it remains unclear whether PRD can predict postoperative use 
      behavior. The authors used a machine learning approach leveraging preoperative 
      PRD and electronic health record data to predict persistent opioid use after 
      upper extremity surgery. METHODS: Included patients underwent upper extremity 
      surgery, completed preoperative PRD questionnaires, and were prescribed opioids 
      after surgery. The authors trained models using a 2018 cohort and tested in a 
      2019 cohort. Opioid use was determined by patient report and filled prescriptions 
      up to 6 months after surgery. The authors assessed model performance using area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic, sensitivity, specificity, and Brier 
      score. RESULTS: Among 1656 patients, 19% still used opioids at 6 weeks, 11% at 3 
      months, and 9% at 6 months. The XGBoost model trained on PRD plus electronic 
      health record data achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic 0.73 
      at 6 months. Factors predictive of prolonged opioid use included income; 
      education; tobacco, drug, or alcohol abuse; cancer; depression; and race. 
      Protective factors included preoperative Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System Global Physical Health and Upper Extremity scores. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This opioid use prediction model using preintervention data had good 
      discriminative performance. PRD variables augmented electronic health 
      record-based machine learning algorithms in predicting postsurgical use behaviors 
      and were some of the strongest predictors. PRD should be used in future efforts 
      to guide proper opioid stewardship. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Risk, 
      III.

TI  - Development of a Machine-Learning Model for Prediction of Extubation Failure in 
      Patients with Difficult Airways after General Anesthesia of Head, Neck, and 
      Maxillofacial Surgeries.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12031066 [doi]
LID - 1066
AB  - (1) Background: Extubation failure after general anesthesia is significantly 
      associated with morbidity and mortality. The risk of a difficult airway after the 
      general anesthesia of head, neck, and maxillofacial surgeries is significantly 
      higher than that after general surgery, increasing the incidence of extubation 
      failure. This study aimed to develop a multivariable prediction model based on a 
      supervised machine-learning algorithm to predict extubation failure in adult 
      patients after head, neck, and maxillofacial surgeries. (2) Methods: A 
      single-center retrospective study was conducted in adult patients who underwent 
      head, neck, and maxillofacial general anesthesia between July 2015 and July 2022 
      at the Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital. The primary outcome was extubation 
      failure after general anesthesia. The dataset was divided into training (70%) and 
      final test sets (30%). A five-fold cross-validation was conducted in the training 
      set to reduce bias caused by the randomly divided dataset. Clinical data related 
      to extubation failure were collected and a stepwise logistic regression was 
      performed to screen out the key features. Six machine-learning methods were 
      introduced for modeling, including random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), 
      logistic regression (LOG), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient 
      boosting (XGB), and optical gradient boosting machine (GBM). The best performance 
      model in the first cross-validation dataset was further optimized and the final 
      performance was assessed using the final test set. (3) Results: In total, 89,279 
      patients over seven years were reviewed. Extubation failure occurred in 77 
      patients. Next, 186 patients with a successful extubation were screened as the 
      control group according to the surgery type for patients with extubation failure. 
      Based on the stepwise regression, seven variables were screened for subsequent 
      analysis. After training, SVM and LOG models showed better prediction ability. In 
      the k-fold dataset, the area under the curve using SVM and LOG were 0.74 (95% 
      confidence interval, 0.55-0.93) and 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.82), 
      respectively, in the k-fold dataset. (4) Conclusion: Applying our 
      machine-learning model to predict extubation failure after general anesthesia in 
      clinical practice might help to reduce morbidity and mortality of patients with 
      difficult airways after head, neck, and maxillofacial surgeries.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The automatic assessment of pain is vital in designing 
      optimal pain management interventions focused on reducing suffering and 
      preventing the functional decline of patients. In recent years, there has been a 
      surge in the adoption of deep learning algorithms by researchers attempting to 
      encode the multidimensional nature of pain into meaningful features. This 
      systematic review aims to discuss the models, the methods, and the types of data 
      employed in establishing the foundation of a deep learning-based automatic pain 
      assessment system. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted by identifying 
      original studies searching digital libraries, namely Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM 
      Digital Library. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to retrieve and 
      select those of interest, published until December 2021. RESULTS: A total of one 
      hundred and ten publications were identified and categorized by the number of 
      information channels used (unimodal versus multimodal approaches) and whether the 
      temporal dimension was also used. CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrates the 
      importance of multimodal approaches for automatic pain estimation, especially in 
      clinical settings, and also reveals that significant improvements are observed 
      when the temporal exploitation of modalities is included. It provides suggestions 
      regarding better-performing deep architectures and learning methods. Also, it 
      provides suggestions for adopting robust evaluation protocols and interpretation 
      methods to provide objective and comprehensible results. Furthermore, the review 
      presents the limitations of the available pain databases for optimally supporting 
      deep learning model development, validation, and application as decision-support 
      tools in real-life scenarios.

TI  - A Neural Network Model Using Pain Score Patterns to Predict the Need for 
      Outpatient Opioid Refills Following Ambulatory Surgery: Algorithm Development and 
      Validation.
PG  - e40455
LID - 10.2196/40455 [doi]
LID - e40455
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansion of clinical guidance tools is crucial to identify patients 
      at risk of requiring an opioid refill after outpatient surgery. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objective of this study was to develop machine learning algorithms incorporating 
      pain and opioid features to predict the need for outpatient opioid refills 
      following ambulatory surgery. METHODS: Neural networks, regression, random 
      forest, and a support vector machine were used to evaluate the data set. For each 
      model, oversampling and undersampling techniques were implemented to balance the 
      data set. Hyperparameter tuning based on k-fold cross-validation was performed, 
      and feature importance was ranked based on a Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) 
      explainer model. To assess performance, we calculated the average area under the 
      receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), F1-score, sensitivity, and 
      specificity for each model. RESULTS: There were 1333 patients, of whom 144 
      (10.8%) refilled their opioid prescription within 2 weeks after outpatient 
      surgery. The average AUC calculated from k-fold cross-validation was 0.71 for the 
      neural network model. When the model was validated on the test set, the AUC was 
      0.75. The features with the highest impact on model output were performance of a 
      regional nerve block, postanesthesia care unit maximum pain score, postanesthesia 
      care unit median pain score, active smoking history, and total perioperative 
      opioid consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Applying machine learning algorithms allows 
      providers to better predict outcomes that require specialized health care 
      resources such as transitional pain clinics. This model can aid as a clinical 
      decision support for early identification of at-risk patients who may benefit 
      from transitional pain clinic care perioperatively in ambulatory surgery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use the low-cost anesthesia monitor for realizing anesthesia depth 
      monitoring, effectively assist anesthesiologists in diagnosis and reduce the cost 
      of anesthesia operation. METHODS: Propose a monitoring method of anesthesia depth 
      based on artificial intelligence. The monitoring method is designed based on 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) and long and short-term memory (LSTM) network. 
      The input data of the model include electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse wave 
      photoplethysmography (PPG) recorded in the anesthesia monitor, as well as heart 
      rate variability (HRV) calculated from ECG, The output of the model is in three 
      states of anesthesia induction, anesthesia maintenance and anesthesia awakening. 
      RESULTS: The accuracy of anesthesia depth monitoring model under transfer 
      learning is 94.1%, which is better than all comparison methods. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      accuracy of this study meets the needs of perioperative anesthesia depth 
      monitoring and the study reduces the operation cost.

TI  - Blood pressure monitoring during anesthesia induction using PPG morphology 
      features and machine learning.

AB  - Blood pressure (BP) is a crucial biomarker giving valuable information regarding 
      cardiovascular diseases but requires accurate continuous monitoring to maximize 
      its value. In the effort of developing non-invasive, non-occlusive and continuous 
      BP monitoring devices, photoplethysmography (PPG) has recently gained interest. 
      Researchers have attempted to estimate BP based on the analysis of PPG waveform 
      morphology, with promising results, yet often validated on a small number of 
      subjects with moderate BP variations. This work presents an accurate BP estimator 
      based on PPG morphology features. The method first uses a clinically-validated 
      algorithm (oBPM®) to perform signal preprocessing and extraction of physiological 
      features. A subset of features that best reflects BP changes is automatically 
      identified by Lasso regression, and a feature relevance analysis is conducted. 
      Three machine learning (ML) methods are then investigated to translate this 
      subset of features into systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimates; 
      namely Lasso regression, support vector regression and Gaussian process 
      regression. The accuracy of absolute BP estimates and trending ability are 
      evaluated. Such an approach considerably improves the performance for SBP 
      estimation over previous oBPM® technology, with a reduction in the standard 
      deviation of the error of over 20%. Furthermore, rapid BP changes assessed by the 
      PPG-based approach demonstrates concordance rate over 99% with the invasive 
      reference. Altogether, the results confirm that PPG morphology features can be 
      combined with ML methods to accurately track BP variations generated during 
      anesthesia induction. They also reinforce the importance of adding a calibration 
      measure to obtain an absolute BP estimate.

TI  - Detection of Motor Cerebral Activity After Median Nerve Stimulation During 
      General Anesthesia (STIM-MOTANA): Protocol for a Prospective Interventional 
      Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accidental awareness during general anesthesia (AAGA) is defined as 
      an unexpected awareness of the patient during general anesthesia. This phenomenon 
      occurs in 1%-2% of high-risk practice patients and can cause physical suffering 
      and psychological after-effects, called posttraumatic stress disorder. In fact, 
      no monitoring techniques are satisfactory enough to effectively prevent AAGA; 
      therefore, new alternatives are needed. Because the first reflex for a patient 
      during an AAGA is to move, but cannot do so because of the neuromuscular 
      blockers, we believe that it is possible to design a brain-computer interface 
      (BCI) based on the detection of movement intention to warn the anesthetist. To do 
      this, we propose to describe and detect the changes in terms of motor cortex 
      oscillations during general anesthesia with propofol, while a median nerve 
      stimulation is performed. We believe that our results could enable the design of 
      a BCI based on median nerve stimulation, which could prevent AAGA. OBJECTIVE: To 
      our knowledge, no published studies have investigated the detection of 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in relation to peripheral nerve 
      stimulation over the sensorimotor cortex during general anesthesia. The main 
      objective of this study is to describe the changes in terms of event-related 
      desynchronization and event-related synchronization modulations, in the EEG 
      signal over the motor cortex during general anesthesia with propofol while a 
      median nerve stimulation is performed. METHODS: STIM-MOTANA is an interventional 
      and prospective study conducted with patients scheduled for surgery under general 
      anesthesia, involving EEG measurements and median nerve stimulation at two 
      different times: (1) when the patient is awake before surgery (2) and under 
      general anesthesia. A total of 30 patients will receive surgery under complete 
      intravenous anesthesia with a target-controlled infusion pump of propofol. 
      RESULTS: The changes in event-related desynchronization and event-related 
      synchronization during median nerve stimulation according to the various propofol 
      concentrations for 30 patients will be analyzed. In addition, we will apply 4 
      different offline machine learning algorithms to detect the median nerve 
      stimulation at the cerebral level. Recruitment began in December 2022. Data 
      collection is expected to conclude in June 2024. CONCLUSIONS: STIM-MOTANA will be 
      the first protocol to investigate median nerve stimulation cerebral motor effect 
      during general anesthesia for the detection of intraoperative awareness. Based on 
      strong practical and theoretical scientific reasoning from our previous studies, 
      our innovative median nerve stimulation-based BCI would provide a way to detect 
      intraoperative awareness during general anesthesia. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

      approach.
PG  - e24-e30
LID - 10.37765/ajmc.2023.89310 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We used electronic health record (EHR)-based raw audit logs to 
      classify the work settings of anesthesiology physicians providing care in both 
      surgical intensive care units (ICUs) and operating rooms. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Observational study. METHODS: Attending anesthesiologists who worked at least 1 
      shift in 1 of 4 surgical ICUs in calendar year 2019 were included. Time-stamped 
      EHR-based audit log events for each week were used to create event frequencies 
      and represented as a term frequency-inverse document frequency matrix. Primary 
      classification outcome of interest was a physician's clinical work setting. 
      Performance of multiple supervised machine learning classifiers were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: A total of 24 attending physicians were included; physicians performed a 
      median (IQR) of 2545 (906-5071) EHR-based actions per week and worked a median 
      (IQR) of 5 (3-7) weeks in a surgical ICU. A random forest classifier yielded the 
      best discriminative performance (mean [SD] area under receiver operating 
      characteristic curve, 0.88 [0.05]; mean [SD] area under precision-recall curve, 
      0.72 [0.13]). Model explanations illustrated that clinical activities related to 
      signing of clinical notes, printing handoff data, and updating diagnosis 
      information were associated with the positive prediction of working in a surgical 
      ICU setting. CONCLUSIONS: A random forest classifier using a frequency-based 
      feature engineering approach successfully predicted work settings of physicians 
      with multiple clinical responsibilities with high accuracy. These findings 
      highlight opportunities for using audit logs for automated assessment of 
      clinician activities and their work settings, thereby affording the ability to 
      accurately assess context-specific work characteristics (eg, workload).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying ambulatory surgical candidates at risk for adverse 
      surgical outcomes can optimize outcomes. The purpose of this study was to develop 
      and internally validate a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict contributors 
      to unexpected hospitalizations after ambulatory unicompartmental knee 
      arthroplasty (UKA). METHODS: A total of 2,521 patients undergoing UKA from 2006 
      to 2018 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients admitted overnight 
      postoperatively were identified as those who had a length of stay ≥ 1 day were 
      analyzed with four individual ML models (ie, random forest, extreme gradient 
      boosting, adaptive boosting, and elastic net penalized logistic regression). An 
      additional model was produced as a weighted ensemble of the four individual 
      algorithms. Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) compared 
      predictive capacity of these models to conventional logistic regression 
      techniques. RESULTS: Of the 2,521 patients identified, 103 (4.1%) required at 
      least one overnight stay following ambulatory UKA. The ML ensemble model achieved 
      the best performance based on discrimination assessed via internal validation 
      (AUROC = 87.3), outperforming individual models and conventional logistic 
      regression (AUROC = 81.9-85.7). The variables determined most important by the 
      ensemble model were cumulative time in the operating room, utilization of general 
      anesthesia, increasing age, and patient residency in more urban areas. The model 
      was integrated into a web-based open-access application. CONCLUSION: The ensemble 
      gradient-boosted ML algorithm demonstrated the highest performance in identifying 
      factors contributing to unexpected hospitalizations in patients receiving UKA. 
      This tool allows physicians and healthcare systems to identify patients at a 
      higher risk of needing inpatient care after UKA.

      results in less pain in the first 90 min after surgery.
PG  - 1086862
LID - 10.3389/fpain.2022.1086862 [doi]
LID - 1086862
AB  - In this pooled analysis of two randomized clinical trials, intraoperative opioid 
      dosing based on the nociception level-index produced less pain compared to 
      standard care with a difference in pain scores in the post-anesthesia care unit 
      of 1.5 (95% CI 0.8-2.2) points on an 11-point scale. The proportion of patients 
      with severe pain was lower by 70%. Severe postoperative pain remains a 
      significant problem and associates with several adverse outcomes. Here, we 
      determined whether the application of a monitor that detects intraoperative 
      nociceptive events, based on machine learning technology, and treatment of such 
      events reduces pain scores in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). To that end, 
      we performed a pooled analysis of two trials in adult patients, undergoing 
      elective major abdominal surgery, on the effect of intraoperative nociception 
      level monitor (NOL)-guided fentanyl dosing on PACU pain was performed. Patients 
      received NOL-guided fentanyl dosing or standard care (fentanyl dosing based on 
      hemodynamic parameters). Goal of the intervention was to keep NOL at values that 
      indicated absence of nociception. The primary endpoint of the study was the 
      median pain score obtained in the first 90 min in the PACU. Pain scores were 
      collected at 15 min intervals on an 11-point Likert scale. Data from 125 patients 
      (55 men, 70 women, age range 21-86 years) were analyzed. Sixty-one patients 
      received NOL-guided fentanyl dosing and 64 standard care. Median PACU pain score 
      was 1.5 points (0.8-2.2) lower in the NOL group compared to the standard care; 
      the proportion of patients with severe pain was 70% lower in the NOL group 
      (p = 0.045). The only significant factor associated with increased odds for 
      severe pain was the standard of care compared to NOL treatment (OR 6.0, 95% CI 
      1.4 -25.9, p = 0.017). The use of a machine learning-based technology to guide 
      opioid dosing during major abdominal surgery resulted in reduced PACU pain scores 
      with less patients in severe pain.

AB  - Background Knowing the predicting factors for difficult neuraxial blocks might 
      help better plan the procedure. This study aimed to determine the predictors of 
      failed spinal arachnoid puncture procedures using artificial neural network (ANN) 
      analysis. Methodology With approvals, prospectively collected data from 300 
      spinal arachnoid punctures in the operation theater of an academic institute 
      having postgraduate anesthesia training were retrospectively evaluated. Fifteen 
      variables from anthropo-demographic, spinal surface anatomy, procedure, and 
      performers' experiences were fed as input for the ANN. A failed spinal arachnoid 
      puncture procedure was defined as the requirement of more than three punctures, 
      with three punctures but more than six passes, or if the performer handed over 
      the procedure to another, considering it difficult after the second puncture. 
      STATCRAFT v.2 software (Predictive Analytics Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru, 
      India) was used for ANN model generation. Considering the overfitting tendency of 
      the ANN, Pr(>|z|) < 0.01 in the ANN was considered significant. The area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic (AuROC) curve of the ANN model and its 
      sensitivity and specificity were also assessed. Significant factors with multiple 
      gradings were also evaluated for their statistical significance across the grades 
      or classes using INSTAT software (Graphpad Prism, La Jolla, CA, USA); a 
      two-tailed P-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results Interspinous 
      process-based spine grade, performers' experience, and positioning difficulty 
      were significant determinants of failed spinal arachnoid puncture procedures in 
      the ANN model. The ANN model had an AuROC of 0.907, specificity of 0.976, and 
      sensitivity of 0.385. The interclass comparison showed that increasing spinal 
      grades and decreasing experiences were associated with increased pass and 
      puncture. Conclusions The ANN model found the determinants of the failed spinal 
      arachnoid puncture procedure well with good AuROC and specificity but poor 
      sensitivity.

TI  - Feasibility of intelligent drug control in the maintenance phase of general 
      anesthesia based on convolutional neural network.
PG  - e12481

AB  - BACKGROUND: The growth and aging process of the human population has accelerated 
      the increase in surgical procedures. Yet, the demand for increasing operations 
      can be hardly met since the training of anesthesiologists is usually a long-term 
      process. Closed-loop artificial intelligence (AI) model provides the possibility 
      to solve intelligent decision-making for anesthesia auxiliary control and, as 
      such, has allowed breakthroughs in closed-loop control of clinical practices in 
      intensive care units (ICUs). However, applying an open-loop artificial 
      intelligence algorithm to build up personalized medication for anesthesia still 
      needs to be further explored. Currently, anesthesiologists have selected doses of 
      intravenously pumped anesthetic drugs mainly based on the blood pressure and 
      bispectral index (BIS), which can express the depth of anesthesia. Unfortunately, 
      BIS cannot be monitored at some medical centers or operational procedures and 
      only be regulated by blood pressure. As a result, here we aim to inaugurally 
      explore the feasibility of a basic intelligent control system applied to drug 
      delivery in the maintenance phase of general anesthesia, based on a convolutional 
      neural network model with open-loop design, according to AI learning of existing 
      anesthesia protocols. METHODS: A convolutional neural network, combined with both 
      sliding window sampling method and residual learning module, was utilized to 
      establish an "AI anesthesiologist" model for intraoperative dosing of 
      personalized anesthetic drugs (propofol and remifentanil). The fitting degree and 
      difference in pumping dose decision, between the AI anesthesiologist and the 
      clinical anesthesiologist, for these personalized anesthetic drugs were examined 
      during the maintenance phase of anesthesia. RESULTS: The medication level 
      established by the "AI anesthesiologist" was comparable to that obtained by the 
      clinical anesthesiologist during the maintenance phase of anesthesia. CONCLUSION: 
      The application of an open-loop decision-making plan by convolutional neural 
      network showed that intelligent anesthesia control is consistent with the actual 
      anesthesia control, thus providing possibility for further evolution and 
      optimization of auxiliary intelligent control of depth of anesthesia.

TI  - Transforming the perioperative medicine care model: The Singapore experience.
PG  - 96-106
LID - 10.1177/0310057X221114900 [doi]
AB  - More than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide annually. Established 
      perioperative centres in the UK, USA and Australia have demonstrated the impact 
      of improving perioperative care in reducing costs, increasing patient 
      satisfaction and improving population health. Likewise, the surgical burden of 
      care in Asia is increasing, but with sociocultural, economic and epigenetic 
      differences compared to the west. As Singapore's largest hospital, the Singapore 
      General Hospital pre-admission perioperative clinic sees about 20,000 patients 
      annually. We aim to illustrate Singapore General Hospital's perioperative model 
      of care to contribute to the paucity of literature describing perioperative 
      programme implementation within Asia, and to encourage the cross-sharing of 
      perioperative practices internationally. Our perioperative framework navigates 
      risk assessment, risk counselling, and mitigation of health, medical and 
      functional risks to better patients' perioperative outcomes and population 
      health. We have implemented evidence-based pathways for common conditions such as 
      anaemia and malnutrition, including a multidisciplinary programme for the elderly 
      to tackle frailty and reduce length of stay. We describe how we have enhanced 
      local risk profiling with the Combined Assessment of Risk Encountered in Surgery 
      surgical risk calculator derived locally using a gradient boosting machine 
      learning model. Finally, we report clinical outcomes of these interventions and 
      discuss further challenges and new initiatives at each tier of our perioperative 
      model. Our perioperative care model provides a framework that other centres can 
      adopt to promote value-driven care, while catering for differences in the Asian 
      population, thereby promoting evidence-based improvements in the area of 
      perioperative medicine.

TI  - Estimating the Depth of Anesthesia from EEG Signals Based on a Deep Residual 
      Shrinkage Network.
LID - 10.3390/s23021008 [doi]
LID - 1008
AB  - The reliable monitoring of the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is essential to control 
      the anesthesia procedure. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used to 
      estimate DoA since EEG could reflect the effect of anesthetic drugs on the 
      central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we propose that a deep learning 
      model consisting mainly of a deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN) and a 1 × 1 
      convolution network could estimate DoA in terms of patient state index (PSI) 
      values. First, we preprocessed the four raw channels of EEG signals to remove 
      electrical noise and other physiological signals. The proposed model then takes 
      the preprocessed EEG signals as inputs to predict PSI values. Then we extracted 
      14 features from the preprocessed EEG signals and implemented three conventional 
      feature-based models as comparisons. A dataset of 18 patients was used to 
      evaluate the models' performances. The results of the five-fold cross-validation 
      show that there is a relatively high similarity between the ground-truth PSI 
      values and the predicted PSI values of our proposed model, which outperforms the 
      conventional models, and further, that the Spearman's rank correlation 
      coefficient is 0.9344. In addition, an ablation experiment was conducted to 
      demonstrate the effectiveness of the soft-thresholding module for EEG-signal 
      processing, and a cross-subject validation was implemented to illustrate the 
      robustness of the proposed method. In summary, the procedure is not merely 
      feasible for estimating DoA by mimicking PSI values but also inspired us to 
      develop a precise DoA-estimation system with more convincing assessments of 
      anesthetization levels.

TI  - Predictors of spinal trauma care and outcomes in a resource-constrained 
      environment: a decision tree analysis of spinal trauma surgery and outcomes in 
      Tanzania.
PG  - 503-511
LID - 10.3171/2022.11.SPINE22763 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The burden of spinal trauma in low- and middle-income countries 
      (LMICs) is immense, and its management is made complex in such 
      resource-restricted settings. Algorithmic evidence-based management is 
      cost-prohibitive, especially with respect to spinal implants, while perioperative 
      care is work-intensive, making overall care dependent on multiple constraints. 
      The objective of this study was to identify determinants of decision-making for 
      surgical intervention, improvement in function, and in-hospital mortality among 
      patients experiencing acute spinal trauma in resource-constrained settings. 
      METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data 
      in a cohort of patients with spinal trauma admitted to a tertiary referral 
      hospital center in Dar es Salam, Tanzania. Data on demographic, clinical, and 
      treatment characteristics were collected as part of a quality improvement 
      neurotrauma registry. Outcome measures were surgical intervention, American 
      Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) grade improvement, and 
      in-hospital mortality, based on existing treatment protocols. Univariate analyses 
      of demographic and clinical characteristics were performed for each outcome of 
      interest. Using the variables associated with each outcome, a machine learning 
      algorithm-based regression nonparametric decision tree model utilizing a 
      bootstrapping method was created and the accuracy of the three models was 
      estimated. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-four consecutively admitted patients with 
      acute spinal trauma were included over a period of 33 months. The median age was 
      34 (IQR 26-43) years, 83.8% were male, and 50.7% had experienced injury in a 
      motor vehicle accident. The median time to hospital admission after injury was 2 
      (IQR 1-6) days; surgery was performed after a further median delay of 22 (IQR 
      13-39) days. Cervical spine injury comprised 38.4% of the injuries. Admission AIS 
      grades were A in 48.9%, B in 16.2%, C in 8.5%, D in 9.5%, and E in 16.6%. Nearly 
      half (45.1%) of the patients underwent surgery, 12% had at least one functional 
      improvement in AIS grade, and 11.6% died in the hospital. Determinants of 
      surgical intervention were age ≤ 30 years, spinal injury level, admission AIS 
      grade, delay in arrival to the referral hospital, undergoing MRI, and type of 
      insurance; admission AIS grade, delay to arrival to the hospital, and injury 
      level for functional improvement; and delay to arrival, injury level, delay to 
      surgery, and admission AIS grade for in-hospital mortality. The best accuracies 
      for the decision tree models were 0.62, 0.34, and 0.93 for surgery, AIS grade 
      improvement, and in-hospital mortality, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Operative 
      intervention and functional improvement after acute spinal trauma in this 
      tertiary referral hospital in an LMIC environment were low and inconsistent, 
      which suggests that nonclinical factors exist within complex resource-driven 
      decision-making frameworks. These nonclinical factors are highlighted by the 
      authors' results showing clinical outcomes and in-hospital mortality were 
      determined by natural history, as evidenced by the highest accuracy of the model 
      predicting in-hospital mortality.

TI  - Auditory stimulation and deep learning predict awakening from coma after cardiac 
      arrest.
PG  - 778-788
LID - 10.1093/brain/awac340 [doi]
AB  - Assessing the integrity of neural functions in coma after cardiac arrest remains 
      an open challenge. Prognostication of coma outcome relies mainly on visual expert 
      scoring of physiological signals, which is prone to subjectivity and leaves a 
      considerable number of patients in a 'grey zone', with uncertain prognosis. 
      Quantitative analysis of EEG responses to auditory stimuli can provide a window 
      into neural functions in coma and information about patients' chances of 
      awakening. However, responses to standardized auditory stimulation are far from 
      being used in a clinical routine due to heterogeneous and cumbersome protocols. 
      Here, we hypothesize that convolutional neural networks can assist in extracting 
      interpretable patterns of EEG responses to auditory stimuli during the first day 
      of coma that are predictive of patients' chances of awakening and survival at 3 
      months. We used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to model single-trial EEG 
      responses to auditory stimuli in the first day of coma, under standardized 
      sedation and targeted temperature management, in a multicentre and multiprotocol 
      patient cohort and predict outcome at 3 months. The use of CNNs resulted in a 
      positive predictive power for predicting awakening of 0.83 ± 0.04 and 0.81 ± 0.06 
      and an area under the curve in predicting outcome of 0.69 ± 0.05 and 0.70 ± 0.05, 
      for patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia and normothermia, respectively. 
      These results also persisted in a subset of patients that were in a clinical 
      'grey zone'. The network's confidence in predicting outcome was based on 
      interpretable features: it strongly correlated to the neural synchrony and 
      complexity of EEG responses and was modulated by independent clinical 
      evaluations, such as the EEG reactivity, background burst-suppression or motor 
      responses. Our results highlight the strong potential of interpretable deep 
      learning algorithms in combination with auditory stimulation to improve 
      prognostication of coma outcome.

TI  - Machine learning-driven clinical decision support system for concept-based 
      searching: a field trial in a Norwegian hospital.
PG  - 5

AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural language processing (NLP) based clinical decision support 
      systems (CDSSs) have demonstrated the ability to extract vital information from 
      patient electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate important decision support 
      tasks. While obtaining accurate, medical domain interpretable results is crucial, 
      it is demanding because real-world EHRs contain many inconsistencies and 
      inaccuracies. Further, testing of such machine learning-based systems in clinical 
      practice has received limited attention and are yet to be accepted by clinicians 
      for regular use. METHODS: We present our results from the evaluation of an 
      NLP-driven CDSS developed and implemented in a Norwegian Hospital. The system 
      incorporates unsupervised and supervised machine learning combined with 
      rule-based algorithms for clinical concept-based searching to identify and 
      classify allergies of concern for anesthesia and intensive care. The system also 
      implements a semi-supervised machine learning approach to automatically annotate 
      medical concepts in the narrative. RESULTS: Evaluation of system adoption was 
      performed by a mixed methods approach applying The Unified Theory of Acceptance 
      and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a theoretical lens. Most of the respondents 
      demonstrated a high degree of system acceptance and expressed a positive attitude 
      towards the system in general and intention to use the system in the future. 
      Increased detection of patient allergies, and thus improved quality of practice 
      and patient safety during surgery or ICU stays, was perceived as the most 
      important advantage of the system. CONCLUSIONS: Our combined machine learning and 
      rule-based approach benefits system performance, efficiency, and 
      interpretability. The results demonstrate that the proposed CDSS increases 
      detection of patient allergies, and that the system received high-level 
      acceptance by the clinicians using it. Useful recommendations for further system 
      improvements and implementation initiatives are reducing the quantity of alarms, 
      expansion of the system to include more clinical concepts, closer EHR system 
      integration, and more workstations available at point of care.

TI  - Applying machine learning methods to predict the hospital re-admission within 30 
      days of total hip arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) and hemiarthroplasty are common 
      treatments for severe hip joint disease. To predict the probability of 
      re-admission after discharge when patients are hospitalized will support 
      providing appropriate health education and guidance. METHODS: The research aims 
      to use logistic regression (LR), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), and 
      artificial neural networks (ANN) to establish predictive models and compare their 
      performances on re-admissions within 30 days after THA or hemiarthroplasty. The 
      data of this study includes patient demographics, physiological measurements, 
      disease history, and clinical laboratory test results. RESULTS: There were 508 
      and 309 patients in the THA and hemiarthroplasty studies respectively from 
      September 2016 to December 2018. The accuracies of the four models LR, DT, RF, 
      and ANN in the THA experiment are 94.3%, 93.2%, 97.3%, and 93.9%, respectively. 
      In the hemiarthroplasty experiment, the accuracies of the four models are 92.4%, 
      86.1%, 94.2%, and 94.8%, respectively. Among these, we found that the RF model 
      has the best sensitivity and ANN model has the best area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic (AUROC) score in both experiments. CONCLUSIONS: The THA 
      experiment confirmed that the performance of the RF model is better than the 
      other models. The key factors affecting the prognosis after THA surgery are 
      creatinine, sodium, anesthesia duration, and dialysis. In the hemiarthroplasty 
      experiment, the ANN model showed more accurate results. Poor kidney function 
      increases the risk of hospital re-admission. This research highlights that RF and 
      ANN model perform well on the hip replacement surgery outcome prediction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a still highly relevant 
      problem and is known to be a distressing side effect in patients. The aim of this 
      study was to develop a machine learning model to predict PONV up to 24 h with 
      fentanyl-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA). METHODS: From 
      July 2019 and July 2020, data from 2,149 patients who received fentanyl-based 
      IV-PCA for analgesia after non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia were 
      applied to develop predictive models. The rates of PONV at 1 day after surgery 
      were measured according to patient characteristics as well as anesthetic, 
      surgical, or PCA-related factors. All statistical analyses and computations were 
      performed using the R software. RESULTS: A total of 2,149 patients were enrolled 
      in this study, 337 of whom (15.7%) experienced PONV. After applying the 
      machine-learning algorithm and Apfel model to the test dataset to predict PONV, 
      we found that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using 
      logistic regression was 0.576 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.520-0.633), 
      k-nearest neighbor was 0.597 (95% CI, 0.537-0.656), decision tree was 0.561 (95% 
      CI, 0.498-0.625), random forest was 0.610 (95% CI, 0.552-0.668), gradient 
      boosting machine was 0.580 (95% CI, 0.520-0.639), support vector machine was 
      0.649 (95% CI, 0.592-0.707), artificial neural network was 0.686 (95% CI, 
      0.630-0.742), and Apfel model was 0.643 (95% CI, 0.596-0.690). CONCLUSIONS: We 
      developed and validated machine learning models for predicting PONV in the first 
      24 h. The machine learning model showed better performance than the Apfel model 
      in predicting PONV.

TI  - Racial and ethnic inequities of palliative care use among advanced Non-Small cell 
      lung cancer patients in the US.
PG  - 8567-8580
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5538 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With early intervention, palliative care (PC) can improve quality of 
      life and increase survival among advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer 
      (aNCSLC) patients. However, PC is often offered late in the cancer treatment 
      course and is underused. We characterized racial/ethnic inequities and the role 
      of healthcare access in PC use among patients with aNSCLC. METHODS: We used data 
      from the 2004-2016 National Cancer Database, including adults aged 18-90 years 
      with aNSCLC (stage 3 or 4 at diagnosis; n = 803,618). Based on the NCCN 
      guidelines, PC includes non-curative surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, pain 
      management, or any combination of non-curative care. We examined PC use by 
      sociodemographic and health care-level characteristics. To evaluate the 
      independent associations of race/ethnicity and health care access characteristics 
      with PC, we estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals 
      (95% CI). Covariate adjustment sets varied by exposure determined using directed 
      acyclic graphs. RESULTS: Our population was 55% male and 77% non-Hispanic/Latinx 
      (NH)-White, with a mean age of 68 years. Overall, 19% of patients with aNSCLC 
      used PC. Compared to NH-White patients, NH-Black (aOR:0.91,95% CI:0.89-0.93) and 
      Hispanic/Latinx (aOR:0.80,95% CI:0.77-0.83) patients were less likely to use PC, 
      whereas Indigenous (AI/AN) (aOR:1.18,95% CI:1.06-1.31) and Native 
      Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (aOR:2.08,95% CI:1.83-2.36) patients were more likely. 
      Overall, compared to the privately-insured, uninsured (aOR:1.19,95% CI:1.11-1.28) 
      and Medicaid-insured patients (aOR:1.19,95% CI:1.14-1.25) were more likely to use 
      PC. CONCLUSION: PC is underutilized among NH-Black and Hispanic/Latinx patients 
      with aNSCLC. Insurance type may play a role in PC use among patients with aNSCLC.

AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the use of EEG as a measure of 
      neurocognitive engagement during a procedural task. In this observational study, 
      self-reported cognitive load, observed performance, and EEG signatures in experts 
      and novices were compared during simulated endotracheal intubation. Twelve 
      medical students (novices) and eight senior anesthesiology trainees (experts) 
      were included in the study. Experts reported significantly lower cognitive load 
      (P < 0.001) and outperformed novices based on the observational checklist 
      (P < 0.001). EEG signatures differed significantly between the experts and 
      novices. Experts showed a greater increase in delta and theta band amplitudes, 
      especially in temporal and frontal locations and in right occipital areas for 
      delta. A machine learning algorithm showed 83.3 % accuracy for expert-novice 
      skill classification using the selected EEG features. Performance scores were 
      positively correlated (P < 0.05) with event-related amplitudes for delta and 
      theta bands at locations where experts and novices showed significant 
      differences. Increased delta and frontal/midline theta oscillations on EEG 
      suggested that experts had better attentional control than novices. This pilot 
      study provides initial evidence that EEG may be a useful, noninvasive measure of 
      neurocognitive engagement in operational settings and that it has the potential 
      to complement traditional clinical skills assessment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of artificial-intelligence perceptual learning 
      when performing the ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic block. METHODS: This 
      simulation-based randomized study enrolled residents who underwent 
      ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block training at the Department of 
      Anesthesiology of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital between January 2022 and February 
      2022. Residents were randomly divided into a traditional teaching group and an AI 
      teaching group. All residents attended the same nerve block theory courses, while 
      those in the AI teaching group participated in training course using an 
      AI-assisted nerve identification system based on a convolutional neural network 
      instead of traditional training. RESULTS: A total of 40 residents were included. 
      The complication rates of paresthesia during puncture in the first month of 
      clinical sciatic nerve block practice after training were significantly lower in 
      the AI teaching group than in the traditional teaching group [11 (4.12%) vs. 36 
      (14.06%), P = 0.000093]. The rates of paresthesia/pain during injection were 
      significantly lower in the AI teaching group than in the traditional teaching 
      group [6 (2.25%) vs. 17 (6.64%), P = 0.025]. The Assessment Checklist for 
      Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia (32 ± 3.8 vs. 29.4 ± 3.9, P = 0.001) and 
      nerve block self-rating scores (7.53 ± 1.62 vs. 6.49 ± 1.85, P < 0.001) were 
      significantly higher in the AI teaching group than in the traditional teaching 
      group. There were no significant differences in the remaining indicators. 
      CONCLUSION: The inclusion of an AI-assisted nerve identification system based on 
      convolutional neural network as part of the training program for 
      ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block via the popliteal approach may reduce the 
      incidence of nerve paresthesia and this might be related to improved perceptual 
      learning. CLINICAL TRIAL: CHiCTR2200055115 , registered on 1/ January /2022.

TI  - Competency-Based Assessments: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to Predict 
      Subcompetency Content.
PG  - 497-504
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000005115 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Faculty feedback on trainees is critical to guiding trainee progress in 
      a competency-based medical education framework. The authors aimed to develop and 
      evaluate a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that automatically 
      categorizes narrative feedback into corresponding Accreditation Council for 
      Graduate Medical Education Milestone 2.0 subcompetencies. METHOD: Ten academic 
      anesthesiologists analyzed 5,935 narrative evaluations on anesthesiology trainees 
      at 4 graduate medical education (GME) programs between July 1, 2019, and June 30, 
      2021. Each sentence (n = 25,714) was labeled with the Milestone 2.0 subcompetency 
      that best captured its content or was labeled as demographic or not useful. 
      Inter-rater agreement was assessed by Fleiss' Kappa. The authors trained an NLP 
      model to predict feedback subcompetencies using data from 3 sites and evaluated 
      its performance at a fourth site. Performance metrics included area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), positive predictive value, 
      sensitivity, F1, and calibration curves. The model was implemented at 1 site in a 
      self-assessment exercise. RESULTS: Fleiss' Kappa for subcompetency agreement was 
      moderate (0.44). Model performance was good for professionalism, interpersonal 
      and communication skills, and practice-based learning and improvement (AUC 0.79, 
      0.79, and 0.75, respectively). Subcompetencies within medical knowledge and 
      patient care ranged from fair to excellent (AUC 0.66-0.84 and 0.63-0.88, 
      respectively). Performance for systems-based practice was poor (AUC 0.59). 
      Performances for demographic and not useful categories were excellent (AUC 0.87 
      for both). In approximately 1 minute, the model interpreted several hundred 
      evaluations and produced individual trainee reports with organized feedback to 
      guide a self-assessment exercise. The model was built into a web-based 
      application. CONCLUSIONS: The authors developed an NLP model that recognized the 
      feedback language of anesthesiologists across multiple GME programs. The model 
      was operationalized in a self-assessment exercise. It is a powerful tool which 
      rapidly organizes large amounts of narrative feedback.

TI  - Using artificial intelligence to improve pain assessment and pain management: a 
      scoping review.
PG  - 570-587
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocac231 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Over 20% of US adults report they experience pain on most days or every 
      day. Uncontrolled pain has led to increased healthcare utilization, 
      hospitalization, emergency visits, and financial burden. Recognizing, assessing, 
      understanding, and treating pain using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches 
      may improve patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. A comprehensive 
      synthesis of the current use and outcomes of AI-based interventions focused on 
      pain assessment and management will guide the development of future research. 
      OBJECTIVES: This review aims to investigate the state of the research on AI-based 
      interventions designed to improve pain assessment and management for adult 
      patients. We also ascertain the actual outcomes of Al-based interventions for 
      adult patients. METHODS: The electronic databases searched include Web of 
      Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital 
      Library. The search initially identified 6946 studies. After screening, 30 
      studies met the inclusion criteria. The Critical Appraisals Skills Programme was 
      used to assess study quality. RESULTS: This review provides evidence that machine 
      learning, data mining, and natural language processing were used to improve 
      efficient pain recognition and pain assessment, analyze self-reported pain data, 
      predict pain, and help clinicians and patients to manage chronic pain more 
      effectively. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this review suggest that using AI-based 
      interventions has a positive effect on pain recognition, pain prediction, and 
      pain self-management; however, most reports are only pilot studies. More pilot 
      studies with physiological pain measures are required before these approaches are 
      ready for large clinical trial.

AB  - Difficult laryngoscopy is associated with airway injury, and asphyxia. There are 
      no guidelines or gold standards for detecting difficult laryngoscopy. There are 
      many opinions on which predictors to use to detect difficult laryngoscopy 
      exposure, and no comprehensively unified comparative analysis has been conducted. 
      The efficacy and accuracy of deep learning (DL)-based models and machine learning 
      (ML)-based models for predicting difficult laryngoscopy need to be evaluated and 
      compared, under the circumstance that the flourishing of deep neural networks 
      (DNN) has increasingly left ML less concentrated and uncreative. For the first 
      time, the performance of difficult laryngoscopy prediction for a dataset of 671 
      patients, under single index and integrated multiple indicators was consistently 
      verified under seven ML-based models and four DL-based approaches. The top dog 
      was a simple traditional machine learning model, Naïve Bayes, outperforming 
      DL-based models, the best test accuracy is 86.6%, the F1 score is 0.908, and the 
      average precision score is 0.837. Three radiological variables of difficult 
      laryngoscopy were all valuable separately and combinedly and the ranking was 
      presented. There is no significant difference in performance among the three 
      radiological indicators individually (83.06% vs. 83.20% vs. 83.33%) and 
      comprehensively (83.74%), suggesting that anesthesiologists can flexibly choose 
      appropriate measurement indicators according to the actual situation to predict 
      difficult laryngoscopy. Adaptive spatial interaction was imposed to the model to 
      boost the performance of difficult laryngoscopy prediction with preoperative 
      cervical spine X-ray.

AB  - PURPOSE: Hypotension is a risk factor for adverse perioperative outcomes. 
      Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography has been extended for preoperative 
      risk assessment before noncardiac surgery. This study aimed to develop a machine 
      learning model to predict postinduction hypotension risk using preoperative 
      echocardiographic data and compared it with conventional statistic models. We 
      also aimed to identify preoperative echocardiographic factors that cause 
      postinduction hypotension. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we 
      extracted data from electronic health records of patients aged >18 years who 
      underwent general anesthesia at a single tertiary care center between April 2014 
      and September 2019. Multiple supervised machine learning classification 
      techniques were used, with postinduction hypotension (mean arterial pressure <55 
      mmHg from intubation to the start of the procedure) as the primary outcome and 95 
      transthoracic echocardiography measurements as factors influencing the primary 
      outcome. Based on the mean cross-validation performance, we used 10-fold 
      cross-validation with the training set (70%) to select the optimal 
      hyperparameters and architecture, assessed ten times using a separate test set 
      (30%). RESULTS: Of 1,956 patients, 670 (34%) had postinduction hypotension. The 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using the deep neural 
      network was 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.67-0.76), gradient boosting 
      machine was 0.54 (95% CI = 0.51-0.59), linear discriminant analysis was 0.56 (95% 
      CI = 0.51-0.61), and logistic regression was 0.56 (95% CI = 0.51-0.61). Variables 
      of high importance included the ascending aorta diameter, transmitral flow A 
      wave, heart rate, pulmonary venous flow S wave, tricuspid regurgitation pressure 
      gradient, inferior vena cava expiratory diameter, fractional shortening, left 
      ventricular mass index, and end-systolic volume. CONCLUSION: We have created 
      developing models that can predict postinduction hypotension using preoperative 
      echocardiographic data, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of using machine 
      learning models of preoperative echocardiographic data for produce higher 
      accuracy than the conventional model.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To critically appraise the literature on the application, 
      methods, and advances in emergency electroencephalography (EEG). RECENT FINDINGS: 
      The development of rapid EEG (rEEG) technologies and other reduced montage 
      approaches, along with advances in machine learning over the past decade, has 
      increased the rate and access to EEG acquisition. These achievements have made 
      EEG in the emergency setting a practical diagnostic technique for detecting 
      seizures, suspected nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), altered mental 
      status, stroke, and in the setting of sedation. Growing evidence supports using 
      EEG to expedite medical decision-making in the setting of suspected acute 
      neurological injury. This review covers approaches to acquiring EEG in the 
      emergency setting in the adult and pediatric populations. We also cover the 
      clinical impact of this data, the time associated with emergency EEG, and the 
      costs of acquiring EEG in these settings. Finally, we discuss the advances in 
      artificial intelligence for rapid electrophysiological interpretation.

AB  - Pediatric medical imaging represents a real challenge for physicians, as children 
      who are patients often move during the examination, and it causes the appearance 
      of different artifacts in the images. Thus, it is not possible to obtain good 
      quality images for this target population limiting the possibility of evaluation 
      and diagnosis in certain pathological conditions. Specifically, magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique that requires long acquisition times and, 
      therefore, demands the use of sedation or general anesthesia to avoid the 
      movement of the patient, which is really damaging in this specific population. 
      Because ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principles should be considered 
      for all imaging studies, one of the most important reasons for establishing novel 
      MRI imaging protocols is to avoid the harmful effects of anesthesia/sedation. In 
      this context, ground-breaking concepts and novel technologies, such as artificial 
      intelligence, can help to find a solution to these challenges while helping in 
      the search for underlying disease mechanisms. The use of new MRI protocols and 
      new image acquisition and/or pre-processing techniques can aid in the development 
      of neuroimaging studies for children evaluation, and their translation to 
      pediatric populations. In this paper, a novel super-resolution method based on a 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) in two and three dimensions to automatically 
      increase the resolution of pediatric brain MRI acquired in a reduced time scheme 
      is proposed. Low resolution images have been generated from an original high 
      resolution dataset and used as the input of the CNN, while several scaling 
      factors have been assessed separately. Apart from a healthy dataset, we also 
      tested our model with pathological pediatric MRI, and it successfully recovers 
      the original image quality in both visual and quantitative ways, even for 
      available examples of dysplasia lesions. We hope then to establish the basis for 
      developing an innovative free-sedation protocol in pediatric anatomical MRI 
      acquisition.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia: A scoping 
      review.
PG  - 994805

LID - 994805
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regional anesthesia is increasingly used in acute postoperative pain 
      management. Ultrasound has been used to facilitate the performance of the 
      regional block, increase the percentage of successfully performed procedures and 
      reduce the complication rate. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been studied in 
      many medical disciplines with achieving high success, especially in radiology. 
      The purpose of this review was to review the evidence on the application of 
      artificial intelligence for optimization and interpretation of the sonographic 
      image, and visualization of needle advancement and injection of local anesthetic. 
      METHODS: To conduct this scoping review, we followed the PRISMA-S guidelines. We 
      included studies if they met the following criteria: (1) Application of 
      Artificial intelligence-assisted in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia; (2) 
      Any human subject (of any age), object (manikin), or animal; (3) Study design: 
      prospective, retrospective, RCTs; (4) Any method of regional anesthesia 
      (epidural, spinal anesthesia, peripheral nerves); (5) Any anatomical localization 
      of regional anesthesia (any nerve or plexus) (6) Any methods of artificial 
      intelligence; (7) Settings: Any healthcare settings (Medical centers, hospitals, 
      clinics, laboratories. RESULTS: The systematic searches identified 78 citations. 
      After the removal of the duplicates, 19 full-text articles were assessed; and 15 
      studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. CONCLUSIONS: AI solutions 
      might be useful in anatomical landmark identification, reducing or even avoiding 
      possible complications. AI-guided solutions can improve the optimization and 
      interpretation of the sonographic image, visualization of needle advancement, and 
      injection of local anesthetic. AI-guided solutions might improve the training 
      process in UGRA. Although significant progress has been made in the application 
      of AI-guided UGRA, randomized control trials are still missing.

TI  - Dementia risk after major elective surgery based on the route of anaesthesia: A 
      propensity score-matched population-based cohort study.
PG  - 101727

LID - 101727
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether the route of anaesthesia is an independent risk factor for 
      dementia remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a propensity score-matched 
      (PSM) population-based cohort study to compare dementia incidence among surgical 
      patients undergoing different routes of anaesthesia. METHODS: The inclusion 
      criteria were being an inpatient >20 years of age who underwent major elective 
      surgery, defined as those requiring GA without or with inhalation anaesthetics or 
      regional anaesthesia, and being hospitalised for >1 day between Jan 1, 2008 and 
      Dec 31, 2019 in Taiwan. Patients undergoing major elective surgery were 
      categorised into three groups according to the type of anaesthesia administered: 
      noninhalation anaesthesia, inhalation anaesthesia, and regional anaesthesia, 
      matched at a 1:1 ratio. The incidence rate (IR) of dementia was determined. 
      FINDINGS: PSM yielded 63,750 patients (21,250 in the noninhalation anaesthesia 
      group, 21,250 in the inhalation anaesthesia group, and 21,250 in the regional 
      anaesthesia group). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the adjusted 
      hazard ratios (aHRs; 95% confidence intervals) of dementia for the inhalation and 
      noninhalation anaesthesia groups compared with the regional anaesthesia group 
      were 20.16 (15.40-26.35; p < 0.001) and 18.33 (14.03-24.04; p < 0.001), 
      respectively. The aHR of dementia for inhalation anaesthesia compared with 
      noninhalation anaesthesia was 1.13 (1.03-1.22; p = 0.028). The IRs of dementia 
      for the inhalation, noninhalation, and regional anaesthesia groups were 3647.90, 
      3492.00, and 272.99 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. INTERPRETATION: In 
      this population based cohort study, the incidence of dementia among surgical 
      patients undergoing general anaesthesia was higher than among those undergoing 
      regional anaesthesia. Among patients undergoing general anaesthesia, inhalation 
      anaesthesia was associated with a higher risk of dementia than noninhalation 
      anaesthesia. Our results should be confirmed in a randomised controlled trial. 
      FUNDING: The study was partially supported by Lo-Hsu Medical Foundation, Lotung 
      Poh-Ai Hospital (Funding Number: 10908, 10909, 11001, 11002, 11003, 11006, and

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) displays an innovative 
      monitoring tool which predicts intraoperative hypotension before its onset. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: We report the case of an 84-year-old Caucasian woman undergoing 
      major spinal surgery with no possibility for the transfer of blood products given 
      her status as a Jehovah's Witness. The hemodynamic treatment algorithm we 
      employed was based on HPI and resulted in a high degree of hemodynamic stability 
      during the surgical procedure. Further, the patient was not at risk for either 
      hypo- or hypervolemia, conditions which might have caused dilution anemia. By 
      using HPI as a tool for patient blood management, it was possible to reduce the 
      incidence of intraoperative hypotension to a minimum. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, this 
      HPI-based treatment algorithm represents a useful application for the treatment 
      of complex anesthesia and perioperative patient blood management. It is a simple 
      but powerful extension of standard monitoring for the prevention of 
      intraoperative hypotension.

AB  - Drugs and various medical substances have been used for many decades to diagnose 
      or treat diseases. Procedures like surgery and anesthesia (either local or 
      general) use different pharmacological products during these events. In most of 
      the cases, the procedure is safe and the physician performs the technique without 
      incidents. Although they are safe for use, these substances (including drugs) may 
      have adverse effects, varying from mild ones to life-threatening reactions in a 
      minority of patients. Artificial intelligence may be a useful tool in 
      approximating the risk of anaphylaxis before undertaking a medical procedure. 
      This material presents these undesirable responses produced by medical products 
      from a multidisciplinary point of view. Moreover, we present a proof of concept 
      for using artificial intelligence as a possible guardship against intraoperative 
      anaphylaxis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery increases morbidity and 
      mortality. Diagnosis relies on oliguria or increased serum creatinine, which 
      develop 48 to 72 hours after injury. We hypothesized machine learning 
      incorporating preoperative, operative, and intensive care unit data could 
      dynamically predict acute kidney injury before conventional identification. 
      METHODS: Cardiac surgery patients at a tertiary hospital (2008-2019) were 
      identified using electronic medical records in the Medical Information Mart for 
      Intensive Care IV database. Preoperative and intraoperative parameters included 
      demographics, Charlson Comorbidity subcategories, and operative details. 
      Intensive care unit data included hemodynamics, medications, fluid intake/output, 
      and laboratory results. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes creatinine 
      criteria were used for acute kidney injury diagnosis. An ensemble machine 
      learning model was trained for hourly predictions of future acute kidney injury 
      within 48 hours. Performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve and balanced accuracy. RESULTS: Within the cohort 
      (n = 4267), there were approximately 7 million data points. Median baseline 
      creatinine was 1.0 g/dL (interquartile range, 0.8-1.2), with 17% (735/4267) of 
      patients having chronic kidney disease. Postoperative stage 1 acute kidney injury 
      occurred in 50% (2129/4267), stage 2 occurred in 8% (324/4267), and stage 3 
      occurred in 4% (183/4267). For hourly prediction of any acute kidney injury over 
      the next 48 hours, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 
      0.82, and balanced accuracy was 75%. For hourly prediction of stage 2 or greater 
      acute kidney injury over the next 48 hours, area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve was 0.95 and balanced accuracy was 86%. The model predicted 
      acute kidney injury before clinical detection in 89% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Ensemble machine learning models using electronic medical records data can 
      dynamically predict acute kidney injury risk after cardiac surgery. Continuous 
      postoperative risk assessment could facilitate interventions to limit or prevent 
      renal injury.

AB  - In order to explore the cultural constructs of pain, a series of focus groups 
      were held among adult American Indian (AI) cancer survivors and their caregivers 
      in the Southwest USA. Thirteen focus groups held at four sites (reservation, 
      urban setting, hospital and clinic) elicited information on the barriers to 
      cancer pain management. In response to facilitator questions about cancer pain 
      and existing measurement scales, participants drew pictures to better explain 
      their pain type (i.e., "pounding"), intensity (i.e., "spider web-like"), and 
      other more abstract aspects of their pain episodes. Noting this novel outlet, 
      subsequent groups were prompted for illustrations of pain. A total of 17 drawings 
      were collected from focus group participants. We discuss seven of the drawings 
      that best opened a window into the lived experience of pain, reflected through 
      the eyes of cancer survivors. This study provides evidence that self-expression 
      through color, imagery and written personal accounts provides more accurate 
      depictions of pain for Southwest AI cancer survivors than pain scales alone. It 
      is hypothesized that cultural modes of communication (i.e., storytelling) and 
      intergenerational influences of artwork led to the depiction of pain in drawings. 
      Suggestions for further exploration of the use of the pain drawings for pain 
      assessment in healthcare settings are included.

      programs.
PG  - 452-456
LID - 10.4103/sja.sja_563_22 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has caused tectonic changes in the personal and professional lives of 
      anesthesiologists and, among several aspects, anesthesiology residency and 
      sub-specialty training has also undergone an unforeseen overhaul. We read the 
      articles published on the impact of COVID-19 on training of anesthesiologists and 
      set out to extract and narrate all the significant observations. At the outset, 
      we begin by explaining how this pandemic posed a threat to the safety of the 
      residents and mitigating measures like PPE and barriers that have now become 'the 
      new normal'. Sub-specialties like critical care, cardiac anesthesia, pain and 
      palliative care have also faced difficulty in imparting training due to an 
      initial dearth in elective surgery case load but have adapted innovative measures 
      to overcome that. Initially, conducting thesis and research became difficult due 
      to problems in achieving the desires sample size needed to get significant 
      results, but this pandemic has emerged as a dynamic laboratory where topics like 
      'psychological impact of COVID-19' and 'development of artificial intelligence 
      models in COVID -19 ICUs' came into the fore. Pattern of examination has also 
      become virtual and webinars showed how knowledge, with the right medium, has the 
      potential of global outreach. As the pandemic took a toll on the mental health of 
      the residents, attention was paid to this previously neglected aspect and 
      ensuring their emotional well-being became a priority to avoid the issue of 
      burn-out. We comment on how what initially was considered a scary problem, 
      actually paved way for growth. It brought attention to safety, innovation, new 
      tools for training, finding solutions within constraints, continuing developing 
      our residents into future leaders who were also trained for mitigating disasters. 
      Changes like online education, research on socio-economic impact, priority to 
      mental health and artificial intelligence are here to stay and by imbibing it, we 
      ensure that 'the show must go on'.

AB  - AIM: Super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) is a status epilepticus (SE) that 
      continues or recurs ≥24 h after the onset of anesthesia. We aimed to identify the 
      predictors of progression to SRSE and the risk of 30-day mortality in patients 
      with SRSE by using a machine learning technique. METHODS: We reviewed consecutive 
      SE episodes in patients aged ≥14 years at Baggiovara Civil Hospital (Modena, 
      Italy) from 2013 to 2021. A classification and regression tree analysis was 
      performed to develop a predictive model of progression to SRSE in SE patients. In 
      SRSE patients, a multivariate analysis was conducted to identify predictors of 
      30-day mortality. RESULTS: We included 705 patients, 16% of whom (113/705) 
      progressed to SRSE. Acute symptomatic hypoxic etiology and age ≤ 68.5 years 
      predicted the highest risk (87.1%) of progression to SRSE. Etiology other than 
      acute symptomatic hypoxic and absence of NCSE predicted the lowest risk (3.6%) of 
      progression to SRSE. The predictive model was accurate in 96.1% of patients not 
      evolving to SRSE and in 48.7% of those evolving to SRSE. Among patients with 
      SRSE, 46.9% (53/113) died within 30 days compared to 25.2% (149/592) of patients 
      without SRSE (p < 0.001). Among patients with SRSE, older age was associated with 
      increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio 1.075; 95% confidence interval: 
      1.031-1.112; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Acute symptomatic hypoxic etiology and 
      younger age are major predictors of progression to SRSE. In patients with SRSE, 
      older age is associated with increased risk of short-term mortality.

TI  - Mortality Prediction of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Patients Using the 2020 
      Diagnosis Procedure Combination Administrative Database of Japan.

AB  - Objectives Numerous people have died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      infection. Identifying crucial predictive biomarkers of disease mortality is 
      critical to support decision-making and logistic planning in healthcare systems. 
      This study investigated the association between mortality and medical factors and 
      prescription records in 2020 in Japan, where COVID-19 prevalence and mortality 
      remain relatively low. Methods This retrospective cohort study analyzed anonymous 
      administrative data from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database in 
      Japan. Results A total of 22,795 patients were treated in DPC hospitals in 2020 
      in Japan, and of these, 5,980 patients over 50 years old were hospitalized, with 
      299 (5.0%) dying. There were 2,399 severe patients among 11,440 total 
      hospitalized patients (all ages). The results of a logistic model analysis 
      revealed that an older age, male sex, Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular 
      diseases, and chronic kidney diseases were risk factors for mortality. A machine 
      learning analysis identified an older age, male sex (mortality), pneumonia, drugs 
      for acid-related disorders, analgesics, anesthesia, upper respiratory tract 
      disease, drugs for functional gastrointestinal disorders, drugs for obstructive 
      airway diseases, topical products for joint and muscular pain, diabetes, 
      lipid-modifying agents, calcium channel blockers, drugs for diabetes, and agents 
      acting on the renin-angiotensin system as risk factors for a severe status. 
      Conclusions This COVID-19 mortality risk tool is a well-calibrated and accurate 
      model for predicting mortality risk among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in 
      Japan, which is characterized by a relatively low COVID-19 prevalence, aging 
      society, and high population density. This COVID-19 mortality prediction model 
      can assist in resource utilization and patient and caregiver education and be 
      useful as a risk stratification instrument for future research trials.

TI  - Machine-learning model predicting postoperative delirium in older patients using 
      intraoperative frontal electroencephalographic signatures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In older patients receiving general anesthesia, postoperative delirium 
      (POD) is the most frequent form of cerebral dysfunction. Early identification of 
      patients at higher risk to develop POD could provide the opportunity to adapt 
      intraoperative and postoperative therapy. We, therefore, propose a machine 
      learning approach to predict the risk of POD in elderly patients, using routine 
      intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) and clinical data that are readily 
      available in the operating room. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis 
      of the data of a single-center study at the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, 
      Department of Anesthesiology [ISRCTN 36437985], including 1,277 patients, older 
      than 60 years with planned surgery and general anesthesia. To deal with the class 
      imbalance, we used balanced ensemble methods, specifically Bagging and Random 
      Forests and as a performance measure, the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). We 
      trained our models including basic clinical parameters and intraoperative EEG 
      features in particular classical spectral and burst suppression signatures as 
      well as multi-band covariance matrices, which were classified, taking advantage 
      of the geometry of a Riemannian manifold. The models were validated with 10 
      repeats of a 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: Including EEG data in the 
      classification resulted in a robust and reliable risk evaluation for POD. The 
      clinical parameters alone achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.75. Including EEG 
      signatures improved the classification when the patients were grouped by 
      anesthetic agents and evaluated separately for each group. The spectral features 
      alone showed an AUC-ROC score of 0.66; the covariance features showed an AUC-ROC 
      score of 0.68. The AUC-ROC scores of EEG features relative to patient data 
      differed by anesthetic group. The best performance was reached, combining both 
      the EEG features and the clinical parameters. Overall, the AUC-ROC score was 
      0.77, for patients receiving Propofol it was 0.78, for those receiving 
      Sevoflurane it was 0.8 and for those receiving Desflurane 0.73. Applying the 
      trained prediction model to an independent data set of a different clinical study 
      confirmed these results for the combined classification, while the classifier on 
      clinical parameters alone did not generalize. CONCLUSION: A machine learning 
      approach combining intraoperative frontal EEG signatures with clinical parameters 
      could be an easily applicable tool to early identify patients at risk to develop 
      POD.

      (LSTM) in electronic health record.
PG  - 120-131
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocac210 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and test an accurate deep learning model for predicting new 
      onset delirium in hospitalized adult patients. METHODS: Using electronic health 
      record (EHR) data extracted from a large academic medical center, we developed a 
      model combining long short-term memory (LSTM) and machine learning to predict new 
      onset delirium and compared its performance with machine-learning-only models 
      (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, neural network, and 
      LightGBM). The labels of models were confusion assessment method (CAM) 
      assessments. We evaluated models on a hold-out dataset. We calculated Shapley 
      additive explanations (SHAP) measures to gauge the feature impact on the model. 
      RESULTS: A total of 331 489 CAM assessments with 896 features from 34 035 
      patients were included. The LightGBM model achieved the best performance (AUC 
      0.927 [0.924, 0.929] and F1 0.626 [0.618, 0.634]) among the machine learning 
      models. When combined with the LSTM model, the final model's performance improved 
      significantly (P = .001) with AUC 0.952 [0.950, 0.955] and F1 0.759 [0.755, 
      0.765]. The precision value of the combined model improved from 0.497 to 0.751 
      with a fixed recall of 0.8. Using the mean absolute SHAP values, we identified 
      the top 20 features, including age, heart rate, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale 
      score, Morse fall risk score, pulse, respiratory rate, and level of care. 
      CONCLUSION: Leveraging LSTM to capture temporal trends and combining it with the 
      LightGBM model can significantly improve the prediction of new onset delirium, 
      providing an algorithmic basis for the subsequent development of clinical 
      decision support tools for proactive delirium interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Artificial intelligence was born to allow computers to learn 
      and control their environment, trying to imitate the human brain structure by 
      simulating its biological evolution. Artificial intelligence makes it possible to 
      analyze large amounts of data (big data) in real-time, providing forecasts that 
      can support the clinician's decisions. This scenario can include diagnosis, 
      prognosis, and treatment in anesthesiology, intensive care medicine, and pain 
      medicine. Machine Learning is a subcategory of AI. It is based on algorithms 
      trained for decisions making that automatically learn and recognize patterns from 
      data. This article aims to offer an overview of the potential application of AI 
      in anesthesiology and analyzes the operating principles of machine learning Every 
      Machine Learning pathway starts from task definition and ends in model 
      application. CONCLUSIONS: High-performance characteristics and strict quality 
      controls are needed during its progress. During this process, different measures 
      can be identified (pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, 
      model processing and evaluation). For inexperienced operators, the process can be 
      facilitated by ad hoc tools for data engineering, machine learning, and 
      analytics.

TI  - Burnout in Italian anesthesiologists and intensivists during the COVID-19 
      pandemic: a national survey.
PG  - 188-196

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic added additional burden upon healthcare systems and 
      anesthesiology and intensive care physicians (AI) who possessed crucial expertise 
      for dealing with the pandemic. Aim of the study was to uncover specific burnout 
      patterns among Italian AI, exploring the hypothesis that burnout has a 
      multicluster structure. Differences in social and professional characteristics 
      between burnout patterns were explored. METHODS: One thousand and nine AI (658 
      women) members of the Società Italiana di Anestesia Analgesia Rianimazione e 
      Terapia Intensiva (SIAARTI) working during COVID-19 pandemic participated. 
      Sociodemographic, working information and burnout levels evaluated through 
      Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) were collected. RESULTS: According to the MBI 
      cutoff, 39.7% and 25.8% of participants scored high in emotional exhaustion and 
      depersonalization respectively, and 44.2% scored low in personal accomplishment. 
      Cluster analysis highlighted four burnout profiles: resilience, detachment, 
      burnout, and emotional reserve. The results showed that AI in the Resilience and 
      Emotional Reserve groups were significantly older and more experienced than those 
      in the Detachment and Burnout groups. Additionally, more of the individuals in 
      the Resilience group were working in intensive care units and departments 
      dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The Detachment group was comprised of more AI 
      working in operating units, while the Burnout group contained a higher number of 
      AI working in COVID-19 departments. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight 
      different burnout patterns in Italian AI: older age, more professional 
      experience, and work in intensive care units and departments dedicated to 
      COVID-19 seemed to be protective factors during the pandemic. This appears a 
      first step to promote focused interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Implementing tools that identify cost-saving opportunities for 
      ambulatory orthopaedic surgeries can improve access to value-based care. We 
      developed and internally validated a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict 
      cost drivers of total charges after ambulatory unicompartmental knee arthroplasty 
      (UKA). METHODS: We queried the New York State Ambulatory Surgery and Services 
      database to identify patients who underwent ambulatory, defined as <24 hours of 
      care before discharge, elective UKA between 2014 and 2016. A total of 1,311 
      patients were included. The median costs after ambulatory UKA were $14,710. 
      Patient demographics and intraoperative parameters were entered into 4 candidate 
      ML algorithms. The most predictive model was selected following internal 
      validation of candidate models, with conventional linear regression as a 
      benchmark. Global variable importance and partial dependence curves were 
      constructed to determine the impact of each input parameter on total charges. 
      RESULTS: The gradient-boosted ensemble model outperformed all candidate 
      algorithms and conventional linear regression. The major differential cost 
      drivers of UKA identified (in decreasing order of magnitude) were increased 
      operating room time, length of stay, use of regional and adjunctive periarticular 
      analgesia, utilization of computer-assisted navigation, and routinely sending 
      resected tissue to pathology. CONCLUSION: We developed and internally validated a 
      supervised ML algorithm that identified operating room time, length of stay, use 
      of computer-assisted navigation, regional primary anesthesia, adjunct 
      periarticular analgesia, and routine surgical pathology as essential cost drivers 
      of UKA. Following external validation, this tool may enable surgeons and health 
      insurance providers optimize the delivery of value-based care to patients 
      receiving outpatient UKA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as the preferred imaging modality 
      for evaluating a wide range of pediatric medical conditions. Nevertheless, the 
      long acquisition times associated with this technique can limit its widespread 
      use in young children, resulting in motion-degraded or non-diagnostic studies. As 
      a result, sedation or general anesthesia is often necessary to obtain diagnostic 
      images, which has implications for the safety profile of MRI, the cost of the 
      exam and the radiology department's clinical workflow. Over the last decade, 
      several techniques have been developed to increase the speed of MRI, including 
      parallel imaging, single-shot acquisition, controlled aliasing techniques, 
      compressed sensing and artificial-intelligence-based reconstructions. These are 
      advantageous because shorter examinations decrease the need for sedation and the 
      severity of motion artifacts, increase scanner throughput, and improve system 
      efficiency. In this review we discuss a framework for image acceleration in 
      children that includes the synergistic use of state-of-the-art MRI hardware and 
      optimized pulse sequences. The discussion is framed within the context of 
      pediatric radiology and incorporates the authors' experience in deploying these 
      techniques in routine clinical practice.

TI  - Automated machine learning-based model for the prediction of delirium in patients 
      after surgery for degenerative spinal disease.
PG  - 282-295
LID - 10.1111/cns.14002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study used machine learning algorithms to identify critical 
      variables and predict postoperative delirium (POD) in patients with degenerative 
      spinal disease. METHODS: We included 663 patients who underwent surgery for 
      degenerative spinal disease and received general anesthesia. The LASSO method was 
      used to screen essential features associated with POD. Clinical characteristics, 
      preoperative laboratory parameters, and intraoperative variables were reviewed 
      and were used to construct nine machine learning models including a training set 
      and validation set (80% of participants), and were then evaluated in the rest of 
      the study sample (20% of participants). The area under the receiver-operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC) and Brier scores were used to compare the prediction 
      performances of different models. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithms 
      (XGBOOST) model was used to predict POD. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) 
      package was used to interpret the XGBOOST model. Data of 49 patients were 
      prospectively collected for model validation. RESULTS: The XGBOOST model 
      outperformed the other classifier models in the training set (area under the 
      curve [AUC]: 92.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.7%-95.0%), validation set 
      (AUC: 87.0%, 95% CI: 80.7%-93.3%). This model also achieved the lowest Brier 
      Score. Twelve vital variables, including age, serum albumin, the 
      admission-to-surgery time interval, C-reactive protein level, hypertension, 
      intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative minimum blood pressure, 
      cardiovascular-cerebrovascular disease, smoking, alcohol consumption, pulmonary 
      disease, and admission-intraoperative maximum blood pressure difference, were 
      selected. The XGBOOST model performed well in the prospective cohort (accuracy: 
      85.71%). CONCLUSION: A machine learning model and a web predictor for delirium 
      after surgery for the degenerative spinal disease were successfully developed to 
      demonstrate the extent of POD risk during the perioperative period, which could 
      guide appropriate preventive measures for high-risk patients.

      collaborative serum metabolite and magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy.

AB  - Gastrointestinal diseases are complex diseases that occur in the gastrointestinal 
      tract. Common gastrointestinal diseases include chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, 
      inflammatory bowel disease, and gastrointestinal tumors. These diseases may 
      manifest a long course, difficult treatment, and repeated attacks. Gastroscopy 
      and mucosal biopsy are the gold standard methods for diagnosing gastric and 
      duodenal diseases, but they are invasive procedures and carry risks due to the 
      necessity of sedation and anesthesia. Recently, several new approaches have been 
      developed, including serological examination and magnetically controlled capsule 
      endoscopy (MGCE). However, serological markers lack lesion information, while 
      MGCE images lack molecular information. This study proposes combining these two 
      technologies in a collaborative noninvasive diagnostic scheme as an alternative 
      to the standard procedures. We introduce an interpretable framework for the 
      clinical diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. Based on collected blood samples 
      and MGCE records of patients with gastrointestinal diseases and comparisons with 
      normal individuals, we selected serum metabolite signatures by bioinformatic 
      analysis, captured image embedding signatures by convolutional neural networks, 
      and inferred the location-specific associations between these signatures. Our 
      study successfully identified five key metabolite signatures with functional 
      relevance to gastrointestinal disease. The combined signatures achieved 
      discrimination AUC of 0.88. Meanwhile, the image embedding signatures showed 
      different levels of validation and testing accuracy ranging from 0.7 to 0.9 
      according to different locations in the gastrointestinal tract as explained by 
      their specific associations with metabolite signatures. Overall, our work 
      provides a new collaborative noninvasive identification pipeline and candidate 
      metabolite biomarkers for image auxiliary diagnosis. This method should be 
      valuable for the noninvasive detection and interpretation of gastrointestinal and 
      other complex diseases.

TI  - Critical element prediction of tracheal intubation difficulty: Automatic 
      Mallampati classification by jointly using handcrafted and attention-based deep 
      features.

AB  - Preoperative assessment of the difficulty of tracheal intubation is of great 
      importance in anesthesia practice because failed intubation can lead to severe 
      complications and even death. The Mallampati score is widely used as a critical 
      assessment criterion in combination with other measures to assess the difficulty 
      of tracheal intubation. The performance of existing methods for Mallampati 
      classification with artificial intelligence (AI) is unreliable to the extent that 
      the current clinical judgment of the Mallampati score relies entirely on doctors' 
      experience. In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic Mallampati 
      classification. Our method extracts deep features that are more favorable for the 
      Mallampati classification task by introducing an attention mechanism into the 
      basic deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and then further improves the 
      classification performance by jointly using attention-based deep features with 
      handcrafted features. We conducted experiments on a dataset consisting of 321 
      oral images collected online. The proposed method has a classification accuracy 
      of 97.50%, a sensitivity of 96.52%, a specificity of 98.05%, and an F1 score of 
      96.52% after five-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that our 
      proposed method is superior to other methods, can assist doctors in determining 
      Mallampati class objectively and accurately, and provide an essential reference 
      element for assessing the difficulty of tracheal intubation.

TI  - Hypotension Prediction Index Software to Prevent Intraoperative Hypotension 
      during Major Non-Cardiac Surgery: Protocol for a European Multicenter Prospective 
      Observational Registry (EU-HYPROTECT).
LID - 10.3390/jcm11195585 [doi]
LID - 5585
AB  - Background: Intraoperative hypotension is common in patients having non-cardiac 
      surgery and associated with postoperative acute myocardial injury, acute kidney 
      injury, and mortality. Avoiding intraoperative hypotension is a complex task for 
      anesthesiologists. Using artificial intelligence to predict hypotension from 
      clinical and hemodynamic data is an innovative and intriguing approach. The 
      AcumenTM Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) software (Edwards Lifesciences; 
      Irvine, CA, USA) was developed using artificial intelligence—specifically machine 
      learning—and predicts hypotension from blood pressure waveform features. We aimed 
      to describe the incidence, duration, severity, and causes of intraoperative 
      hypotension when using HPI monitoring in patients having elective major 
      non-cardiac surgery. Methods: We built up a European, multicenter, prospective, 
      observational registry including at least 700 evaluable patients from five 
      European countries. The registry includes consenting adults (≥18 years) who were 
      scheduled for elective major non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia that 
      was expected to last at least 120 min and in whom arterial catheter placement and 
      HPI monitoring was planned. The major objectives are to quantify and characterize 
      intraoperative hypotension (defined as a mean arterial pressure [MAP] < 65 mmHg) 
      when using HPI monitoring. This includes the time-weighted average (TWA) MAP < 65 
      mmHg, area under a MAP of 65 mmHg, the number of episodes of a MAP < 65 mmHg, the 
      proportion of patients with at least one episode (1 min or more) of a MAP < 65 
      mmHg, and the absolute maximum decrease below a MAP of 65 mmHg. In addition, we 
      will assess causes of intraoperative hypotension and investigate associations 
      between intraoperative hypotension and postoperative outcomes. Discussion: There 
      are only sparse data on the effect of using HPI monitoring on intraoperative 
      hypotension in patients having elective major non-cardiac surgery. Therefore, we 
      built up a European, multicenter, prospective, observational registry to describe 
      the incidence, duration, severity, and causes of intraoperative hypotension when 
      using HPI monitoring in patients having elective major non-cardiac surgery.

TI  - Machine learning model-based risk prediction of severe complications after 
      off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.
PG  - 185-194
LID - 10.17219/acem/152895 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) under 
      cardiopulmonary bypass, off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is minimally 
      invasive and reduces the risk of intraoperative blood transfusion and acute 
      kidney injury. Nonetheless, OPCAB-related complications still pose a threat. 
      Machine learning technology can analyze a large number of clinical data, 
      establish risk prediction models and help clinicians make early and correct 
      clinical decisions. OBJECTIVES: Risk prediction models are available for 
      mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery, but they are not specific to 
      OPCAB. This study aimed to develop a predictive model of severe complications 
      after OPCAB, based on machine learning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Anesthesia records 
      of OPCAB from the General Hospital of the Northern Theater Command (Shenyang, 
      China) collected between January 1, 2019, and June 15, 2020, were analyzed. The 
      endpoint of the study was the occurrence of serious complications after OPCAB 
      (postoperative unplanned intra-aortic balloon pump, secondary surgery and death). 
      The features entered into the models were as follows: intraoperative ventricular 
      fibrillation, number of saphenous vein grafts, nerve block (NeB), venous oxygen 
      saturation (SvO2), skin incision-bypass time, and hypertension. A total of 8 
      machine learning algorithms were tested: logistic regression analysis (LRA), 
      k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), random 
      forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine 
      (LightGBM), and categorical features gradient boosting (CatBoost). RESULTS: Among 
      the 506 patients found in the records, 27 met the endpoint. The highest area 
      under the curve (AUC) value was achieved with the XGBoost model (AUC = 0.94), and 
      the lowest with the SVM model (AUC = 0.75). The highest and lowest accuracy were 
      observed with the XGBoost and NB models, respectively, while the highest and 
      lowest precision were achieved using the SVM and NB models, respectively. Based 
      on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the XGBoost model was 
      selected as the most useful in this study. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests using 
      the XGBoost model to predict the risk of complications after OPCAB.

TI  - Evaluating the effect of an artificial intelligence system on the anesthesia 
      quality control during gastrointestinal endoscopy with sedation: a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 313
LID - 10.1186/s12871-022-01796-1 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sedative gastrointestinal endoscopy is extensively used worldwide. An 
      appropriate degree of sedation leads to more acceptability and satisfaction. 
      Artificial intelligence has rapidly developed in the field of digestive endoscopy 
      in recent years and we have constructed a mature computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) 
      system. This system can identify the remaining parts to be examined in real-time 
      endoscopic procedures, which may help anesthetists use anesthetics properly to 
      keep patients in an appropriate degree of sedation. AIMS: This study aimed to 
      evaluate the effects of the CAD system on anesthesia quality control during 
      gastrointestinal endoscopy. METHODS: We recruited 154 consecutive patients at 
      Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, including 76 patients in the CAD group and 
      78 in the control group. Anesthetists in the CAD group were able to see the CAD 
      system's indications, while anesthetists in the control group could not. The 
      primary outcomes included emergence time (from examination completion to 
      spontaneous eye opening when doctors called the patients' names), recovery time 
      (from examination completion to achievement of the primary recovery endpoints) 
      and patient satisfaction scores. The secondary outcomes included anesthesia 
      induction time (from sedative administration to successful sedation), procedure 
      time (from scope insertion to scope withdrawal), total dose of propofol, vital 
      signs, etc. This trial was registered in the Primary Registries of the WHO 
      Registry Network, with registration number ChiCTR2100042621. RESULTS: Emergence 
      time in the CAD group was significantly shorter than that in the control group 
      (p < 0.01). The recovery time was also significantly shorter in the CAD group 
      (p < 0.01). Patients in the CAD group were significantly more satisfied with 
      their sedation than those in control group (p < 0.01). Vital signs were stable 
      during the examinations in both groups. Propofol doses during the examinations 
      were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This CAD system possesses 
      great potential for anesthesia quality control. It can improve patient 
      satisfaction during endoscopic examinations with sedation. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among women worldwide and more 
      than half are diagnosed above the age of 60 years. Life expectancy is increasing 
      and the number of breast cancer cases diagnosed among older women are expected to 
      increase. Undertreatment, mostly due to unjustifiable fears of advanced-age and 
      associated comorbidities, is commonly practiced in this group of patients who are 
      under-represented in clinical trials and their management is not properly 
      addressed in clinical practice guidelines. With modern surgery and anesthesia, 
      breast surgeries are considered safe and is usually associated with very low 
      complication rates, regardless of extent of surgery. However, oncoplastic surgery 
      and management of the axilla can be tailored based on patients'- and 
      disease-related factors. Most of chemotherapeutic agents, along with targeted 
      therapy and anti-Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) drugs can be 
      safely given for older patients, however, dose adjustment and close monitoring of 
      potential adverse events might be needed. The recently introduced cyclin-D kinase 
      (CDK) 4/6-inhibitors in combination with aromatase inhibitors (AI) or 
      fulvestrant, which changed the landscape of breast cancer therapy, are both safe 
      and effective in older patients and had substituted more aggressive and 
      potentially toxic interventions. Despite its proven efficacy, adjusting or even 
      omitting adjuvant radiation therapy, at least in low-risk older patients, is safe 
      and frequently practiced. In this paper, we review existing data related to 
      breast cancer management among older patients across the continuum; from 
      resection of the primary tumor through adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation and 
      endocrine therapy up to the management of recurrent and advanced-stage disease.

AB  - The goal of this study was to identify features in mouse electrocorticogram 
      recordings that indicate the depth of anesthesia as approximated by the 
      administered anesthetic dosage. Anesthetic depth in laboratory animals must be 
      precisely monitored and controlled. However, for the most common lab species 
      (mice) few indicators useful for monitoring anesthetic depth have been 
      established. We used electrocorticogram recordings in mice, coupled with 
      peripheral stimulation, in order to identify features of brain activity modulated 
      by isoflurane anesthesia and explored their usefulness in monitoring anesthetic 
      depth through machine learning techniques. Using a gradient boosting regressor 
      framework we identified interhemispheric somatosensory coherence as the most 
      informative and reliable electrocorticogram feature for determining anesthetic 
      depth, yielding good generalization and performance over many subjects. Knowing 
      that interhemispheric somatosensory coherence indicates the effectively 
      administered isoflurane concentration is an important step for establishing 
      better anesthetic monitoring protocols and closed-loop systems for animal 
      surgeries.

AB  - Hemodynamic monitoring is the centerpiece of patient monitoring in acute care 
      settings. Its effectiveness in terms of improved patient outcomes is difficult to 
      quantify. This review focused on effectiveness of monitoring-linked resuscitation 
      strategies from: (1) process-specific monitoring that allows for non-specific 
      prevention of new onset cardiovascular insufficiency (CVI) in perioperative care. 
      Such goal-directed therapy is associated with decreased perioperative 
      complications and length of stay in high-risk surgery patients. (2) 
      Patient-specific personalized resuscitation approaches for CVI. These approaches 
      including dynamic measures to define volume responsiveness and vasomotor tone, 
      limiting less fluid administration and vasopressor duration, reduced length of 
      care. (3) Hemodynamic monitoring to predict future CVI using machine learning 
      approaches. These approaches presently focus on predicting hypotension. Future 
      clinical trials assessing hemodynamic monitoring need to focus on 
      process-specific monitoring based on modifying therapeutic interventions known to 
      improve patient-centered outcomes.

TI  - Targeting the PANoptosome with 3,4-Methylenedioxy-β-Nitrostyrene, Reduces 
      PANoptosis and Protects the Kidney against Renal İschemia-Reperfusion Injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were a) to investigate the effect of 
      targeting the PANoptosome with 3,4-methylenedioxy-β-nitrostyrene (MNS) on 
      PANoptosis in the Renal ischemia-reperfussion (RIR) model b) to investigate the 
      kidney protective effect of MNS toward RIR injury. METHODS: Thirty-two rats were 
      divided into four groups randomly. The groups were assigned as Control, Sham, 
      DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and MNS groups. The rats in the MNS group were 
      intraperitoneally given 20 mg/kg of MNS 30 minutes before reperfusion. 2% DMSO 
      solvent that dissolves MNS were given to the rats in DMSO group. Left nephrectomy 
      was performed on the rats under anesthesia at the 6th hour after reperfusion. 
      Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide 
      dismutase (SOD) and 8-Okso-2'-deoksiguanozin (8-OHdG) levels were measured. 
      Immunohistochemical analysis, electron microscopic and histological examinations 
      were carried out in the tissues. RESULTS: Total tubular injury score was lower in 
      the MNS group (p < 0.001). Caspase-3, Gasdermin D and MLK (Mixed Lineage Kinase 
      Domain Like Pseudokinase) expressions were considerably decreased in the MNS 
      group (p < 0.001). Apoptotic index (AI) was found to be low in the MNS group 
      (p < 0.001). CAT and SOD levels were higher in the MNS Group (p = 0.006, 
      p = 0.0004, respectively). GPx, MDA, and 8-OH-dG levels were similar (p > 0.05) 
      in all groups. MNS considerably improved the tissue structure, based on the 
      electron microscopic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that MNS 
      administrated before the reperfusion reduces pyroptosis, apoptosis and 
      necroptosis. These findings suggest that MNS significantly protects the kidney 
      against RIR injury by reducing PANoptosis as a result of specific inhibition of 
      Nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP 3), one of the PANoptosome 
      proteins.

TI  - Mother's physical activity during pregnancy and newborn's brain cortical 
      development.
PG  - 943341

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity is known to improve mental health, and is regarded 
      as safe and desirable for uncomplicated pregnancy. In this novel study, we aim to 
      evaluate whether there are associations between maternal physical activity during 
      pregnancy and neonatal brain cortical development. METHODS: Forty-four 
      mother/newborn dyads were included in this longitudinal study. Healthy pregnant 
      women were recruited and their physical activity throughout pregnancy were 
      documented using accelerometers worn for 3-7 days for each of the 6 time points 
      at 4-10, ∼12, ∼18, ∼24, ∼30, and ∼36 weeks of pregnancy. Average daily total 
      steps and daily total activity count as well as daily minutes spent in 
      sedentary/light/moderate/vigorous activity modes were extracted from the 
      accelerometers for each time point. At ∼2 weeks of postnatal age, their newborns 
      underwent an MRI examination of the brain without sedation, and 3D T1-weighted 
      brain structural images were post-processed by the iBEAT2.0 software utilizing 
      advanced deep learning approaches. Cortical surface maps were reconstructed from 
      the segmented brain images and parcellated to 34 regions in each brain 
      hemisphere, and mean cortical thickness for each region was computed for partial 
      correlation analyses with physical activity measures, with appropriate multiple 
      comparison corrections and potential confounders controlled. RESULTS: At 4-10 
      weeks of pregnancy, mother's daily total activity count positively correlated 
      (FDR corrected P ≤ 0.05) with newborn's cortical thickness in the left caudal 
      middle frontal gyrus (rho = 0.48, P = 0.04), right medial orbital frontal gyrus 
      (rho = 0.48, P = 0.04), and right transverse temporal gyrus (rho = 0.48, P = 
      0.04); mother's daily time in moderate activity mode positively correlated with 
      newborn's cortical thickness in the right transverse temporal gyrus (rho = 0.53, 
      P = 0.03). At ∼24 weeks of pregnancy, mother's daily total activity count 
      positively correlated (FDR corrected P ≤ 0.05) with newborn's cortical thickness 
      in the left (rho = 0.56, P = 0.02) and right isthmus cingulate gyrus (rho = 0.50, 
      P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: We identified significant relationships between physical 
      activity in healthy pregnant women during the 1st and 2nd trimester and brain 
      cortical development in newborns. Higher maternal physical activity level is 
      associated with greater neonatal brain cortical thickness, presumably indicating 
      better cortical development.

TI  - Different Machine Learning Approaches for Implementing Telehealth-Based Cancer 
      Pain Management Strategies.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11185484 [doi]
LID - 5484
AB  - Background: The most effective strategy for managing cancer pain remotely should 
      be better defined. There is a need to identify those patients who require 
      increased attention and calibrated follow-up programs. Methods: Machine learning 
      (ML) models were developed using the data prospectively obtained from a 
      single-center program of telemedicine-based cancer pain management. These models 
      included random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), artificial neural 
      network (ANN), and the LASSO−RIDGE algorithm. Thirteen demographic, social, 
      clinical, and therapeutic variables were adopted to define the conditions that 
      can affect the number of teleconsultations. After ML validation, the risk 
      analysis for more than one remote consultation was assessed in target 
      individuals. Results: The data from 158 patients were collected. In the training 
      set, the accuracy was about 95% and 98% for ANN and RF, respectively. 
      Nevertheless, the best accuracy on the test set was obtained with RF (70%). The 
      ML-based simulations showed that young age (<55 years), lung cancer, and 
      occurrence of breakthrough cancer pain help to predict the number of remote 
      consultations. Elderly patients (>75 years) with bone metastases may require more 
      telemedicine-based clinical evaluations. Conclusion: ML-based analyses may enable 
      clinicians to identify the best model for predicting the need for more remote 
      consultations. It could be useful for calibrating care interventions and resource 
      allocation.

TI  - The signaling and selectivity of α-adrenoceptor agonists for the human α2A, α2B 
      and α2C-adrenoceptors and comparison with human α1 and β-adrenoceptors.

AB  - α2-adrenoceptors, (α2A, α2B and α2C-subtypes), are Gi-coupled receptors. Central 
      activation of brain α2A and α2C-adrenoceptors is the main site for α2-agonist 
      mediated clinical responses in hypertension, ADHD, muscle spasm and ITU 
      management of sedation, reduction in opiate requirements, nausea and delirium. 
      However, despite having the same Gi-potency in functional assays, some 
      α2-agonists also stimulate Gs-responses whilst others do not. This was 
      investigated. Agonist responses to 49 different α-agonists were studied (CRE-gene 
      transcription, cAMP, ERK1/2-phosphorylation and binding affinity) in CHO cells 
      stably expressing the human α2A, α2B or α2C-adrenoceptor, enabling ligand 
      intrinsic efficacy to be determined (binding K(D) /Gi-IC(50) ). Ligands with high 
      intrinsic efficacy (e.g., brimonidine and moxonidine at α2A) stimulated biphasic 
      (Gi-Gs) concentration responses, however for ligands with low intrinsic efficacy 
      (e.g., naphazoline), responses were monophasic (Gi-only). ERK1/2-phosphorylation 
      responses appeared to be Gi-mediated. For Gs-mediated responses to be observed, 
      both a system with high receptor reserve and high agonist intrinsic efficacy were 
      required. From the Gi-mediated efficacy ratio, the degree of Gs-coupling could be 
      predicted. The clinical relevance and precise receptor conformational changes 
      that occur, given the structural diversity of compounds with high intrinsic 
      efficacy, remains to be determined. Comparison with α1 and β1/β2-adrenoceptors 
      demonstrated subclass affinity selectivity for some compounds (e.g., 
      α2:dexmedetomidine, α1:A61603) whilst e.g., oxymetazoline had high affinity for 
      both α2A and α1A-subtypes, compared to all others. Some compounds had subclass 
      selectivity due to selective intrinsic efficacy (e.g., α2:brimonidine, 
      α1:methoxamine/etilefrine). A detailed knowledge of these agonist characteristics 
      is vital for improving computer-based deep-learning and drug design.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the emergence of the concept of value-based care, efficient 
      resource allocation has become an increasingly prominent factor in surgical 
      decision-making. Validated machine learning (ML) models for cost prediction in 
      outpatient spine surgery are limited. As such, we developed and internally 
      validated a supervised ML algorithm to reliably identify cost drivers associated 
      with ambulatory single-level lumbar decompression surgery. METHODS: A 
      retrospective review of the New York State Ambulatory Surgical Database was 
      performed to identify patients who underwent single-level lumbar decompression 
      from 2014 to 2015. Patients with a length of stay of >0 were excluded. Using pre- 
      and intraoperative parameters (features) derived from the New York State 
      Ambulatory Surgical Database, an optimal supervised ML model was ultimately 
      developed and internally validated after 5 candidate models were rigorously 
      tested, trained, and compared for predictive performance related to total 
      charges. The best performing model was then evaluated by testing its performance 
      on identifying relationships between features of interest and cost prediction. 
      Finally, the best performing algorithm was entered into an open-access web 
      application. RESULTS: A total of 8402 patients were included. The 
      gradient-boosted ensemble model demonstrated the best performance assessed via 
      internal validation. Major cost drivers included anesthesia type, operating room 
      time, race, patient income and insurance status, community type, worker's 
      compensation status, and comorbidity index. CONCLUSIONS: The gradient-boosted 
      ensemble model predicted total charges and associated cost drivers associated 
      with ambulatory single-level lumbar decompression using a large, statewide 
      database with excellent performance. External validation of this algorithm in 
      future studies may guide practical application of this clinical tool.

AB  - Pain assessment represents the first fundamental stage for proper pain 
      management, but currently, methods applied in clinical practice often lack in 
      providing a satisfying characterization of the pain experience. Automatic methods 
      based on the analysis of physiological signals (e.g., photoplethysmography, 
      electrodermal activity) promise to overcome these limitations, also providing the 
      possibility to record these signals through wearable devices, thus capturing the 
      physiological response in everyday life. After applying preprocessing, feature 
      extraction and feature selection methods, we tested several machine learning 
      algorithms to develop an automatic classifier fed with physiological signals 
      recorded in real-world contexts and pain ratings from 21 cancer patients. The 
      best algorithm achieved up to 72% accuracy. Although performance can be improved 
      by enlarging the dataset, preliminary results proved the feasibility of assessing 
      pain by using physiological signals recorded in real-world contexts.

AB  - Appropriate prescription of pain medication is challenging because pain is 
      difficult to quantify due to the subjectiveness of pain assessment. Currently, 
      clinicians must entirely rely on pain scales based on patients' assessments. This 
      has been alleged to be one of the causes of drug overdose and addiction, and a 
      contributor to the opioid crisis. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for 
      objective pain assessment. Furthermore, as pain can occur anytime and anywhere, 
      ambulatory pain monitoring would be welcomed in practice. In our previous study, 
      we developed electrodermal activity (EDA)-derived indices and implemented them in 
      a smartphone application that can communicate via Bluetooth to an EDA wearable 
      device. While we previously showed high accuracy for high-level pain detection, 
      multi-level pain detection has not been demonstrated. In this paper, we tested 
      our smartphone application with a multi-level pain-induced dataset. The dataset 
      was collected from fifteen subjects who underwent four levels of pain-inducing 
      electrical pulse (EP) stimuli. We then performed statistical analyses and 
      machine-learning techniques to classify multiple pain levels. Significant 
      differences were observed in our EDA-derived indices among no-pain, low-pain, and 
      high-pain segments. A random forest classifier showed 62.6% for the balanced 
      accuracy, and a random forest regressor exhibited 0.441 for the coefficient of 
      determination. Clinical Relevance - This is one of the first studies to present a 
      smartphone application for detecting multiple levels of pain in real time using 
      an EDA wearable device. This work shows the feasibility of ambulatory pain 
      monitoring which can potentially be useful for chronic pain management.

TI  - Association between post-operative delirium and use of volatile anesthetics in

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Early post-operative delirium is a common perioperative 
      complication in the post anesthesia care unit. To date it is unknown if a 
      specific anesthetic regime can affect the incidence of delirium after surgery. 
      Our objective was to examine the effect of volatile anesthetics on post-operative 
      delirium. DESIGN: Single Center Observational Study. SETTING: Post Anesthesia 
      Care Units at a German tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: 30,075 patients 
      receiving general anesthesia for surgery. MEASUREMENTS: Delirium was assessed 
      with the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale at the end of the recovery period. 
      Subgroup-specific effects of volatile anesthetics on post-operative delirium were 
      estimated using generalized-linear-model trees with inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting. We further assessed the age-specific effect of volatiles 
      using logistic regression models. MAIN RESULTS: Out of 30,075 records, 956 
      patients (3.2%) developed delirium in the post anesthesia care unit. On average, 
      patients who developed delirium were older than patients without delirium. We 
      found volatile anesthetics to increase the risk (Odds exp. (B) for delirium in 
      the elderly 1.8-fold compared to total intravenous anesthesia. Odds increases 
      with unplanned surgery 3.0-fold. In the very old (87 years or older), the 
      increase in delirium is 6.2-fold. This result was confirmed with internal 
      validation and in a logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Our exploratory study 
      indicates that early postoperative delirium is associated with the use of 
      volatile anesthetics especially in the sub-cohort of patients aged 75 years and 
      above. Further studies should include both volatile and intravenous anesthetics 
      to find the ideal anesthetic in elderly patients.

AB  - An acute hypotensive episode (AHE) can lead to severe consequences and 
      complications that threaten patients' lives within a short period of time. How to 
      accurately and non-invasively predict AHE in advance has become a hot clinical 
      topic that has attracted a lot of attention in the medical and engineering 
      communities. In the last 20 years, with rapid advancements in machine learning 
      methodology, this topic has been viewed from a different perspective. This review 
      paper examines studies published from 2008 to 2021 that evaluated the performance 
      of various machine learning algorithms developed to predict AHE. A total of 437 
      articles were found in four databases that were searched, and 35 full-text 
      articles were included in this review. Fourteen machine learning algorithms were 
      assessed in these 35 articles; the Support Vector Machine algorithm was studied 
      in 12 articles, followed by Logistic Regression (six articles) and Artificial 
      Neural Network (six articles). The accuracy of the algorithms ranged from 70 to 
      96%. The size of the study sample varied from small (12 subjects) to very large 
      (3,825 subjects). Recommendations for future work are also discussed in this 
      review.

TI  - Machine learning-assisted fluoroscopy of bladder function in awake mice.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.79378 [doi]
LID - e79378
AB  - Understanding the lower urinary tract (LUT) and development of highly needed 
      novel therapies to treat LUT disorders depends on accurate techniques to monitor 
      LUT (dys)function in preclinical models. We recently developed videocystometry in 
      rodents, which combines intravesical pressure measurements with X-ray-based 
      fluoroscopy of the LUT, allowing the in vivo analysis of the process of urine 
      storage and voiding with unprecedented detail. Videocystometry relies on the 
      precise contrast-based determination of the bladder volume at high temporal 
      resolution, which can readily be achieved in anesthetized or otherwise 
      motion-restricted mice but not in awake and freely moving animals. To overcome 
      this limitation, we developed a machine-learning method, in which we trained a 
      neural network to automatically detect the bladder in fluoroscopic images, 
      allowing the automatic analysis of bladder filling and voiding cycles based on 
      large sets of time-lapse fluoroscopic images (>3 hr at 30 images/s) from behaving 
      mice and in a noninvasive manner. With this approach, we found that urethane, an 
      injectable anesthetic that is commonly used in preclinical urological research, 
      has a profound, dose-dependent effect on urethral relaxation and voiding 
      duration. Moreover, both in awake and in anesthetized mice, the bladder capacity 
      was decreased ~fourfold when cystometry was performed acutely after surgical 
      implantation of a suprapubic catheter. Our findings provide a paradigm for the 
      noninvasive, in vivo monitoring of a hollow organ in behaving animals and 
      pinpoint important limitations of the current gold standard techniques to study 
      the LUT in mice.

OAB - Healthy adults empty their bladder many times a day with little thought. This 
      seemingly simple process requires communication between the lower urinary tract 
      and the central nervous system. About one in five adults experience conditions 
      like urinary incontinence, urgency, or bladder pain caused by impairments in 
      their lower urinary tract. Despite the harmful effects these conditions have on 
      people’s health and well-being, few good treatments are available. Mice are often 
      used to study lower urinary tract conditions and treatments. One common technique 
      is to fill a mouse’s bladder using a catheter and measure changes in pressure as 
      the bladder empties and refills. But these procedures and the anesthesia used 
      during them may affect bladder function and skew results. Here, De Bruyn et al. 
      have developed a new technique that allows scientists to measure bladder function 
      in awake, freely moving mice. The mice’s bladders were photographed using a 
      specialized X-ray based fluoroscope that captured 30 images per second over the 
      course of three hours. A machine learning algorithm was then applied which can 
      automatically detect the circumference of the bladder in each captured image 
      (over 30,000 in total) and quantify its volume. This makes it is possible to 
      measure the bladder as it empties and fills even if the mice move between time 
      frames. The new approach showed that ‘gold standard’ commonly used methods have a 
      profound effect on the bladder. Surgical implantation of a catheter reduced the 
      bladder to a quarter of its capacity. In addition, one of the most widely used 
      anesthetic drugs in urinary tract research was found to affect the bladder’s 
      ability to drain. The technique created by De Bruyn et al. provides a new way to 
      study lower urinary tract function and disease in awake, moving animals. This 
      tool would be easy for other academic and pharmaceutical laboratories to 
      implement, and may help scientists discover new therapies for lower urinary tract 
      conditions.

AB  - Anesthesia drug overdose hazards and lack of gold standards in anesthesia 
      monitoring lead to an urgent need for accurate anesthesia drug detection. To 
      investigate the PPG waveform features affected by anesthesia drugs and develop a 
      machine-learning classifier with high anesthesia drug sensitivity. This study 
      used 64 anesthesia and non-anesthesia patient data (32 cases each), extracted 
      from Queensland and MIMIC-II databases, respectively. The key waveform features 
      (total area, rising time, width 75%, 50%, and 25%) were extracted from 16,310 
      signal recordings (5-s duration). Discriminant analysis, support vector machine 
      (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) were evaluated by splitting the dataset into 
      halve training (11 patients, 8570 segments) and halve testing dataset (11 
      patients, 7740 segments). Significant differences exist between PPG waveform 
      features of anesthesia and non-anesthesia groups (p < 0.05) except total area 
      feature (p > 0.05). The KNN classifier achieved 91.7% (AUC = 0.95) anesthesia 
      detection accuracy with the highest sensitivity (0.88) and specificity (0.90) as 
      compared to other classifiers. Kohen's kappa also shows almost perfect agreement 
      (0.79) with the KNN classifier. The KNN classifier trained with significant PPG 
      features has the potential to be used as a reliable, non-invasive, and low-cost 
      method for the detection of anesthesia drugs for depth analysis during surgical 
      operations and postoperative monitoring.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the perceived impact of 
      artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies (ET) on various 
      specialties by medical students in both 2017 and 2021 and how this might affect 
      their residency selections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a brief, 
      anonymous survey of all medical students at a single institution in 2017 and 
      2021. Survey questions evaluated (1) incentives motivating residency selection 
      and career path, (2) degree of interest in each specialty, (3) perceived effect 
      that ET will have on job prospects for each specialty, and (4) those specialties 
      that students would not consider because of concerns regarding ET. RESULTS: A 
      total of 72% (384/532) and 54% (321/598) of medical students participated in the 
      survey in 2017 and 2021, respectively, and results were largely stable. Students 
      perceived ET would reduce job prospects for pathology, diagnostic radiology, and 
      anesthesiology, and enhance prospects for all other specialties (p < 0.01) except 
      dermatology. For both surveys, 23% of students would NOT consider diagnostic 
      radiology because ET would make it obsolete, higher than all other specialties (p 
      < 0.01). Regarding the one student class that was surveyed twice, 50% felt ET 
      would reduce job prospects for radiology in 2017, increasing to 71% in 2021 (p < 
      0.01), and similar percentages-20% in 2017 and 23% in 2021-said they explicitly 
      would not consider radiology because of concerns levied by ET. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Current perceptions of ET likely affect residency selection for a large 
      proportion of medical students and may impact the future of various specialties, 
      particularly diagnostic radiology.

TI  - Artificial intelligence for renal cancer: From imaging to histology and beyond.
PG  - 243-252
LID - 10.1016/j.ajur.2022.05.003 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has made considerable progress within the last 
      decade and is the subject of contemporary literature. This trend is driven by 
      improved computational abilities and increasing amounts of complex data that 
      allow for new approaches in analysis and interpretation. Renal cell carcinoma 
      (RCC) has a rising incidence since most tumors are now detected at an earlier 
      stage due to improved imaging. This creates considerable challenges as 
      approximately 10%-17% of kidney tumors are designated as benign in 
      histopathological evaluation; however, certain co-morbid populations (the obese 
      and elderly) have an increased peri-interventional risk. AI offers an alternative 
      solution by helping to optimize precision and guidance for diagnostic and 
      therapeutic decisions. The narrative review introduced basic principles and 
      provide a comprehensive overview of current AI techniques for RCC. Currently, AI 
      applications can be found in any aspect of RCC management including diagnostics, 
      perioperative care, pathology, and follow-up. Most commonly applied models 
      include neural networks, random forest, support vector machines, and regression. 
      However, for implementation in daily practice, health care providers need to 
      develop a basic understanding and establish interdisciplinary collaborations in 
      order to standardize datasets, define meaningful endpoints, and unify 
      interpretation.

AB  - Background: Although unplanned hospital readmission is an important indicator for 
      monitoring the perioperative quality of hospital care, few published studies of 
      hospital readmission have focused on surgical patient populations, especially in 
      the elderly. We aimed to investigate if machine learning approaches can be used 
      to predict postoperative unplanned 30-day hospital readmission in old surgical 
      patients. Methods: We extracted demographic, comorbidity, laboratory, surgical, 
      and medication data of elderly patients older than 65 who underwent surgeries 
      under general anesthesia in West China Hospital, Sichuan University from July 
      2019 to February 2021. Different machine learning approaches were performed to 
      evaluate whether unplanned 30-day hospital readmission can be predicted. Model 
      performance was assessed using the following metrics: AUC, accuracy, precision, 
      recall, and F1 score. Calibration of predictions was performed using Brier Score. 
      A feature ablation analysis was performed, and the change in AUC with the removal 
      of each feature was then assessed to determine feature importance. Results: A 
      total of 10,535 unique surgeries and 10,358 unique surgical elderly patients were 
      included. The overall 30-day unplanned readmission rate was 3.36%. The AUCs of 
      the six machine learning algorithms predicting postoperative 30-day unplanned 
      readmission ranged from 0.6865 to 0.8654. The RF + XGBoost algorithm overall 
      performed the best with an AUC of 0.8654 (95% CI, 0.8484-0.8824), accuracy of 
      0.9868 (95% CI, 0.9834-0.9902), precision of 0.3960 (95% CI, 0.3854-0.4066), 
      recall of 0.3184 (95% CI, 0.259-0.3778), and F1 score of 0.4909 (95% CI, 
      0.3907-0.5911). The Brier scores of the six machine learning algorithms 
      predicting postoperative 30-day unplanned readmission ranged from 0.3721 to 
      0.0464, with RF + XGBoost showing the best calibration capability. The most five 
      important features of RF + XGBoost were operation duration, white blood cell 
      count, BMI, total bilirubin concentration, and blood glucose concentration. 
      Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms can accurately predict postoperative 
      unplanned 30-day readmission in elderly surgical patients.

TI  - A multicenter prospective study on postoperative pulmonary complications 
      prediction in geriatric patients with deep neural network model.
PG  - 976536
LID - 10.3389/fsurg.2022.976536 [doi]
LID - 976536
AB  - AIM: Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) can increase the risk of 
      postoperative mortality, and the geriatric population has high incidence of PPCs. 
      Early identification of high-risk geriatric patients is of great value for 
      clinical decision making and prognosis improvement. Existing prediction models 
      are based purely on structured data, and they lack predictive accuracy in 
      geriatric patients. We aimed to develop and validate a deep neural network model 
      based on combined natural language data and structured data for improving the 
      prediction of PPCs in geriatric patients. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled 
      patients aged ≥65 years who underwent surgery under general anesthesia at seven 
      hospitals in China. Data from the West China Hospital of Sichuan University were 
      used as the derivation dataset, and a deep neural network model was developed 
      based on combined natural language data and structured data. Data from the six 
      other hospitals were combined for external validation. RESULTS: The derivation 
      dataset included 12,240 geriatric patients, and 1949(15.9%) patients developed 
      PPCs. Our deep neural network model outperformed other machine learning models 
      with an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.657(95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.655-0.658) and an area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.884(95% CI, 0.883-0.885). The external dataset 
      included 7579 patients, and 776(10.2%) patients developed PPCs. In external 
      validation, the AUPRC was 0.632(95%CI, 0.632-0.633) and the AUROC was 
      0.889(95%CI, 0.888-0.889). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the deep neural 
      network model based on combined natural language data and structured data could 
      improve the prediction of PPCs in geriatric patients.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Based Pain Assessment Technology in Clinical Application 
      of Real-World Neonatal Blood Sampling.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12081831 [doi]
LID - 1831
AB  - Background: Accurate neonatal pain assessment (NPA) is the key to neonatal pain 
      management, yet it is a challenging task for medical staff. This study aimed to 
      analyze the clinical practicability of the artificial intelligence based NPA 
      (AI-NPA) tool for real-world blood sampling. Method: We performed a prospective 
      study to analyze the consistency of the NPA results given by a self-developed 
      automated NPA system and nurses’ on-site NPAs (OS-NPAs) for 232 newborns during 
      blood sampling in neonatal wards, where the neonatal infant pain scale (NIPS) was 
      used for evaluation. Spearman correlation analysis and the degree of agreement of 
      the pain score and pain grade derived by the NIPS were applied for statistical 
      analysis. Results: Taking the OS-NPA results as the gold standard, the accuracies 
      of the NIPS pain score and pain grade given by the automated NPA system were 
      88.79% and 95.25%, with kappa values of 0.92 and 0.90 (p < 0.001), respectively. 
      Conclusion: The results of the automated NPA system for real-world neonatal blood 
      sampling are highly consistent with the results of the OS-NPA. Considering the 
      great advantages of automated NPA systems in repeatability, efficiency, and cost, 
      it is worth popularizing the AI technique in NPA for precise and efficient 
      neonatal pain management.

AB  - Drug efficacy can be improved by understanding the effects of anesthesia on the 
      neurovascular system. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to 
      predict the risk of infection in postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) patients 
      who are on non-mechanical ventilation and are receiving hydromorphone analgesia. 
      In this retrospective study, 130 patients were divided into high and low dose 
      groups of hydromorphone analgesic pump patients admitted after surgery. The white 
      blood cells (WBC) count and incidence rate of infection was significantly higher 
      in the high hydromorphone dosage group compared to the low hydromorphone dosage 
      groups (p < 0.05). Furthermore, significant differences in age (P = 0.006), body 
      mass index (BMI) (P = 0.001), WBC count (P = 0.019), C-reactive protein (CRP) (P 
      = 0.038), hydromorphone dosage (P = 0.014), and biological sex (P = 0.024) were 
      seen between the infected and non-infected groups. The infected group also had a 
      longer hospital stay and an extended stay in the intensive care unit compared to 
      the non-infected group. We identified important risk factors for the development 
      of postoperative infections by using machine learning algorithms, including 
      hydromorphone dosage, age, biological sex, BMI, and WBC count. Logistic 
      regression analysis was applied to incorporate these variables to construct 
      infection prediction models and nomograms. The area under curves (AUC) of the 
      model were 0.835, 0.747, and 0.818 in the training group, validation group, and 
      overall pairwise column group, respectively. Therefore, we determined that 
      hydromorphone dosage, age, biological sex, BMI, WBC count, and CRP are 
      significant risk factors in developing postoperative infections.

TI  - Reduced postoperative pain in patients receiving nociception monitor guided 
      analgesia during elective major abdominal surgery: a randomized, controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 481-491
LID - 10.1007/s10877-022-00906-1 [doi]
AB  - The Nociception Level index (NOL™) is a multiparameter index, based on artificial 
      intelligence for the monitoring of nociception during anesthesia. We studied the 
      influence of NOL-guided analgesia on postoperative pain scores in patients 
      undergoing major abdominal surgery during sevoflurane/fentanyl anesthesia. This 
      study was designed as a single-center, prospective randomized, controlled study. 
      After Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent, 75 ASA 
      1-3 adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, were randomized to 
      NOL-guided fentanyl dosing (NOL) or standard care (SOC) and completed the study. 
      The sevoflurane target MAC range was 0.8-1.2. In the NOL-guided group (N = 36), 
      when NOL values were > 25 for at least 1 min, a weight adjusted fentanyl bolus 
      was administered. In the control group (N = 39) fentanyl administration was based 
      on hemodynamic indices and clinician judgement. After surgery, pain, was 
      evaluated using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scale, ranging from 0 to 
      10, at 15 min intervals for 180 min or until patient discharge from the PACU. 
      Median postoperative pain scores reported were 3.0 [interquartile range 0.0-5.0] 
      and 5.0 [3.0-6.0] at 90 min in NOL-guided and control groups respectively 
      (Bootstrap corrected actual difference 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.4-2.6). 
      There was no difference in postoperative morphine consumption or intraoperative 
      fentanyl consumption. Postoperative pain scores were significantly improved in 
      nociception level index-guided patients. We attribute this to more objective 
      fentanyl dosing when timed to actual nociceptive stimuli during anesthesia, 
      contributing to lower levels of sympathetic activation and surgical stress.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases are responsible for substantial morbidity 
      and mortality worldwide, including colorectal cancer, which has shown a rising 
      incidence among adults younger than 50. Although this could be alleviated by 
      regular screening, only a small percentage of those at risk are screened 
      comprehensively, due to shortcomings in accuracy and patient acceptance. To 
      address these challenges, we designed an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered 
      wireless video endoscopic capsule that surpasses the performance of the existing 
      solutions by featuring, among others: (1) real-time image processing using 
      onboard deep neural networks (DNN), (2) enhanced visualization of the mucous 
      layer by deploying both white-light and narrow-band imaging, (3) on-the-go task 
      modification and DNN update using over-the-air-programming and (4) bi-directional 
      communication with patient's personal electronic devices to report important 
      findings. We tested our solution in an in vivo setting, by administrating our 
      endoscopic capsule to a pig under general anesthesia. All novel features, 
      successfully implemented on a single platform, were validated. Our study lays the 
      groundwork for clinically implementing a new generation of endoscopic capsules, 
      which will significantly improve early diagnosis of upper and lower GI tract 
      diseases.

AB  - Perioperative cardiac arrest (POCA) is associated with a high mortality rate. 
      This work aimed to study its prognostic factors for risk mitigation by means of 
      care management and planning. A database of 380,919 surgeries was reviewed, and 
      150 POCAs were curated. The main outcome was mortality prior to hospital 
      discharge. Patient demographic, medical history, and clinical characteristics 
      (anesthesia and surgery) were the main features. Six machine learning (ML) 
      algorithms, including LR, SVC, RF, GBM, AdaBoost, and VotingClassifier, were 
      explored. The last algorithm was an ensemble of the first five algorithms. k-fold 
      cross-validation and bootstrapping minimized the prediction bias and variance, 
      respectively. Explainers (SHAP and LIME) were used to interpret the predictions. 
      The ensemble provided the most accurate and robust predictions (AUC = 0.90 [95% 
      CI, 0.78-0.98]) across various age groups. The risk factors were identified by 
      order of importance. Surprisingly, the comorbidity of hypertension was found to 
      have a protective effect on survival, which was reported by a recent study for 
      the first time to our knowledge. The validated ensemble classifier in aid of the 
      explainers improved the predictive differentiation, thereby deepening our 
      understanding of POCA prognostication. It offers a holistic model-based approach 
      for personalized anesthesia and surgical treatment.

TI  - A novel ultrasound software system for lumbar level identification in obstetric 
      patients.
PG  - 1211-1219
LID - 10.1007/s12630-022-02300-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Using machine learning, we developed a proprietary ultrasound software 
      called the Spine Level Identification (SLIDE) system, which automatically 
      identifies lumbar landmarks in real time as the operator slides the transducer 
      over the lumber spine. Here, we assessed the agreement between SLIDE and manual 
      palpation and traditional lumbar ultrasound (LUS) for determining the primary 
      target L3-4 interspace. METHODS: Upon institutional ethics approval and informed 
      consent, 76 healthy term parturients scheduled for elective Caesarean delivery 
      were recruited. The L3-4 interspace was identified by manual palpation and then 
      by the SLIDE method. The reference standard was located using traditional LUS by 
      an experienced operator. The primary outcome was the L3-4 interspace 
      identification agreement of manual palpation and SLIDE with the reference 
      standard, as percentage agreement and Gwet's agreement coefficient (AC1). 
      RESULTS: The raw agreement was 70% with Gwet's agreement coefficient (AC1) = 0.59 
      (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.77) for manual palpation and 84% with 
      Gwet's AC1 = 0.82 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.93) for SLIDE. When the levels differ from 
      the reference, the manual palpation method identified L2-3 more often than L4-5 
      while the SLIDE method identified equally above or below L3-4. The SLIDE system 
      had greater agreement than palpation in locating L3-4 and all other lumber 
      interspaces after controlling for body mass index (adjusted odds ratio, 2.99; 95% 
      CI, 1.21 to 8.7; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The SLIDE system had higher agreement 
      with traditional ultrasound than manual palpation did in identifying L3-4 and all 
      other lumber interspaces after adjusting for BMI in healthy term obstetric 
      patients. Future studies should examine factors that affect agreement and ways to 
      improve SLIDE for clinical integration. STUDY REGISTRATION: www. CLINICALTRIALS:

      clinical anesthetic practice, and to describe the current state of the research 
      in the field. AI is a general term which refers to all the techniques that enable 
      computers to mimic human intelligence. AI is based on algorithms that gives 
      machines the ability to reason and perform functions such as problem-solving, 
      object and word recognition, inference of world states, and decision-making. It 
      includes machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). METHODS: We performed a 
      narrative review of the literature on Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane databases. The 
      research string comprised various combinations of "artificial intelligence", 
      "machine learning", "anesthesia", "anesthesiology". The databases were searched 
      independently by two authors. A third reviewer would mediate any disagreement the 
      results of the two screeners. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: The application of AI has 
      shown excellent results in both anesthesia and in operating room (OR) management. 
      In each phase of the perioperative process, pre-, intra- and postoperative ones, 
      it is able to perform different and specific tasks, using various techniques. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Thanks to the use of these new technologies, even anesthesia, as it 
      is happening for other disciplines, is going through a real revolution, called 
      Anesthesia 4.0. However, AI is not free from limitations and open issues. 
      Unfortunately, the models created, provided they have excellent performance, have 
      not yet entered daily practice. Clinical impact analyzes and external validations 
      are needed before this happens. Therefore, qualitative research will be needed to 
      better understand the ethical, cultural, and societal implications of integrating 
      AI into clinical workflows.

TI  - Artificial intelligence enhanced ultrasound (AI-US) in a severe obese parturient: 
      a case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuraxial anesthesia in obese parturients can be challenging due to 
      anatomical and physiological modifications secondary to pregnancy; this led to 
      growing popularity of spine ultrasound in this population for easing landmark 
      identification and procedure execution. Integration of Artificial Intelligence 
      with ultrasound (AI-US) for image enhancement and analysis has increased 
      clinicians' ability to localize vertebral structures in patients with challenging 
      anatomical conformation. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a parturient 
      with extremely severe obesity, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) = 64.5 kg/m(2), in 
      which the AI-Enabled Image Recognition allowed a successful placing of an 
      epidural catheter. CONCLUSIONS: Benefits gained from AI-US implementation are 
      multiple: immediate recognition of anatomical structures leads to increased 
      first-attempt success rate, making easier the process of spinal anesthesia 
      execution compared to traditional palpation methods, reducing needle placement 
      time for spinal anesthesia and predicting best needle direction and target 
      structure depth in peridural anesthesia.

TI  - Development a novel robust method to enhance the solubility of Oxaprozin as 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug based on machine-learning.

AB  - Accurate specification of the drugs' solubility is known as an important activity 
      to appropriately manage the supercritical impregnation process. Over the last 
      decades, the application of supercritical fluids (SCFs), mainly CO(2), has found 
      great interest as a promising solution to dominate the limitations of traditional 
      methods including high toxicity, difficulty of control, high expense and low 
      stability. Oxaprozin is an efficient off-patent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drug (NSAID), which is being extensively used for the pain management of patients 
      suffering from chronic musculoskeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. In 
      this paper, the prominent purpose of the authors is to predict and consequently 
      optimize the solubility of Oxaprozin inside the CO(2)SCF. To do this, the authors 
      employed two basic models and improved them with the Adaboost ensemble method. 
      The base models include Gaussian process regression (GPR) and decision tree (DT). 
      We optimized and evaluated the hyper-parameters of them using standard metrics. 
      Boosted DT has an MAE error rate, an R2-score, and an MAPE of 6.806E-05, 0.980, 
      and 4.511E-01, respectively. Also, boosted GPR has an R2-score of 0.998 and its 
      MAPE error is 3.929E-02, and with MAE it has an error rate of 5.024E-06. So, 
      boosted GPR was chosen as the best model, and the best values were: 
      (T = 3.38E + 02, P = 4.0E + 02, Solubility = 0.001241).

TI  - The early outcomes of complex abdominal wall reconstruction with polyvinylidene 
      (PVDF) mesh in the setting of active infection: a prospective series.
PG  - 3089-3099
LID - 10.1007/s00423-022-02625-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The use of synthetic mesh to repair infected abdominal wall defects 
      remains controversial. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh was introduced in 2002 
      as an alternative to polypropylene, with the advantages of improved biostability, 
      lowered bending stiffness, and minimum tissue response. This study aimed to 
      evaluate the short-term outcomes of using PVDF mesh to treat infected abdominal 
      wall defects in the elective setting. METHODS: This prospective clinical trial 
      started in 2016 and was designed to evaluate the short- and mid-term outcomes of 
      38 patients submitted to abdominal wall reconstruction in the setting of active 
      mesh infection and/or enteric fistulas (AI) when compared to a group of 38 
      patients submitted to clean ventral hernia repairs (CC). Patients were submitted 
      to single-staged repairs, using onlay PVDF mesh (DynaMesh®-CICAT) reinforcement 
      to treat their defects. RESULTS: Groups had comparable demographic 
      characteristics. The AI group had more previous abdominal operations and required 
      a longer operative and anesthesia time. At 30 days, surgical site occurrences 
      were observed in 16 (42.1%) AI vs. 17 (44.7%) CC, p = 0.817; surgical site 
      infection occurred in 4 (10.5%) AI vs. 6 (15.8%) CC, p = 0.497; and a higher 
      number of procedural interventions were required in the CC group, 15.8 AI vs. 
      28.9% CC, p = 0.169. Both groups did not have chronic infections at 1 year of 
      follow-up, and one hernia recurrence was observed in the AI group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The use of PVDF mesh in the infected setting presented favorable results with a 
      low incidence of wound infection.

TI  - Comparison of Deep Learning Algorithms in Predicting Expert Assessments of Pain 
      Scores during Surgical Operations Using Analgesia Nociception Index.
LID - 10.3390/s22155496 [doi]
LID - 5496
AB  - There are many surgical operations performed daily in operation rooms worldwide. 
      Adequate anesthesia is needed during an operation. Besides hypnosis, adequate 
      analgesia is critical to prevent autonomic reactions. Clinical experience and 
      vital signs are usually used to adjust the dosage of analgesics. Analgesia 
      nociception index (ANI), which ranges from 0 to 100, is derived from heart rate 
      variability (HRV) via electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, for pain evaluation in a 
      non-invasive manner. It represents parasympathetic activity. In this study, we 
      compared the performance of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term 
      memory (LSTM) algorithms in predicting expert assessment of pain score (EAPS) 
      based on patient's HRV during surgery. The objective of this study was to analyze 
      how deep learning models differed from the medical doctors' predictions of EAPS. 
      As the input and output features of the deep learning models, the opposites of 
      ANI and EAPS were used. This study included 80 patients who underwent operations 
      at National Taiwan University Hospital. Using MLP and LSTM, a holdout method was 
      first applied to 60 training patients, 10 validation patients, and 10 testing 
      patients. As compared to the LSTM model, which had a testing mean absolute error 
      (MAE) of 2.633 ± 0.542, the MLP model had a testing MAE of 2.490 ± 0.522, with a 
      more appropriate shape of its prediction curves. The model based on MLP was 
      selected as the best. Using MLP, a seven-fold cross validation method was then 
      applied. The first fold had the lowest testing MAE of 2.460 ± 0.634, while the 
      overall MAE for the seven-fold cross validation method was 2.848 ± 0.308. In 
      conclusion, HRV analysis using MLP algorithm had a good correlation with EAPS; 
      therefore, it can play role as a continuous monitor to predict intraoperative 
      pain levels, to assist physicians in adjusting analgesic agent dosage. Further 
      studies may consider obtaining more input features, such as photoplethysmography 
      (PPG) and other kinds of continuous variable, to improve the prediction 
      performance.

TI  - Aiding the prescriber: developing a machine learning approach to personalized 
      risk modeling for chronic opioid therapy amongst US Army soldiers.
PG  - 649-665
LID - 10.1007/s10729-022-09605-4 [doi]
AB  - The opioid epidemic is a major policy concern. The widespread availability of 
      opioids, which is fueled by physician prescribing patterns, medication diversion, 
      and the interaction with potential illicit opioid use, has been implicated as 
      proximal cause for subsequent opioid dependence and mortality. Risk indicators 
      related to chronic opioid therapy (COT) at the point of care may influence 
      physicians' prescribing decisions, potentially reducing rates of dependency and 
      abuse. In this paper, we investigate the performance of machine learning 
      algorithms for predicting the risk of COT. Using data on over 12 million 
      observations of active duty US Army soldiers, we apply machine learning models to 
      predict the risk of COT in the initial months of prescription. We use the area 
      under the curve (AUC) as an overall measure of model performance, and we focus on 
      the positive predictive value (PPV), which reflects the models' ability to 
      accurately target military members for intervention. Of the many models tested, 
      AUC ranges between 0.83 and 0.87. When we focus on the top 1% of members at 
      highest risk, we observe a PPV value of 8.4% and 20.3% for months 1 and 3, 
      respectively. We further investigate the performance of sparse models that can be 
      implemented in sparse data environments. We find that when the goal is to 
      identify patients at the highest risk of chronic use, these sparse linear models 
      achieve a performance similar to models trained on hundreds of variables. Our 
      predictive models exhibit high accuracy and can alert prescribers to the risk of 
      COT for the highest risk patients. Optimized sparse models identify a 
      parsimonious set of factors to predict COT: initial supply of opioids, the supply 
      of opioids in the month being studied, and the number of prescriptions for 
      psychotropic medications. Future research should investigate the possible effects 
      of these tools on prescriber behavior (e.g., the benefit of clinician nudging at 
      the point of care in outpatient settings).

AB  - Perioperative traumatic stress is a systemic nonspecific response caused by 
      stimuli such as anesthesia, surgery, pain and anxiety, which lasts throughout the 
      perioperative period.The continuous excessive stress response is not conducive to 
      the postoperative rehabilitation of patients. Enhanced recovery after surgery 
      (ERAS), a research hotspot of modern surgery, can significantly reduce 
      perioperative pain and stress, thus promoting the rehabilitation of patients. 
      With the progress of artificial intelligence and information technology, 
      wearable, non-invasive, real-time heart rate variability (HRV) dynamic monitoring 
      can effectively realize the digitalization of stress monitoring with low price, 
      which is worthy of clinical application. Therefore, the use of HRV for digital 
      monitoring of perioperative stress has a significant research value. Moreover, 
      the combination of HRV and ERAS has shown its advantages and the prospect of 
      clinical application is worthy of anticipating.

TI  - Identification of Preanesthetic History Elements by a Natural Language Processing 
      Engine.
PG  - 1162-1171
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000006152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methods that can automate, support, and streamline the preanesthesia 
      evaluation process may improve resource utilization and efficiency. Natural 
      language processing (NLP) involves the extraction of relevant information from 
      unstructured text data. We describe the utilization of a clinical NLP pipeline 
      intended to identify elements relevant to preoperative medical history by 
      analyzing clinical notes. We hypothesize that the NLP pipeline would identify a 
      significant portion of pertinent history captured by a perioperative provider. 
      METHODS: For each patient, we collected all pertinent notes from the 
      institution's electronic medical record that were available no later than 1 day 
      before their preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment. Pertinent notes included 
      free-text notes consisting of history and physical, consultation, outpatient, 
      inpatient progress, and previous preanesthetic evaluation notes. The free-text 
      notes were processed by a Named Entity Recognition pipeline, an NLP machine 
      learning model trained to recognize and label spans of text that corresponded to 
      medical concepts. These medical concepts were then mapped to a list of medical 
      conditions that were of interest for a preanesthesia evaluation. For each 
      condition, we calculated the percentage of time across all patients in which (1) 
      the NLP pipeline and the anesthesiologist both captured the condition; (2) the 
      NLP pipeline captured the condition but the anesthesiologist did not; and (3) the 
      NLP pipeline did not capture the condition but the anesthesiologist did. RESULTS: 
      A total of 93 patients were included in the NLP pipeline input. Free-text notes 
      were extracted from the electronic medical record of these patients for a total 
      of 9765 notes. The NLP pipeline and anesthesiologist agreed in 81.24% of 
      instances on the presence or absence of a specific condition. The NLP pipeline 
      identified information that was not noted by the anesthesiologist in 16.57% of 
      instances and did not identify a condition that was noted by the 
      anesthesiologist's review in 2.19% of instances. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that utilization of NLP produced an 
      output that identified medical conditions relevant to preanesthetic evaluation 
      from unstructured free-text input. Automation of risk stratification tools may 
      provide clinical decision support or recommend additional preoperative testing or 
      evaluation. Future studies are needed to integrate these tools into clinical 
      workflows and validate its efficacy.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop machine learning (ML) models to predict 
      hospital admission (overnight stay) as well as short-term complications and 
      readmission rates following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). 
      Furthermore, we sought to compare the ML models with logistic regression models 
      in predicting ACLR outcomes. METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National 
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for patients who 
      underwent elective ACLR from 2012 to 2018. Artificial neural network ML and 
      logistic regression models were developed to predict overnight stay, 30-day 
      postoperative complications, and ACL-related readmission, and model performance 
      was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. 
      Regression analyses were used to identify variables that were significantly 
      associated with the predicted outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 21,636 elective ACLR 
      cases met inclusion criteria. Variables associated with hospital admission 
      included White race, obesity, hypertension, and American Society of 
      Anesthesiologists classification 3 and greater, anesthesia other than general, 
      prolonged operative time, and inpatient setting. The incidence of hospital 
      admission (overnight stay) was 10.2%, 30-day complications was 1.3%, and 30-day 
      readmission for ACLR-related causes was 0.9%. Compared with logistic regression 
      models, artificial neural network models reported superior area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve values in predicting overnight stay 
      (0.835 vs 0.589), 30-day complications (0.742 vs 0.590), reoperation (0.842 vs 
      0.601), ACLR-related readmission (0.872 vs 0.606), deep-vein thrombosis (0.804 vs 
      0.608), and surgical-site infection (0.818 vs 0.596). CONCLUSIONS: The ML models 
      developed in this study demonstrate an application of ML in which data from a 
      national surgical patient registry was used to predict hospital admission and 
      30-day postoperative complications after elective ACLR. ML models developed 
      performed well, outperforming regression models in predicting hospital admission 
      and short-term complications following elective ACLR. ML models performed best 
      when predicting ACLR-related readmissions and reoperations, followed by overnight 
      stay. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, retrospective comparative prognostic trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The field of machine learning is being employed more and more in 
      medicine. However, studies have shown that the quality of published studies 
      frequently lacks completeness and adherence to published reporting guidelines. 
      This assessment has not been done in the subspecialty of anesthesiology. METHODS: 
      We appraised the quality of reporting of a convenience sample of 67 peer-reviewed 
      publications sourced from the scoping review by Hashimoto et al. Each publication 
      was appraised on the presence of reporting elements (reporting compliance) 
      selected from 4 peer-reviewed guidelines for reporting on machine learning 
      studies. Results are described in several cross sections, including by section of 
      manuscript (e.g. abstract, introduction, etc.), year of publication, impact 
      factor of journal, and impact of publication. RESULTS: On average, reporting 
      compliance was 64% ± 13%. There was marked heterogeneity of reporting based on 
      section of manuscript. There was a mild trend towards increased quality of 
      reporting with increasing impact factor of journal of publication and increasing 
      average number of citations per year since publication, and no trend regarding 
      recency of publication. CONCLUSION: The quality of reporting of machine learning 
      studies in anesthesiology is on par with other fields, but can benefit from 
      improvement, especially in presenting methodology, results, and discussion 
      points, including interpretation of models and pitfalls therein. Clinicians in 
      today's learning health systems will benefit from skills in appraisal of 
      evidence. Several reporting guidelines have been released, and updates to 
      mainstream guidelines are under development, which we hope will usher in 
      improvement in reporting quality.

AB  - The credibility of threshold-based alarms in anesthesia monitors is low and most 
      of the warnings they produce are not informative. This study aims to show that 
      Machine Learning techniques have a potential to generate meaningful alarms during 
      general anesthesia without putting constraints on the type of procedure. Two 
      distinct approaches were tested - Complication Detection and Anomaly Detection. 
      The former is a generic supervised learning problem and for this a simple 
      feed-forward Neural Network performed best. For the latter, we used an 
      Encoder-Decoder Long Short-Term Memory architecture that does not require a large 
      manually-labeled dataset. We show this approach to be more flexible and in the 
      spirit of Explainable Artificial Intelligence, offering greater potential for 
      future improvement.

AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to improve OR efficiency using machine learning (ML) to find 
      relevant metrics influencing surgery time success and team performance on 
      efficiency to create a model which incorporated team, patient, and 
      surgery-related factors. METHODS: From 2012 to 2020, five surgeons, 44 nurses, 
      and 152 anesthesiologists participated in 1199 four joint days (4796 cases): 1461 
      THA, 1496 TKA, 652 HR, 242 UKA, and 945 others. Patients were 2461f:2335 m; age, 
      64.1; BMI, 29.93; and ASA, 2.45. Surgical Success was defined as completing four 
      joints within an eight hour shift using one OR. Time data was recorded 
      prospectively using Surgical Information Management Systems. Hospital records 
      provided team, patient demographics, adverse events, and anesthetic. Data mining 
      identified patterns and relationships in higher dimensions. Predictive analytics 
      used ML ranking algorithm to identify important metrics and created decision tree 
      models for benchmarks and success probability. RESULTS: Five variables predicted 
      success: anaesthesia preparation time, surgical preparation time, time of 
      procedure, anesthesia finish time, and type of joint replacement. The model 
      determined success rate with accuracy of 72% and AUC = 0.72. Probability of 
      success based on mean performance was 77-89% (mean-median) if APT 14-15 minutes, 
      PT 68-70 minutes, AFT four to five minutes, and turnover 25-27 minutes. With the 
      above benchmarks maintained, success rate was 59% if surgeon exceeded 
      71.5-minutes PT or 89% if 64-minutes procedure time or 66% when anesthesiologist 
      spent 17-19.5 minutes on APT. CONCLUSION: AI-ML predicted OR success without 
      increasing resources. Benchmarks track OR performance, demonstrate effects of 
      strategic changes, guide decisions, and provide teamwork improvement 
      opportunities.

TI  - MallesNet: A multi-object assistance based network for brachial plexus 
      segmentation in ultrasound images.

AB  - Ultrasound-guided injection is widely used to help anesthesiologists perform 
      anesthesia in peripheral nerve blockade (PNB). However, it is a daunting task to 
      accurately identify nerve structure in ultrasound images even for the experienced 
      anesthesiologists. In this paper, a Multi-object assistance based Brachial Plexus 
      Segmentation Network, named MallesNet, is proposed to improve the nerve 
      segmentation performance in ultrasound image with the assistance of 
      simultaneously segmenting its surrounding anatomical structures (e.g., muscle, 
      vein, and artery). The MallesNet is designed by following the framework of Mask 
      R-CNN to implement the multi object identification and segmentation. Moreover, a 
      spatial local contrast feature (SLCF) extraction module is proposed to compute 
      contrast features at different scales to effectively obtain useful features for 
      small objects. And the self-attention gate (SAG) is also utilized to capture the 
      spatial relationships in different channels and further re-weight the channels in 
      feature maps by following the design of non-local operation and channel 
      attention. Furthermore, the upsampling mechanism in original Feature Pyramid 
      Network (FPN) is improved by adopting the transpose convolution and skip 
      concatenation to fine-tune the feature maps. The Ultrasound Brachial Plexus 
      Dataset (UBPD) is also proposed to support the research on brachial plexus 
      segmentation, which consists of 1055 ultrasound images with four objects (i.e., 
      nerve, artery, vein and muscle) and their corresponding label masks. Extensive 
      experimental results using UBPD dataset demonstrate that MallesNet can achieve a 
      better segmentation performance on nerves structure and also on surrounding 
      structures in comparison to other competing approaches.

TI  - A Machine Learning Algorithm Outperforms Traditional Multiple Regression to 
      Predict Risk of Unplanned Overnight Stay Following Outpatient Medial 
      Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction.
PG  - e1103-e1110
LID - 10.1016/j.asmr.2022.03.009 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether conventional logistic regression or machine 
      learning algorithms were more precise in identifying the risk factors for 
      unplanned overnight admission after medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) 
      reconstruction. METHODS: A retrospective review of the prospectively collected 
      National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was performed to identify 
      patients who underwent outpatient MPFL reconstruction from 2006-2018. Patients 
      admitted overnight were identified as those with length of stay of 1 or more 
      days. Models were generated using random forest, extreme gradient boosting, 
      adaptive boosting, or elastic net penalized logistic regression, and an 
      additional model was produced as a weighted ensemble of the 4 final algorithms. 
      The predictive capacity of these models was compared to that of logistic 
      regression. RESULTS: Of the 1307 patients identified, 221 (16.9%) required at 
      least one overnight stay after MPFL reconstruction. Multivariate logistic 
      regression found the following variables to be predictors of inpatient admission: 
      age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.02-1.04]; P <.001), 
      spinal anesthesia (OR = 3.42 [95% CI 1.98-6.08]; P < .001), American Society of 
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 3/4 (OR = 1.96 [95% CI 1.25-3.06]; P < .001), 
      history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR = 6.44 [95% CI 
      1.58-26.17]; P = .02), and body mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.05]; P 
      < .001). The ensemble model achieved the best performance based on discrimination 
      assessed via internal validation (area under the curve = 0.722). The variables 
      determined most important by the ensemble model were increasing BMI, increasing 
      age, ASA class, anesthesia, smoking, hypertension, lateral release, and history 
      of COPD. CONCLUSIONS: An internally validated machine learning algorithm 
      outperformed logistic regression modeling in predicting the need for unplanned 
      overnight hospitalization after MPFL reconstruction. In this model, the most 
      significant risk factors for admission were age, BMI, ASA class, smoking status, 
      hypertension, lateral release, and history of COPD. This tool can be deployed to 
      augment provider assessment to identify high-risk candidates and appropriately 
      set postoperative expectations for patients. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Identifying and 
      mitigating patient risk factors to prevent adverse surgical outcomes and 
      hospitalizations is one of our primary goals. There may be a key role for machine 
      learning algorithms to help successfully and efficiently risk stratify patients 
      to decrease costs, appropriately set postoperative expectations, and increase the 
      quality of delivered care.

TI  - Improving Pain Assessment Using Vital Signs and Pain Medication for Patients With 
      Sickle Cell Disease: Retrospective Study.
PG  - e36998
LID - 10.2196/36998 [doi]
LID - e36998
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder 
      affecting millions of people worldwide. Most patients with SCD experience 
      repeated, unpredictable episodes of severe pain. These pain episodes are the 
      leading cause of emergency department visits among patients with SCD and may last 
      for several weeks. Arguably, the most challenging aspect of treating pain 
      episodes in SCD is assessing and interpreting a patient's pain intensity level. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aims to learn deep feature representations of subjective 
      pain trajectories using objective physiological signals collected from electronic 
      health records. METHODS: This study used electronic health record data collected 
      from 496 Duke University Medical Center participants over 5 consecutive years. 
      Each record contained measures for 6 vital signs and the patient's self-reported 
      pain score, with an ordinal range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe and unbearable 
      pain). We also extracted 3 features related to medication: medication type, 
      medication status (given or applied, or missed or removed or due), and total 
      medication dosage (mg/mL). We used variational autoencoders for representation 
      learning and designed machine learning classification algorithms to build pain 
      prediction models. We evaluated our results using an accuracy and confusion 
      matrix and visualized the qualitative data representations. RESULTS: We designed 
      a classification model using raw data and deep representational learning to 
      predict subjective pain scores with average accuracies of 82.8%, 70.6%, 49.3%, 
      and 47.4% for 2-point, 4-point, 6-point, and 11-point pain ratings, respectively. 
      We observed that random forest classification models trained on deep represented 
      features outperformed models trained on unrepresented data for all pain rating 
      scales. We observed that at varying Likert scales, our models performed better 
      when provided with medication data along with vital signs data. We visualized the 
      data representations to understand the underlying latent representations, 
      indicating neighboring representations for similar pain scores with a higher 
      resolution of pain ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that medication 
      information (the type of medication, total medication dosage, and whether the 
      medication was given or missed) can significantly improve subjective pain 
      prediction modeling compared with modeling with only vital signs. This study 
      shows promise in data-driven estimated pain scores that will help clinicians with 
      additional information about the patient's condition, in addition to the 
      patient's self-reported pain scores.

TI  - Development and validation of a machine-learning model for prediction of 
      hypoxemia after extubation in intensive care units.
PG  - 577
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-2118 [doi]
LID - 577
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extubation is the process of removing tracheal tubes so that patients 
      maintain oxygenation while they start to breathe spontaneously. However, 
      hypoxemia after extubation is an important issue for critical care doctors and is 
      associated with patients' oxygenation, circulation, recovery, and incidence of 
      postoperative complications. Accuracy and specificity of most related 
      conventional models remain unsatisfactory. We conducted a predictive analysis 
      based on a supervised machine-learning algorithm for the precise prediction of 
      hypoxemia after extubation in intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: Data were 
      extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
      database for patients over age 18 who underwent mechanical ventilation in the 
      ICU. The primary outcome was hypoxemia after extubation, and it was defined as a 
      partial pressure of oxygen <60 mmHg after extubation. Variables and individuals 
      with missing values greater than 20% were excluded, and the remaining missing 
      values were filled in using multiple imputation. The dataset was split into a 
      training set (80%) and final test set (20%). All related clinical and laboratory 
      variables were extracted, and logistics stepwise regression was performed to 
      screen out the key features. Six different advanced machine-learning models, 
      including logistics regression (LOG), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors 
      (KNN), support-vector machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and 
      Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), were introduced for modelling. The 
      best performance model in the first cross-validated dataset was further 
      fine-tuned, and the final performance was assessed using the final test set. 
      RESULTS: A total of 14,777 patients were included in the study, and 1,864 of the 
      patients' experienced hypoxemia after extubation. After training, the RF and 
      LightGBM models were the strongest initial performers, and the area under the 
      curve (AUC) using RF was 0.780 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.755-0.805] and 
      using LightGBM was 0.779 (95% CI, 0.752-0.806). The final AUC using RF was 0.792 
      (95% CI, 0.771-0.814) and using LightGBM was 0.792 (95% CI, 0.770-0.815). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning models have considerable potential for 
      predicting hypoxemia after extubation, which help to reduce ICU morbidity and 
      mortality.

AB  - Pain research traverses many disciplines and methodologies. Yet, despite our 
      understanding and field-wide acceptance of the multifactorial essence of pain as 
      a sensory perception, emotional experience, and biopsychosocial condition, pain 
      scientists and practitioners often remain siloed within their domain expertise 
      and associated techniques. The context in which the field finds itself today-with 
      increasing reliance on digital technologies, an on-going pandemic, and continued 
      disparities in pain care-requires new collaborations and different approaches to 
      measuring pain. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in human pain research, 
      summarizing emerging practices and cutting-edge techniques across multiple 
      methods and technologies. For each, we outline foreseeable technosocial 
      considerations, reflecting on implications for standards of care, pain 
      management, research, and societal impact. Through overviewing alternative data 
      sources and varied ways of measuring pain and by reflecting on the concerns, 
      limitations, and challenges facing the field, we hope to create critical 
      dialogues, inspire more collaborations, and foster new ideas for future pain 
      research methods.

      Guinea Pigs.
PG  - 925042

LID - 925042
AB  - Electrocardiograms (ECG) are universally used to measure the electrical activity 
      of the heart; however, variations in recording techniques and/or subject 
      demographics can affect ECG interpretation. In this study, we investigated 
      variables that are likely to influence ECG metric measurements in cardiovascular 
      research, including recording technique, use of anesthesia, and animal model 
      characteristics. Awake limb lead ECG recordings were collected in vivo from adult 
      guinea pigs using a platform ECG system, while recordings in anesthetized animals 
      were performed using both a platform and needle ECG system. We report significant 
      heterogeneities in ECG metric values that are attributed to methodological 
      differences (e.g., ECG lead configuration, ECG recording platform, presence or 
      absence of anesthesia) that persist even within the same cohort of animals. 
      Further, we report that variability in animal demographics is preserved in vivo 
      ECG recordings-with animal age serving as a significant contributor, while 
      sex-specific influences were less pronounced. Methodological approaches and 
      subject demographics should be fully considered when interpreting ECG values in 
      animal models, comparing datasets between studies, or developing artificial 
      intelligence algorithms that utilize an ECG database.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) is an increasingly popular method of data analysis that has 
      meaningful application within the realm of pain management. Current research has 
      used this technique as a tool to refine patient selection for more invasive pain 
      management treatments in an effort to improve outcomes. It is also being used to 
      aid in the search for biomarkers that could objectify the quantification of pain 
      to better assess these outcomes. This article provides an overview of ML and its 
      applications within the pain field.

AB  - Development and validation of pain biomarkers has become a major issue in pain 
      research. Recent advances in multimodal data acquisition have allowed researchers 
      to gather multivariate and multilevel whole-body measurements in patients with 
      pain conditions, and data analysis techniques such as machine learning have led 
      to novel findings in neural biomarkers for pain. Most studies have focused on the 
      development of a biomarker to predict the severity of pain with high precision 
      and high specificity, however, a similar approach to discriminate different 
      modalities of pain is lacking. Identification of more accurate and specific pain 
      biomarkers will require an in-depth understanding of the modality specificity of 
      pain. In this review, we summarize early and recent findings on the modality 
      specificity of pain in the brain, with a focus on distinct neural activity 
      patterns between chronic clinical and acute experimental pain, direct, social, 
      and vicarious pain, and somatic and visceral pain. We also suggest future 
      directions to improve our current strategy of pain management using our knowledge 
      of modality-specific aspects of pain.

AB  - The analysis of the public interest as reflected by Internet queries has become a 
      highly valuable tool in many fields. The Google Trends platform, providing timely 
      and informative data, has become increasingly popular in health and medical 
      studies. This study explores whether Internet search frequencies for the keyword 
      "headache" have been increasing after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, which could 
      signal an increased incidence of the health problem. Weekly search volume data 
      for 5 years spanning February 2017 to February 2022 were sourced from Google 
      Trends. Six statistical and machine-learning methods were implemented on training 
      and testing sets via pre-set automated forecasting algorithms. Holt-Winters has 
      been identified as overperforming in predicting web query trends through several 
      accuracy measures and the DM test for forecasting superiority and has been 
      employed for producing the baseline level in the estimation of excess query level 
      over the first pandemic wave. Findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic 
      resulted in an increased global incidence of headache (as proxied by related web 
      queries) in the first 6 months after its outbreak, with an excess occurrence of 
      4.53% globally. However, the study also concludes that the increasing trend in 
      headache incidence at the world level would have continued in the absence of the 
      pandemic, but it has been accelerated by the pandemic event. Results further show 
      mixed correlations at the country-level between COVID-19 infection rates and 
      population web-search behavior, suggesting that the increased headache incidence 
      is caused by pandemic-related factors (i.e. increased stress and mental health 
      problems), rather than a direct effect of coronavirus infections. Other 
      noteworthy findings entail that in the Philippines, the term "headache" was the 
      most frequently searched term in the period spanning February 2020 to February 
      2022, indicating that headache occurrences are a significant aspect that defines 
      population health at the country level. High relative interest is also detected 
      in Kenya and South Africa after the pandemic outbreak. Additionally, research 
      findings indicate that the relative interest has decreased in some countries 
      (i.e. US, Canada, and Australia), whereas it has increased in others (i.e. India 
      and Pakistan) after the pandemic outbreak. We conclude that observing Internet 
      search habits can provide timely information for policymakers on collective 
      health trends, as opposed to ex-post statistics, and can furthermore yield 
      valuable information for the pain management drug market key players about 
      aggregate consumer behavior.

AB  - Nanotechnology with artificial intelligence (AI) can metamorphose medicine to an 
      extent that has never been achieved before. AI could be used in anesthesia to 
      develop advanced clinical decision support tools based on machine learning, 
      increasing efficiency, and accuracy. It is also potentially highly troublesome by 
      creating insecurity among clinicians and allowing the transfer of expert domain 
      knowledge to machines. Anesthesia is a complex medical specialty, and assuming AI 
      can easily replace the expert as a clinically sound anesthetist is a very 
      unrealistic expectation. This paper focuses on the association and opportunities 
      for AI developments and deep learning with anesthesia. It reviews the current 
      advances in AI tools and hardware technologies and outlines how these can be used 
      in the field of anesthesia.

AB  - Untreated pain after surgery leads to poor patient satisfaction, longer hospital 
      length of stay, lower health-related quality of life, and non-compliance with 
      rehabilitation regimens. The aim of this study is to characterize the structure 
      of acute pain trajectories during the postsurgical hospitalization period and 
      quantify their association with pain at 30-days and 1-year after surgery. This 
      cohort study included 2106 adult (≥18 years) surgical patients who consented to 
      participate in the SATISFY-SOS registry (February 1, 2015 to September 30, 2017). 
      Patients were excluded if they did not undergo invasive surgeries, were 
      classified as outpatients, failed to complete follow up assessments at 30-days 
      and 1-year following surgery, had greater than 4-days of inpatient stay, and/or 
      recorded fewer than four pain scores during their acute hospitalization period. 
      The primary exposure was the acute postsurgical pain trajectories identified by a 
      machine learning-based latent class approach using patient-reported pain scores. 
      Clinically meaningful pain (≥3 on a 0-10 scale) at 30-days and 1-year after 
      surgery were the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Of the study 
      participants (N = 2106), 59% were female, 91% were non-Hispanic White, and the 
      mean (SD) age was 62 (13) years; 41% of patients underwent orthopedic surgery and 
      88% received general anesthesia. Four acute pain trajectory clusters were 
      identified. Pain trajectories were significantly associated with clinically 
      meaningful pain at 30-days (p = 0.007), but not at 1-year (p = 0.79) after 
      surgery using covariate-adjusted logistic regression models. Compared to Cluster 
      1, the other clusters had lower statistically significant odds of having pain at 
      30-days after surgery (Cluster 2: [OR = 0.67, 95%CI (0.51-0.89)]; Cluster 3:[OR = 
      0.74, 95%CI (0.56-0.99)]; Cluster 4:[OR = 0.46, 95%CI (0.26-0.82)], all p<0.05). 
      Patients in Cluster 1 had the highest cumulative likelihood of pain and pain 
      intensity during the latter half of their acute hospitalization period (48-96 
      hours), potentially contributing to the higher odds of pain during the 30-day 
      postsurgical period. Early identification and management of high-risk pain 
      trajectories can help in ascertaining appropriate pain management interventions. 
      Such interventions can mitigate the occurrence of long-term disabilities 
      associated with pain.

PG  - 155-163

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) models have been developed to predict perioperative 
      clinical parameters. The objective of this study was to determine if ML models 
      can serve as decision aids to improve anesthesiologists' prediction of peak 
      intraoperative glucose values and postoperative opioid requirements. A web-based 
      tool was used to present actual surgical case and patient information to 10 
      practicing anesthesiologists. They were asked to predict peak glucose levels and 
      post-operative opioid requirements for 100 surgical patients with and without 
      presenting ML model estimations of peak glucose and opioid requirements. The 
      accuracies of the anesthesiologists' estimates with and without ML estimates as 
      reference were compared. A questionnaire was also sent to the participating 
      anesthesiologists to obtain their feedback on ML decision support. The accuracy 
      of peak glucose level estimates by the anesthesiologists increased from 
      79.0 ± 13.7% without ML assistance to 84.7 ± 11.5% (< 0.001) when ML estimates 
      were provided as reference. The accuracy of opioid requirement estimates 
      increased from 18% without ML assistance to 42% (p < 0.001) when ML estimates 
      were provided as reference. When ML estimates were provided, predictions of peak 
      glucose improved for 8 out of the 10 anesthesiologists, while predictions of 
      opioid requirements improved for 7 of the 10 anesthesiologists. Feedback 
      questionnaire responses revealed that the anesthesiologist primarily used the ML 
      estimates as reference to modify their clinical judgement. ML models can improve 
      anesthesiologists' estimation of clinical parameters. ML predictions primarily 
      served as reference information that modified an anesthesiologist's clinical 
      estimate.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the application of ultrasound-guided 
      low-dose dexmedetomidine combined with lumbosacral plexus block based on 
      artificial intelligence algorithm in the surgical treatment of proximal femoral 
      fractures. 104 patients with proximal femoral fractures were divided into 52 
      cases in the experimental group (ultrasound-guided lumbosacral plexus block 
      combined with dexmedetomidine based on local fitting image segmentation 
      algorithm) and 52 cases in the routine group (endotracheal intubation and 
      inhalation combined with general anesthesia). An image segmentation algorithm 
      based on local fitting was constructed to enhance the ultrasound image. It was 
      found that in the routine group, the heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure 
      (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at the beginning of intravenous 
      injection of dexmedetomidine, during skin incision, and half an hour after skin 
      incision were significantly lower than those at admission (P < 0.05). The 
      pressing times of patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) in the 
      conventional group (17.05 ± 6.85 times) were significantly higher than that in 
      the experimental group (8.55 ± 4.12 times), and the difference was statistically 
      significant (P < 0.05). The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at 1, 5, 10, and 
      15 after operation in the routine group were significantly higher than those in 
      the experimental group (P < 0.05). The number of dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, 
      venous thrombosis of lower limbs, cardiovascular events, and pulmonary infection 
      in the routine group on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd days after operation were 
      significantly higher than those in the experimental group (P < 0.05). In summary, 
      the ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus-sacral plexus block combined with 
      dexmedetomidine anesthesia based on image segmentation algorithm can effectively 
      maintain the hemodynamic stability of patients, with remarkable analgesic effect 
      and high safety.

AB  - In modern anesthesia, multiple medical devices are used simultaneously to 
      comprehensively monitor real-time vital signs to optimize patient care and 
      improve surgical outcomes. However, interpreting the dynamic changes of 
      time-series biosignals and their correlations is a difficult task even for 
      experienced anesthesiologists. Recent advanced machine learning technologies have 
      shown promising results in biosignal analysis, however, research and development 
      in this area is relatively slow due to the lack of biosignal datasets for machine 
      learning. The VitalDB (Vital Signs DataBase) is an open dataset created 
      specifically to facilitate machine learning studies related to monitoring vital 
      signs in surgical patients. This dataset contains high-resolution multi-parameter 
      data from 6,388 cases, including 486,451 waveform and numeric data tracks of 196 
      intraoperative monitoring parameters, 73 perioperative clinical parameters, and 
      34 time-series laboratory result parameters. All data is stored in the public 
      cloud after anonymization. The dataset can be freely accessed and analysed using 
      application programming interfaces and Python library. The VitalDB public dataset 
      is expected to be a valuable resource for biosignal research and development.

TI  - Prediction of blood pressure changes associated with abdominal pressure changes 
      during robotic laparoscopic low abdominal surgery using deep learning.
PG  - e0269468

LID - e0269468
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraoperative hypertension and blood pressure (BP) fluctuation are 
      known to be associated with negative patient outcomes. During robotic lower 
      abdominal surgery, the patient's abdominal cavity is filled with CO2, and the 
      patient's head is steeply positioned toward the floor (Trendelenburg position). 
      Pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position together with physiological 
      alterations during anesthesia, interfere with predicting BP changes. Recently, 
      deep learning using recurrent neural networks (RNN) was shown to be effective in 
      predicting intraoperative BP. A model for predicting BP rise was designed using 
      RNN under special scenarios during robotic laparoscopic surgery and its accuracy 
      was tested. METHODS: Databases that included adult patients (over 19 years old) 
      undergoing low abdominal da Vinci robotic surgery (ovarian cystectomy, 
      hysterectomy, myomectomy, prostatectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy) at 
      Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital from October 2018 to March 2021 were 
      used. An RNN-based model was designed using Python3 language with the PyTorch 
      packages. The model was trained to predict whether hypertension (20% increase in 
      the mean BP from baseline) would develop within 10 minutes after 
      pneumoperitoneum. RESULTS: Eight distinct datasets were generated and the 
      predictive power was compared. The macro-average F1 scores of the datasets ranged 
      from 68.18% to 72.33%. It took only 3.472 milliseconds to obtain 39 prediction 
      outputs. CONCLUSIONS: A prediction model using the RNN may predict BP rises 
      during robotic laparoscopic surgery.

TI  - Multiscale depth of anaesthesia prediction for surgery using frontal cortex 
      electroencephalography.
PG  - 43-53
LID - 10.1049/htl2.12025 [doi]
AB  - Hypnotic and sedative anaesthetic agents are employed during multiple medical 
      interventions to prevent patient awareness. Careful titration of agent dosing is 
      required to avoid negative side effects; the accuracy thereof may be improved by 
      Depth of Anaesthesia Monitoring. This work investigates the potential of a 
      patient specific depth monitoring prediction using electroencephalography 
      recorded neural oscillation from the frontal lobe of 10 patients during sedation, 
      where a comparison of the prediction accuracy was made across five different 
      approaches to post-processing; Noise Assisted-Empirical Mode Decomposition, the 
      Raw Signal, Linear Series Decomposition Learner, Deep Wavelet Scattering and Deep 
      Learning features. These methods towards anaesthesia depth prediction were 
      investigated using the Bispectral Index as ground truth, where it was seen that 
      the Raw Signal, enhanced feature set and a low complexity classification model 
      (Linear Discriminant Analysis) provided the best classification accuracy, in the 
      region of 85.65 % ±10.23 % across the 10 subjects. Subsequent work in this area 
      would now build on these results and validate the best performing methods on a 
      wider cohort of patients, investigate means of continuous DoA estimation using 
      regressions, and also feature optimisation exercises in order to further 
      streamline and reduce the computation complexity of the designed model.

      technology.
PG  - 360-366
LID - 10.1097/MCC.0000000000000940 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Two years of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic 
      highlighted that excessive sedation in the ICU leading to coma and other adverse 
      outcomes remains pervasive. There is a need to improve monitoring and management 
      of sedation in mechanically ventilated patients. Remote technologies that are 
      based on automated analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) could enhance standard 
      care and alert clinicians real-time when severe EEG suppression or other abnormal 
      brain states are detected. RECENT FINDINGS: High rates of drug-induced coma as 
      well as delirium were found in several large cohorts of mechanically ventilated 
      patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In patients with acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome, high doses of sedatives comparable to general anesthesia have been 
      commonly administered without defined EEG endpoints. Continuous limited-channel 
      EEG can reveal pathologic brain states such as burst suppression, that cannot be 
      diagnosed by neurological examination alone. Recent studies documented that 
      machine learning-based analysis of continuous EEG signal is feasible and that 
      this approach can identify burst suppression as well as delirium with high 
      specificity. SUMMARY: Preventing oversedation in the ICU remains a challenge. 
      Continuous monitoring of EEG activity, automated EEG analysis, and generation of 
      alerts to clinicians may reduce drug-induced coma and potentially improve patient 
      outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative sleep disorder is common and may cause aggravated 
      postoperative pain, delirium, and poor prognosis. We accessed the effect of 
      intraoperative intravenous dexmedetomidine on postoperative sleep quality in 
      patients with endoscopic sinus surgery.  METHODS: This single-center, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial enrolled a total of 
      110 participants aged 18 years to 65 years who were scheduled to receive 
      endoscopic sinus surgery. Placebo (normal saline) or dexmedetomidine infusion 
      (load dose 0.5 μg kg(-1) over 10 min, followed by maintenance dose 0.2 ug 
      kg(-1) h(-1)) during surgery. The primary outcome was postoperative sleep 
      quality. Secondary outcomes were postoperative Ramsay sedation scores, Visual 
      Analog Scale (VAS) scores, serum cortisol, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 
      hypocretin, delirium, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). RESULTS: 
      Among enrolled 110 patients, 55 were randomized to administer intraoperative 
      dexmedetomidine and placebo. In total, 14 patients (7 in each group) were 
      excluded because of protocol deviations, and 96 patients (48 in each group) were 
      included in the per-protocol analysis. The dexmedetomidine group had a 
      significantly higher sleep efficiency index(SEI) (66.85[3.00] vs 65.38[3.58]), 
      the ratio of rapid eye movement sleep to total sleep(REM)(13.63[1.45] vs 
      12.38[2.11]) and lower arousal index (AI) (7.20[1.00] vs 8.07[1.29]), higher 
      Ramsay sedation score at post-operation 1 h, 12 h point, lower VAS scores at 
      post-operation 1 h, 12 h, 24 h point, lower cortisol, higher 5-HT and hypocretin 
      in serum than the placebo group. CONCLUSION: In this randomized clinical trial, 
      dexmedetomidine can improve the sleep quality of patients undergoing endoscopic 
      sinus surgery. These results suggest that this therapy may be a viable strategy 
      to enhance postoperative sleep quality in patients with endoscopic sinus surgery. 
      TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the Bethune International Peace 
      Hospital Ethics Committee (2021-KY-129) and registered in the Chinese Clinical 
      Trial Registry ( ChiCTR2100051598 , 28/09/2021).

AB  - Epidural anesthesia requires injection of anesthetic into the epidural space in 
      the spine. Accurate placement of the epidural needle is a major challenge. To 
      address this, we developed a forward-view endoscopic optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT) system for real-time imaging of the tissue in front of the needle tip 
      during the puncture. We tested this OCT system in porcine backbones and developed 
      a set of deep learning models to automatically process the imaging data for 
      needle localization. A series of binary classification models were developed to 
      recognize the five layers of the backbone, including fat, interspinous ligament, 
      ligamentum flavum, epidural space, and spinal cord. The classification models 
      provided an average classification accuracy of 96.65%. During puncture, it is 
      important to maintain a safe distance between the needle tip and the dura mater. 
      Regression models were developed to estimate that distance based on the OCT 
      imaging data. Based on the Inception architecture, our models achieved a mean 
      absolute percentage error of 3.05% ± 0.55%. Overall, our results validated the 
      technical feasibility of using this novel imaging strategy to automatically 
      recognize different tissue structures and measure the distances ahead of the 
      needle tip during the epidural needle placement.

AB  - The physiological and neuroregulatory mechanism of propofol is largely based on 
      very limited knowledge. It is one of the important puzzling issues in 
      anesthesiology and is of great value in both scientific and clinical fields. It 
      is acknowledged that neural networks which are comprised of a number of neural 
      circuits might be involved in the anesthetic mechanism. However, the mechanism of 
      this hypothesis needs to be further elucidated. With the progress of artificial 
      intelligence, it is more likely to solve this problem through using artificial 
      neural networks to perform temporal waveform data analysis and to construct 
      biophysical computational models. This review focuses on current knowledge 
      regarding the anesthetic mechanism of propofol, an intravenous general 
      anesthetic, by constructing biophysical computational models.

TI  - Classifying Characteristics of Opioid Use Disorder From Hospital Discharge 
      Summaries Using Natural Language Processing.
PG  - 850619

LID - 850619
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is underdiagnosed in health system 
      settings, limiting research on OUD using electronic health records (EHRs). 
      Medical encounter notes can enrich structured EHR data with documented signs and 
      symptoms of OUD and social risks and behaviors. To capture this information at 
      scale, natural language processing (NLP) tools must be developed and evaluated. 
      We developed and applied an annotation schema to deeply characterize OUD and 
      related clinical, behavioral, and environmental factors, and automated the 
      annotation schema using machine learning and deep learning-based approaches. 
      METHODS: Using the MIMIC-III Critical Care Database, we queried hospital 
      discharge summaries of patients with International Classification of Diseases 
      (ICD-9) OUD diagnostic codes. We developed an annotation schema to characterize 
      problematic opioid use, identify individuals with potential OUD, and provide 
      psychosocial context. Two annotators reviewed discharge summaries from 100 
      patients. We randomly sampled patients with their associated annotated sentences 
      and divided them into training (66 patients; 2,127 annotated sentences) and 
      testing (29 patients; 1,149 annotated sentences) sets. We used the training set 
      to generate features, employing three NLP algorithms/knowledge sources. We 
      trained and tested prediction models for classification with a traditional 
      machine learner (logistic regression) and deep learning approach (Autogluon based 
      on ELECTRA's replaced token detection model). We applied a five-fold 
      cross-validation approach to reduce bias in performance estimates. RESULTS: The 
      resulting annotation schema contained 32 classes. We achieved moderate 
      inter-annotator agreement, with F(1)-scores across all classes increasing from 48 
      to 66%. Five classes had a sufficient number of annotations for automation; of 
      these, we observed consistently high performance (F(1)-scores) across training 
      and testing sets for drug screening (training: 91-96; testing: 91-94) and opioid 
      type (training: 86-96; testing: 86-99). Performance dropped from training and to 
      testing sets for other drug use (training: 52-65; testing: 40-48), pain 
      management (training: 72-78; testing: 61-78) and psychiatric (training: 73-80; 
      testing: 72). Autogluon achieved the highest performance. CONCLUSION: This pilot 
      study demonstrated that rich information regarding problematic opioid use can be 
      manually identified by annotators. However, more training samples and features 
      would improve our ability to reliably identify less common classes from clinical 
      text, including text from outpatient settings.

AB  - In order to effectively improve the application of analgesic pump devices in the 
      treatment of children, a method based on remote control artificial intelligence 
      is proposed. 100 children with dental pulpitis who were treated in a hospital 
      from December 2018 to December 2020 were selected as the research subjects; they 
      were randomly divided into control group and observation group by an equidistant 
      sampling method, with 50 cases in each group. Children in the control group were 
      given articaine and adrenaline anesthesia, and the observation group was treated 
      with articaine and adrenaline combined with a computer-controlled anesthesia 
      system, the anesthesia pain degree and satisfaction degree of the two groups of 
      children were observed and compared. The results showed that the pain score in 
      anesthesia and intraoperative pain score in the observation group was 
      significantly lower than that in the control group, and the differences were 
      statistically significant (P < 0.05). The total satisfaction of 96.6% patients in 
      the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group 
      (84.7%) and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There were 
      no serious complications in both groups. The application of the computer

AB  - In 2021, progress in clinical science related to Cardiac Anesthesiology 
      continued, but at a slower rate due to the ongoing pandemic and disruptions to 
      clinical research. Most progress was incremental and addressed persistent 
      questions related to our field. To identify articles for this review, we 
      completed a structured review using our previously reported methods (1). 
      Specifically, we used the search terms: "cardiac anesthesiology and outcomes" (n 
      = 177), "cardiothoracic anesthesiology" (n = 34), "cardiac anesthesia," and 
      "clinical outcomes" (n = 42) filtered on clinical trials and the year 2021 in 
      PubMed. We also reviewed clinical trials from the most prominent clinical 
      journals to identify additional studies for a narrative review. We then selected 
      the most noteworthy publications for inclusion in this review and identified key 
      themes.

TI  - Identifying modifiable and nonmodifiable cost drivers of ambulatory rotator cuff 
      repair: a machine learning analysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Implementing novel tools that identify contributors to the cost of 
      orthopedic procedures can help hospitals maximize efficiency, minimize waste, 
      improve surgical decision-making, and practice value-based care. The purpose of 
      this study was to develop and internally validate a machine learning algorithm to 
      identify key drivers of total charges after ambulatory arthroscopic rotator cuff 
      repair and compare its performance with a state-of-the-art statistical learning 
      model. METHODS: A retrospective review of the New York State Ambulatory Surgery 
      and Services Database was performed to identify patients who underwent elective 
      outpatient rotator cuff repair (RCR) from 2015 to 2016. Initial models were 
      constructed using patient characteristics (age, gender, insurance status, patient 
      income, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index) as well as intraoperative variables 
      (concomitant procedures and services, operative time). These were subsequently 
      entered into 5 separate machine learning algorithms and a generalized additive 
      model using natural splines. Global variable importance and partial dependence 
      curves were constructed to identify the greatest contributors to cost. RESULTS: A 
      total of 33,976 patients undergoing ambulatory RCR were included. Median total 
      charges after ambulatory RCR were $16,017 (interquartile range: $11,009-$22,510). 
      The ensemble model outperformed the generalized additive model and demonstrated 
      the best performance on internal validation (root mean squared error: $7112, 95% 
      confidence interval: 7036-7188; logarithmic root mean squared error: 0.354, 95% 
      confidence interval: 0.336-0.373, R(2): 0.53), and identified major drivers of 
      total charges after RCR as increasing operating room time, patient income level, 
      number of anchors used, use of local infiltration anesthesia/peripheral nerve 
      blocks, non-White race/ethnicity, and concurrent distal clavicle excision. The 
      model was integrated into a web-based open-access application capable of 
      providing individual predictions and explanations on a case-by-case basis. 
      CONCLUSION: This study developed an ensemble supervised machine learning 
      algorithm that outperformed a sophisticated statistical learning model in 
      predicting total charges after ambulatory RCR. Important contributors to total 
      charges included operating room time, duration of care, number of anchors used, 
      type of anesthesia, concomitant distal clavicle excision, community 
      characteristics, and patient demographic factors. Generation of a 
      patient-specific payment schedule based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
      Quality risk of mortality highlighted the financial risk assumed by physicians in 
      flat episodic reimbursement schedules given variable patient comorbidities and 
      the importance of an accurate prediction algorithm to appropriately reward 
      high-value care at low costs.

TI  - Improvement of Pain Management by Nefopam in a Rat Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis 
      Model.
PG  - 809980
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.809980 [doi]
LID - 809980
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model is widely used in 
      research to investigate arthritis pathogenesis. Hind paw inflammation is the main 
      outcome in this model with high loss of mobility function partly related to pain. 
      However, analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioid drugs 
      interfere with the inflammation process related to arthritis, thus reducing their 
      beneficial use in this model. Therefore, we investigated the effect of nefopam on 
      arthritis development in order to improve pain management in the AIA model. 
      METHODS: Female Lewis rats were randomly divided into two groups, and each group 
      received an injection of Mycobacterium butyricum on defining day (D) 0. At D6, 
      rats (n = 10) received nefopam (intraperitoneally or orally) or NaCl 0.9% IP or 
      1% sucrose in water (n = 5 for each). Rats were monitored with the arthritic 
      index (AI) and ankle circumference. Pain was assessed by scoring based on 
      behavioral indicators. Histology, RT-qPCR, and microcomputed tomography were 
      performed. RESULTS: The clinical parameter AI and ankle circumference were not 
      different in both groups at various time points. However, pain score was 
      significantly lower in the nefopam group at the early stage of the disease. At a 
      later stage of the disease, inflammation was mildly lower whereas bone erosion 
      and bone loss parameters increased in the nefopam group. CONCLUSION: Nefopam 
      provided a slight reduction in the level of pain at the arthritis onset without 
      reducing arthritis severity and bone loss in the rat AIA model. However, it 
      should be administrated orally for a shorter period to avoid inflammation 
      reduction in the long run.

TI  - Patient-Reported Outcomes for Function and Pain in Total Knee Arthroplasty 
      Patients.
PG  - E39-E47
LID - 10.1097/NNR.0000000000000602 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty successfully manage 
      their condition postoperatively, whereas others encounter challenges in regaining 
      function and controlling pain during recovery at home. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      study was to use traditional statistics and machine learning to develop 
      prediction models that identify patients likely to have increased care needs 
      related to managing function and pain following total knee arthroplasty. METHODS: 
      This study included 201 patients. Outcomes were changes between baseline and 
      follow-up in the functional and pain subcomponents of the Oxford Knee Score. Both 
      classification and regression modeling were applied. Twenty-one predictors were 
      included. Tenfold cross-validation was used, and the regression models were 
      evaluated based on root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, and coefficient 
      of determination. Classification models were evaluated based on the area under 
      the receiver operating curve, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: In 
      classification modeling, random forest and stochastic gradient boosting provided 
      the best overall metrics for model performance. A support vector machine and a 
      stochastic gradient boosting machine in regression modeling provided the best 
      predictive performance. The models performed better in predicting challenges 
      related to function compared to challenges related to pain. DISCUSSION: There is 
      valuable predictive information in the data routinely collected for patients 
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty. The developed models may predict patients who 
      are likely to have enhanced care needs regarding function and pain management. 
      Improvements are needed before the models can be implemented in routine clinical 
      practice.

AB  - The advent of increasingly sophisticated medical technology, surgical 
      interventions, and supportive healthcare measures is raising survival 
      probabilities for babies born premature and/or with life-threatening health 
      conditions. In the United States, this trend is associated with greater numbers 
      of neonatal surgeries and higher admission rates into neonatal intensive care 
      units (NICU) for newborns at all birth weights. Following surgery, current pain 
      management in NICU relies primarily on narcotics (opioids) such as morphine and 
      fentanyl (about 100 times more potent than morphine) that lead to a number of 
      complications, including prolonged stays in NICU for opioid withdrawal. In this 
      paper, we review current practices and challenges for pain assessment and 
      treatment in NICU and outline ongoing efforts using Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
      to support pain- and opioid-sparing approaches for newborns in the future. A 
      major focus for these next-generation approaches to NICU-based pain management is 
      proactive pain mitigation (avoidance) aimed at preventing harm to neonates from 
      both postsurgical pain and opioid withdrawal. AI-based frameworks can use single 
      or multiple combinations of continuous objective variables, that is, facial and 
      body movements, crying frequencies, and physiological data (vital signs), to make 
      high-confidence predictions about time-to-pain onset following postsurgical 
      sedation. Such predictions would create a therapeutic window prior to pain onset 
      for mitigation with non-narcotic pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical 
      interventions. These emerging AI-based strategies have the potential to minimize 
      or avoid damage to the neonate's body and psyche from postsurgical pain and 
      opioid withdrawal.

AB  - The lack of sensitive and robust behavioral assessments of pain in preclinical 
      models has been a major limitation for both pain research and the development of 
      novel analgesics. Here, we demonstrate a novel data acquisition and analysis 
      platform that provides automated, quantitative, and objective measures of 
      naturalistic rodent behavior in an observer-independent and unbiased fashion. The 
      technology records freely behaving mice, in the dark, over extended periods for 
      continuous acquisition of 2 parallel video data streams: (1) near-infrared 
      frustrated total internal reflection for detecting the degree, force, and timing 
      of surface contact and (2) simultaneous ongoing video graphing of whole-body 
      pose. Using machine vision and machine learning, we automatically extract and 
      quantify behavioral features from these data to reveal moment-by-moment changes 
      that capture the internal pain state of rodents in multiple pain models. We show 
      that these voluntary pain-related behaviors are reversible by analgesics and that 
      analgesia can be automatically and objectively differentiated from sedation. 
      Finally, we used this approach to generate a paw luminance ratio measure that is 
      sensitive in capturing dynamic mechanical hypersensitivity over a period and 
      scalable for high-throughput preclinical analgesic efficacy assessment.

TI  - Predicting Postoperative Mortality With Deep Neural Networks and Natural Language 
      Processing: Model Development and Validation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) achieves better predictions of postoperative 
      mortality than previous prediction tools. Free-text descriptions of the 
      preoperative diagnosis and the planned procedure are available preoperatively. 
      Because reading these descriptions helps anesthesiologists evaluate the risk of 
      the surgery, we hypothesized that deep learning (DL) models with unstructured 
      text could improve postoperative mortality prediction. However, it is challenging 
      to extract meaningful concept embeddings from this unstructured clinical text. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a fusion DL model containing structured and 
      unstructured features to predict the in-hospital 30-day postoperative mortality 
      before surgery. ML models for predicting postoperative mortality using 
      preoperative data with or without free clinical text were assessed. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively collected preoperative anesthesia assessments, surgical 
      information, and discharge summaries of patients undergoing general and neuraxial 
      anesthesia from electronic health records (EHRs) from 2016 to 2020. We first 
      compared the deep neural network (DNN) with other models using the same input 
      features to demonstrate effectiveness. Then, we combined the DNN model with 
      bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to extract 
      information from clinical texts. The effects of adding text information on the 
      model performance were compared using the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve 
      (AUPRC). Statistical significance was evaluated using P<.05. RESULTS: The final 
      cohort contained 121,313 patients who underwent surgeries. A total of 1562 
      (1.29%) patients died within 30 days of surgery. Our BERT-DNN model achieved the 
      highest AUROC (0.964, 95% CI 0.961-0.967) and AUPRC (0.336, 95% CI 0.276-0.402). 
      The AUROC of the BERT-DNN was significantly higher compared to logistic 
      regression (AUROC=0.952, 95% CI 0.949-0.955) and the American Society of 
      Anesthesiologist Physical Status (ASAPS AUROC=0.892, 95% CI 0.887-0.896) but not 
      significantly higher compared to the DNN (AUROC=0.959, 95% CI 0.956-0.962) and 
      the random forest (AUROC=0.961, 95% CI 0.958-0.964). The AUPRC of the BERT-DNN 
      was significantly higher compared to the DNN (AUPRC=0.319, 95% CI 0.260-0.384), 
      the random forest (AUPRC=0.296, 95% CI 0.239-0.360), logistic regression 
      (AUPRC=0.276, 95% CI 0.220-0.339), and the ASAPS (AUPRC=0.149, 95% CI 
      0.107-0.203). CONCLUSIONS: Our BERT-DNN model has an AUPRC significantly higher 
      compared to previously proposed models using no text and an AUROC significantly 
      higher compared to logistic regression and the ASAPS. This technique helps 
      identify patients with higher risk from the surgical description text in EHRs.

AB  - Dissipative systems evolve in the preferred temporal direction indicated by the 
      thermodynamic arrow of time. The fundamental nature of this temporal asymmetry 
      led us to hypothesize its presence in the neural activity evoked by conscious 
      perception of the physical world, and thus its covariance with the level of 
      conscious awareness. We implemented a data-driven deep learning framework to 
      decode the temporal inversion of electrocorticography signals acquired from 
      non-human primates. Brain activity time series recorded during conscious 
      wakefulness could be distinguished from their inverted counterparts with high 
      accuracy, both using frequency and phase information. However, classification 
      accuracy was reduced for data acquired during deep sleep and under 
      ketamine-induced anesthesia; moreover, the predictions obtained from multiple 
      independent neural networks were less consistent for sleep and anesthesia than 
      for conscious wakefulness. Finally, the analysis of feature importance scores 
      highlighted transitions between slow ($\approx$20 Hz) and fast frequencies 
      (>40 Hz) as the main contributors to the temporal asymmetry observed during 
      conscious wakefulness. Our results show that a preferred temporal direction is 
      manifest in the neural activity evoked by conscious mentation and in the 
      phenomenology of the passage of time, establishing common ground to tackle the 
      relationship between brain and subjective experience.

TI  - Prediction and Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithm for Prediction of Blood 
      Transfusion during Cesarean Section and Analysis of Risk Factors of Hypothermia 
      during Anesthesia Recovery.
PG  - 8661324
LID - 10.1155/2022/8661324 [doi]
LID - 8661324
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the application of machine learning algorithm in the 
      prediction and evaluation of cesarean section, predicting the amount of blood 
      transfusion during cesarean section and to analyze the risk factors of 
      hypothermia during anesthesia recovery. METHODS: (1)Through the hospital 
      electronic medical record of medical system, a total of 600 parturients who 
      underwent cesarean section in our hospital from June 2019 to December 2020 were 
      included. The maternal age, admission time, diagnosis, and other case data were 
      recorded. The routine method of cesarean section was intraspinal anesthesia, and 
      general anesthesia was only used for patients' strong demand, taboo, or failure 
      of intraspinal anesthesia. According to the standard of intraoperative bleeding, 
      the patients were divided into two groups: the obvious bleeding group (MH group, 
      N = 154) and nonobvious hemorrhage group (NMH group, N = 446). The preoperative, 
      intraoperative, and postoperative indexes of parturients in the two groups were 
      analyzed and compared. Then, the risk factors of intraoperative bleeding were 
      screened by logistic regression analysis with the occurrence of obvious bleeding 
      as the dependent variable and the factors in the univariate analysis as 
      independent variables. In order to further predict intraoperative blood 
      transfusion, the standard cases of recesarean section and variables with possible 
      clinical significance were included in the prediction model. Logistic regression, 
      XGB, and ANN3 machine learning algorithms were used to construct the prediction 
      model of intraoperative blood transfusion. The area under ROC curve (AUROC), 
      accuracy, recall rate, and F1 value were calculated and compared. (2) According 
      to whether hypothermia occurred in the anesthesia recovery room, the patients 
      were divided into two groups: the hypothermia group (N = 244) and nonhypothermia 
      group (N = 356). The incidence of hypothermia was calculated, and the relevant 
      clinical data were collected. On the basis of consulting the literatures, the 
      factors probably related to hypothermia were collected and analyzed by univariate 
      statistical analysis, and the statistically significant factors were analyzed by 
      multifactor logistic regression analysis to screen the independent risk factors 
      of hypothermia in anesthetic convalescent patients. RESULTS: (1) First of all, we 
      compared the basic data of the blood transfusion group and the nontransfusion 
      group. The gestational age of the transfusion group was lower than that of the 
      nontransfusion group, and the times of cesarean section and pregnancy in the 
      transfusion group were higher than those of the non-transfusion group. Secondly, 
      we compared the incidence of complications between the blood transfusion group 
      and the nontransfusion group. The incidence of pregnancy complications was not 
      significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of 
      premature rupture of membranes in the nontransfusion group was higher than that 
      in the transfusion group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the 
      fetal umbilical cord around neck, amniotic fluid index, and fetal heart rate 
      before operation in the blood transfusion group, but the thickness of uterine 
      anterior wall and the levels of Hb, PT, FIB, and TT in the blood transfusion 
      group were lower than those in the nontransfusion group, while the number of 
      placenta previa and the levels of PLT and APTT in the blood transfusion group 
      were higher than those in the nontransfusion group. The XGB prediction model 
      finally got the 8 most important features, in the order of importance from high 
      to low: preoperative Hb, operation time, anterior wall thickness of the lower 
      segment of uterus, uterine weakness, preoperative fetal heart, placenta previa, 
      ASA grade, and uterine contractile drugs. The higher the score, the greater the 
      impact on the model. There was a linear correlation between the 8 features 
      (including the correlation with the target blood transfusion). The indexes with 
      strong correlation with blood transfusion included the placenta previa, ASA 
      grade, operation time, uterine atony, and preoperative Hb. Placenta previa, ASA 
      grade, operation time, and uterine atony were positively correlated with blood 
      transfusion, while preoperative Hb was negatively correlated with blood 
      transfusion. In order to further compare the prediction ability of the three 
      machine learning methods, all the samples are randomly divided into two parts: 
      the first 75% training set and the last 25% test set. Then, the three models are 
      trained again on the training set, and at this time, the model does not come into 
      contact with the samples in any test set. After the model training, the trained 
      model was used to predict the test set, and the real blood transfusion status was 
      compared with the predicted value, and the F1, accuracy, recall rate, and AUROC4 
      indicators were checked. In terms of training samples and test samples, the AUROC 
      of XGB was higher than that of logistic regression, and the F1, accuracy, and 
      recall rate of XGB of ANN were also slightly higher than those of logistic 
      regression and ANN. Therefore, the performance of XGB algorithm is slightly 
      better than that of logistic regression and ANN. (2) According to the univariate 
      analysis of hypothermia during the recovery period of anesthesia, there were 
      significant differences in ASA grade, mode of anesthesia, infusion volume, blood 
      transfusion, and operation duration between the normal body temperature group and 
      hypothermia group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that ASA grade, 
      anesthesia mode, infusion volume, blood transfusion, and operation duration were 
      all risk factors of hypothermia during anesthesia recovery. CONCLUSION: In this 
      study, three machine learning algorithms were used to analyze the large sample of 
      clinical data and predict the results. It was found that five important 
      predictive variables of blood transfusion during recesarean section were 
      preoperative Hb, expected operation time, uterine weakness, placenta previa, and 
      ASA grade. By comparing the three algorithms, the prediction effect of XGB may be 
      more accurate than that of logistic regression and ANN. The model can provide 
      accurate individual prediction for patients and has good prediction performance 
      and has a good prospect of clinical application. Secondly, through the analysis 
      of the risk factors of hypothermia during the recovery period of cesarean 
      section, it is found that ASA grade, mode of anesthesia, amount of infusion, 
      blood transfusion, and operation time are all risk factors of hypothermia during 
      the recovery period of cesarean section. In line with this, the observation of 
      this kind of patients should be strengthened during cesarean section.

TI  - Predictive Analytics for Inpatient Postoperative Opioid Use in Patients 
      Undergoing Mastectomy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The use of opioids in mastectomy patients is a particular 
      challenge, having to balance the management of acute pain while minimizing risks 
      of continuous opioid use postoperatively. Despite attempts to decrease 
      postmastectomy opioid use, including regional anesthetics, gabapentinoids, 
      topical anesthetics, and nonopioid anesthesia, prolonged opioid use remains 
      clinically significant among these patients. The goal of this study is to 
      identify risk factors and develop machine-learning-based models to predict 
      patients who are at higher risk for postoperative opioid use after mastectomy. 
      METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we collected data from patients that 
      underwent mastectomy procedures. The primary outcome of interest was defined as 
      oxycodone milligram equivalents (OME) greater than or equal to the 75% of OME use 
      on a postoperative day 1. Model performance (area under the receiver-operating 
      characteristics curve (AUC)) of various machine learning approaches was 
      calculated via 10-fold cross-validation. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence 
      intervals (CI) were reported. RESULTS: There were a total of 148 patients that 
      underwent mastectomy and were included. The medium (quartiles) postoperative day 
      1 opioid use was 5 mg OME (0.25 mg OME). Using multivariable logistic regression, 
      the most protective factors against higher opioid use was being postmenopausal 
      (OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03-0.61, p = 0.009) and cancer diagnosis (OR: 0.19, 95% CI: 
      0.05-0.73, p = 0.01). The AUC was 0.725 (95% CI: 0.572-0.876). There was no 
      difference in the performance of other machine-learning-based approaches. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The ability to predict patients' postoperative pain could have a 
      significant impact on preoperative counseling and patient satisfaction.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Pathological Upgrade From Combined 
      Transperineal Systematic and MRI-Targeted Prostate Biopsy to Final Pathology: A 
      Multicenter Retrospective Study.
PG  - 785684

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the pathological concordance from 
      combined systematic and MRI-targeted prostate biopsy to final pathology and to 
      verify the effectiveness of a machine learning-based model with targeted biopsy 
      (TB) features in predicting pathological upgrade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 
      patients in this study underwent prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), 
      transperineal systematic plus transperineal targeted prostate biopsy under local 
      anesthesia, and robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP) for 
      prostate cancer (PCa) sequentially from October 2016 to February 2020 in two 
      referral centers. For cores with cancer, grade group (GG) and Gleason score were 
      determined by using the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) 
      guidelines. Four supervised machine learning methods were employed, including two 
      base classifiers and two ensemble learning-based classifiers. In all classifiers, 
      the training set was 395 of 565 (70%) patients, and the test set was the 
      remaining 170 patients. The prediction performance of each model was evaluated by 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The Gini index was 
      used to evaluate the importance of all features and to figure out the most 
      contributed features. A nomogram was established to visually predict the risk of 
      upgrading. Predicted probability was a prevalence rate calculated by a proposed 
      nomogram. RESULTS: A total of 515 patients were included in our cohort. The 
      combined biopsy had a better concordance of postoperative histopathology than a 
      systematic biopsy (SB) only (48.15% vs. 40.19%, p = 0.012). The combined biopsy 
      could significantly reduce the upgrading rate of postoperative pathology, in 
      comparison to SB only (23.30% vs. 39.61%, p < 0.0001) or TB only (23.30% vs. 
      40.19%, p < 0.0001). The most common pathological upgrade occurred in ISUP GG1 
      and GG2, accounting for 53.28% and 20.42%, respectively. All machine learning 
      methods had satisfactory predictive efficacy. The overall accuracy was 0.703, 
      0.768, 0.794, and 0.761 for logistic regression, random forest, eXtreme Gradient 
      Boosting, and support vector machine, respectively. TB-related features were 
      among the most contributed features of a prediction model for upgrade prediction. 
      CONCLUSION: The combined effect of SB plus TB led to a better pathological 
      concordance rate and less upgrading from biopsy to RP. Machine learning models 
      with features of TB to predict PCa GG upgrading have a satisfactory predictive 
      efficacy.

TI  - Approaching automated applicator digitization from a new angle: Using sagittal 
      images to improve deep learning accuracy and robustness in high-dose-rate 
      prostate brachytherapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To automate the segmentation of treatment applicators on computed 
      tomography (CT) images for high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy prostate patients 
      implanted with titanium needles with the goals of improving plan quality and 
      reducing the patient's time under anesthesia. METHODS: The investigation was 
      performed using 57 retrospective, interstitial prostate treatments randomly 
      assigned to training (n = 27), validation (n = 10), and testing (n = 20). Unique 
      to this work, the CT image set was reformatted into 2D sagittal slices instead of 
      the default axial orientation. A deep learning-based segmentation was performed 
      using a 2D U-Net architecture followed by a density-based linkage clustering 
      algorithm to classify individual catheters in 3D. Potential confounders, such as 
      gold seeds and conjoined applicators with intersecting needle geometries, were 
      corrected using a customized polynomial fitting algorithm. The geometric 
      agreement of the automated digitization was evaluated against the clinically 
      treated manual digitization to measure tip and shaft errors in the 
      reconstruction. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm achieved tip and shaft agreements 
      of -0.1 ± 0.6 mm (range -1.8 mm to 1.4 mm) and 0.13 ± 0.09 mm (maximum 0.96 mm), 
      respectively on a data set with 20 patients and 353 total needles. Our method was 
      able to separate all intersecting applicators reliably. The time to generate the 
      automated applicator digitization averaged approximately 1 min. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Using sagittal instead of axial images for 2D segmentation of interstitial 
      brachytherapy applicators produced submillimeter agreement with manual 
      segmentation. The automated digitization of interstitial applicators in prostate 
      brachytherapy has the potential to improve quality and consistency while reducing 
      the patient's time under anesthesia.

AB  - Monitoring the depth of unconsciousness during anesthesia is beneficial in both 
      clinical settings and neuroscience investigations to understand brain mechanisms. 
      Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as an objective means of characterizing 
      brain altered arousal and/or cognition states induced by anesthetics in 
      real-time. Different general anesthetics affect cerebral electrical activities in 
      different ways. However, the performance of conventional machine learning models 
      on EEG data is unsatisfactory due to the low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in the 
      EEG signals, especially in the office-based anesthesia EEG setting. Deep learning 
      models have been used widely in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to 
      perform classification and pattern recognition tasks due to their capability of 
      good generalization and handling noises. Compared to other BCI applications, 
      where deep learning has demonstrated encouraging results, the deep learning 
      approach for classifying different brain consciousness states under anesthesia 
      has been much less investigated. In this paper, we propose a new framework based 
      on meta-learning using deep neural networks, named Anes-MetaNet, to classify 
      brain states under anesthetics. The Anes-MetaNet is composed of Convolutional 
      Neural Networks (CNN) to extract power spectrum features, and a time consequence 
      model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture the temporal 
      dependencies, and a meta-learning framework to handle large cross-subject 
      variability. We use a multi-stage training paradigm to improve the performance, 
      which is justified by visualizing the high-level feature mapping. Experiments on 
      the office-based anesthesia EEG dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our 
      proposed Anes-MetaNet by comparison of existing methods.

AB  - In clinical anesthesia and the rescue of critically ill patients, arterial 
      puncture and catheterization are the most commonly chosen ways to establish 
      central arterial access for patients. Invasive arterial puncture and 
      catheterization facilitate the grasp of real-time vital sign information of 
      patients during surgery, which strengthens patient monitoring during surgery and 
      improves safety. However, the traditional method of arterial puncture and 
      cannulation through palpation of the radial artery is often prone to 
      complications related to mechanical injury, such as hemorrhage, hematoma, and 
      accidental perforation of the artery. Studies have shown that ultrasound-guided 
      radial artery puncture and cannulation can shorten the puncture cannulation time, 
      reduce the incidence of complications related to puncture cannulation, and 
      improve the success rate of puncture cannulation. In order to verify it, this 
      paper uses the experimental group and the control group to conduct comparative 
      experiments and uses the neural network method to evaluate the effects of the two 
      methods. As a more mature method of artificial intelligence, BP neural network is 
      widely used in a wide range of applications and has the characteristics of strong 
      generalization ability and fast convergence, so we choose it as the base model. 
      The specific work of this paper is as follows: (1) in-depth study of the relevant 
      theory of BP neural network (BPNN), focusing on the structure of BPNN and the 
      working principle of algorithm; the problems to be solved in the clinical 
      anesthesia effect evaluation have laid a theoretical foundation for the 
      establishment of an improved BPNN evaluation model in the following chapters. (2) 
      introduce the basic principle of genetic neural network, analyze the benefits of 
      combining genetic neural network and BPNN; introduce in detail the process of 
      genetic algorithm to optimize the weights and thresholds of BPNN, and establish a 
      GA-BP evaluation model. The test proves the feasibility and superiority of the 
      model.

AB  - Adolescents and children worldwide are threatened by osteosarcoma, a tumor that 
      predominantly affects the long bone epiphysis. Osteosarcoma is the most common 
      and highly malignant bone tumor in youngsters. Early tumor detection is the key 
      to effective treatment of this disease. The discovery of biomarkers and the 
      growing understanding of molecules and their complex interactions have improved 
      the outcome of clinical trials in osteosarcoma. This article describes biomarkers 
      of osteosarcoma with the aim of positively influencing the progress of clinical 
      treatment of osteosarcoma. Femoral bone tumor is a typical condition of 
      osteosarcoma. Due to the wide range of femoral stem types, complexities in the 
      distal femur, and tumors in the rotor part of femur, physicians following the 
      traditional clinical approach face difficulties in removing the lesion and fixing 
      the femur with resection of the tumor segment. In this paper, the effect of small 
      doses of different concentrations of lidocaine anesthesia in patients undergoing 
      lumpectomy for osteosarcoma femoral tumor segments is investigated. A 
      computer-based artificial intelligence method for automated determination of 
      different concentration levels of lidocaine anesthesia and amputation of 
      osteosarcoma femoral tumor segment is proposed. Statistical analysis is carried 
      on the empirical data including intraoperative bleeding, intraoperative and 
      postoperative pain scores, surgical operation time, postoperative complications, 
      patient satisfaction, and local anesthetic dose. The results showed that the 
      patients in the study group had low intraoperative bleeding, short operation 
      time, low postoperative hematoma formation rate, high patient satisfaction, 
      higher dosage of anesthetic solution, and low dosage of lidocaine. Results 
      revealed that mean arterial pressure and heart rate in extubating and intubating 
      were significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group, and 
      a significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed between the two groups. This 
      proves that the proposed algorithm can adequately reduce bleeding, alleviate 
      postoperative pain, shorten operation time, reduce complications, accelerate 
      recovery, and ensure better treatment results.

AB  - Characterization and prediction of individual difference of pain sensitivity are 
      of great importance in clinical practice. MRI techniques, such as functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), have been 
      popularly used to predict an individual's pain sensitivity, but existing studies 
      are limited by using one single imaging modality (fMRI or DTI) and/or using one 
      type of metrics (regional or connectivity features). As a result, pain-relevant 
      information in MRI has not been fully revealed and the associations among 
      different imaging modalities and different features have not been fully explored 
      for elucidating pain sensitivity. In this study, we investigated the predictive 
      capability of multi-features (regional and connectivity metrics) of multimodal 
      MRI (fMRI and DTI) in the prediction of pain sensitivity using data from 210 
      healthy subjects. We found that fusing fMRI-DTI and regional-connectivity 
      features are capable of more accurately predicting an individual's pain 
      sensitivity than only using one type of feature or using one imaging modality. 
      These results revealed rich information regarding individual pain sensitivity 
      from the brain's both structural and functional perspectives as well as from both 
      regional and connectivity metrics. Hence, this study provided a more 
      comprehensive characterization of the neural correlates of individual pain 
      sensitivity, which holds a great potential for clinical pain management.

TI  - Artificial intelligence to evaluate postoperative pain based on facial expression 
      recognition.
PG  - 1282-1291
LID - 10.1002/ejp.1948 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain intensity evaluation by self-report is difficult and biased in 
      non-communicating people, which may contribute to inappropriate pain management. 
      The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate pain intensity based on 
      automated facial expression analysis has not been evaluated in clinical 
      conditions. METHODS: We trained and externally validated a deep-learning system 
      (ResNet-18 convolutional neural network) to identify and classify 2810 facial 
      expressions of 1189 patients, captured before and after surgery, according to 
      their self-reported pain intensity using numeric rating scale (NRS, 0-10). AI 
      performances were evaluated by accuracy (concordance between AI prediction and 
      patient-reported pain intensity), sensitivity and specificity to diagnose pain 
      ≥4/10 and ≥7/10. We then confronted AI performances with those of 33 nurses to 
      evaluate pain intensity from facial expression in the same situation. RESULTS: In 
      the external testing set (120 face images), the deep learning system was able to 
      predict exactly the pain intensity among the 11 possible scores (0-10) in 53% of 
      the cases with a mean error of 2.4 points. Its sensitivities to detect pain ≥4/10 
      and ≥7/10 were 89.7% and 77.5%, respectively. Nurses estimated the right NRS pain 
      intensity with a mean accuracy of 14.9% and identified pain ≥4/10 and ≥7/10 with 
      sensitivities of 44.9% and 17.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Subject to further improvement of 
      AI performances through further training, these results suggest that AI using 
      facial expression analysis could be used to assist physicians to evaluate pain 
      and detect severe pain, especially in people not able to report appropriately 
      their pain by themselves. SIGNIFICANCE: These original findings represent a major 
      step in the development of a fully automated, rapid, standardized and objective 
      method based on facial expression analysis to measure pain and detect severe 
      pain.

TI  - Oral appliance therapy for obstructive sleep apnea in multiple system atrophy 
      with floppy epiglottis: a case series of three patients.
PG  - 213-219
LID - 10.1007/s11325-022-02607-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A recent study demonstrated that continuous positive airway pressure 
      (CPAP) may exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with multiple 
      system atrophy (MSA) and a floppy epiglottis (FE) as the CPAP promotes downward 
      displacement of the epiglottis into the laryngeal inlet. In this case series, we 
      examined the effectiveness of an oral appliance (OA) for treating OSA in three 
      patients with MSA and an FE. METHODS: Patients with MSA were demonstrated to have 
      an FE on fiberoptic laryngoscopy under sedation using intravenous propofol. The 
      therapeutic intervention was fitting an OA. Polysomnography (PSG) was performed 
      subsequently with the OA in place. RESULTS: In three patients with MSA, some 
      parameters used to assess the severity of OSA improved with an OA. Both 
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and arousal index (ArI) decreased while wearing the OA 
      in two cases while in the third case, apnea index (AI) and cumulative time at 
      peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) below 90% (CT90) decreased, but AHI and ArI 
      increased. The only side effects were transient TMJ discomfort, masseter muscle 
      pain, and tooth discomfort. CONCLUSION: OA therapy using a two-piece type 
      mandibular advancement device (MAD) may be a useful treatment intervention for 
      patients with OSA who have MSA and FE.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in perioperative medicine: a narrative review.
PG  - 202-215

AB  - Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have enabled the 
      development of accurate prediction models using clinical big data. AI models for 
      perioperative risk stratification, intraoperative event prediction, biosignal 
      analyses, and intensive care medicine have been developed in the field of 
      perioperative medicine. Some of these models have been validated using external 
      datasets and randomized controlled trials. Once these models are implemented in 
      electronic health record systems or software medical devices, they could help 
      anesthesiologists improve clinical outcomes by accurately predicting 
      complications and suggesting optimal treatment strategies in real-time. This 
      review provides an overview of the AI techniques used in perioperative medicine 
      and a summary of the studies that have been published using these techniques. 
      Understanding these techniques will aid in their appropriate application in 
      clinical practice.

TI  - Identification of a Novel FAM83H Mutation and Management of Hypocalcified 
      Amelogenesis Imperfecta in Early Childhood.
LID - 10.3390/children9030429 [doi]
LID - 429
AB  - Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a heterogeneous group of rare genetic disorders 
      affecting amelogenesis during dental development. Therefore, the molecular 
      genetic etiology of AI can provide information about the nature and progress of 
      the disease. To confirm the genetic etiology of AI in a Korean family with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance, pedigree and mutational analyses were performed. 
      DNA was isolated from the participating family members and whole-exome sequencing 
      was performed with the DNA sample of the father of the proband. The identified 
      mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The mutational analysis revealed a 
      novel nonsense mutation in the FAM83H gene (NM_198488.5: c.1363C > T, 
      p.(Gln455*)), confirming autosomal dominant hypocalcified AI. Full-mouth 
      restorative treatments of the affected children were performed after the 
      completion of the deciduous dentition. Early diagnosis of AI can be useful for 
      understanding the nature of the disease and for managing the condition and 
      treatment planning.

TI  - The Analysis of Pain Research through the Lens of Artificial Intelligence and 
      Machine Learning.
PG  - E211-E243
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional pain assessment methods have significant limitations due 
      to the high variability in patient reported pain scores and perception of pain by 
      different individuals. There is a need for generalized and automatic pain 
      detection and recognition methods. In this paper, state-of-the-art machine 
      learning (ML) and deep learning methods in this field are analyzed as well as 
      pain management techniques. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to analyze 
      the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML in the analysis and 
      management of pain and to disseminate this knowledge prompting future utilization 
      by medical professionals. STUDY DESIGN: A narrative review of the literature 
      focusing on the latest algorithms in AI and ML for pain assessment and 
      management. METHODS: Research studies were collected using a literature search on 
      PubMed, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore between 2018 and 2020. RESULTS: The 
      results of our assessment resulted in the identification of 47 studies meeting 
      inclusion criteria. Pain assessment was the most studied subject with 11 studies, 
      followed by automated measurements with 10 studies, spinal diagnosis with 8 
      studies, facial expression with 7 studies, pain assessment in special settings 
      evaluated in 5 studies, 4 studies described treatment algorithms, and 2 studies 
      assessed neonatal pain. These studies varied from simple to highly complex 
      methodology. The majority of the studies suffered from inclusion of a small 
      number of patients and without replication of results. However, considering AI 
      and ML are dynamic and emerging specialties, the results shown here are 
      promising. Consequently, we have described all the available literature in 
      summary formats with commentary. Among the various assessments, facial expression 
      and spinal diagnosis and management appear to be ready for inclusion as we 
      continue to progress. LIMITATIONS: This review is not a systematic review of ML 
      and AI applications in pain research. This review only provides a general idea of 
      the upcoming techniques but does not provide an authoritative evidence-based 
      conclusive opinion of their clinical application and effectiveness. CONCLUSION: 
      While a majority of the studies focused on classification tasks, very few studies 
      have explored the diagnosis and management of pain. Usage of ML techniques as 
      support tools for clinicians holds an immense potential in the field of pain 
      management.

TI  - A Pilot Study Implementing a Machine Learning Algorithm to Use Artificial 
      Intelligence to Diagnose Spinal Conditions.
PG  - 171-178
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic spinal pain is the most prevalent chronic disease, with 
      chronic persistent spinal pain lasting longer than one-year reported in 25% to 
      60% of the patients. Health care expenditures have been escalating and the 
      financial impact on the US economy is growing. Among multiple modalities of 
      treatments available, facet joint interventions and epidural interventions are 
      the most common ones, in addition to surgical interventions and numerous other 
      conservative modalities of treatments. Despite these increasing costs in the 
      diagnosis and management, disability continues to increase. Consequently, 
      algorithmic approaches have been described as providing a disciplined approach to 
      the use of spinal interventional techniques in managing spinal pain. This 
      approach includes evaluative, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches, which 
      avoids unnecessary care, as well as poorly documented practices.  Recently, 
      techniques involving artificial intelligence and machine learning have been 
      demonstrated to contribute to the improved understanding, diagnosis, and 
      management of both acute and chronic disease in line with well-designed 
      algorithmic approach. The use of artificial intelligence and machine-learning 
      techniques for the diagnosis of spinal pain has not been widely investigated or 
      adopted. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether it is possible to use artificial 
      intelligence via machine learning algorithms to analyze specific data points and 
      to predict the most likely diagnosis related to spinal pain. STUDY DESIGN: This 
      was a prospective, observational pilot study. SETTING: A single pain management 
      center in the United States. METHODS: A total of 246 consecutive patients with 
      spinal pain were enrolled. Patients were given an iPad to complete a Google form 
      with 85 specific data points, including demographic information, type of pain, 
      pain score, pain location, pain duration, and functional status scores. The data 
      were then input into a decision tree machine learning software program that 
      attempted to learn which data points were most likely to correspond to the 
      practitioner-assigned diagnosis. These outcomes were then compared with the 
      practitioner-assigned diagnosis in the chart. RESULTS: The average age of the 
      included patients was 57.4 years (range, 18-91 years). The majority of patients 
      were women and the average pain history was approximately 2 years. The most 
      common practitioner-assigned diagnoses included lumbar radiculopathy and lumbar 
      facet disease/spondylosis. Comparison of the software-predicted diagnosis based 
      on reported symptoms with practitioner-assigned diagnosis revealed that the 
      software was accurate approximately 72% of the time. LIMITATIONS: Additional 
      studies are needed to expand the data set, confirm the predictive ability of the 
      data set, and determine whether it is broadly applicable across pain practices. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Software-predicted diagnoses based on the data from patients with 
      spinal pain had an accuracy rate of 72%, suggesting promise for augmented 
      decision making using artificial intelligence in this setting.

TI  - Visualizing Opioid-Use Variation in a Pediatric Perioperative Dashboard.
PG  - 370-379
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1744387 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anesthesiologists integrate numerous variables to determine an opioid 
      dose that manages patient nociception and pain while minimizing adverse effects. 
      Clinical dashboards that enable physicians to compare themselves to their peers 
      can reduce unnecessary variation in patient care and improve outcomes. However, 
      due to the complexity of anesthetic dosing decisions, comparative visualizations 
      of opioid-use patterns are complicated by case-mix differences between providers. 
      OBJECTIVES: This single-institution case study describes the development of a 
      pediatric anesthesia dashboard and demonstrates how advanced computational 
      techniques can facilitate nuanced normalization techniques, enabling meaningful 
      comparisons of complex clinical data. METHODS: We engaged perioperative-care 
      stakeholders at a tertiary care pediatric hospital to determine patient and 
      surgical variables relevant to anesthesia decision-making and to identify 
      end-user requirements for an opioid-use visualization tool. Case data were 
      extracted, aggregated, and standardized. We performed multivariable machine 
      learning to identify and understand key variables. We integrated interview 
      findings and computational algorithms into an interactive dashboard with 
      normalized comparisons, followed by an iterative process of improvement and 
      implementation. RESULTS: The dashboard design process identified two 
      mechanisms-interactive data filtration and machine-learning-based 
      normalization-that enable rigorous monitoring of opioid utilization with 
      meaningful case-mix adjustment. When deployed with real data encompassing 24,332 
      surgical cases, our dashboard identified both high and low opioid-use outliers 
      with associated clinical outcomes data. CONCLUSION: A tool that gives 
      anesthesiologists timely data on their practice patterns while adjusting for 
      case-mix differences empowers physicians to track changes and variation in opioid 
      administration over time. Such a tool can successfully trigger conversation 
      amongst stakeholders in support of continuous improvement efforts. Clinical 
      analytics dashboards can enable physicians to better understand their practice 
      and provide motivation to change behavior, ultimately addressing unnecessary 
      variation in high impact medication use and minimizing adverse effects.

AB  - Despite the relevance of pressure ulcers (PU) in inpatient care, the predictive 
      power and role of care-related risk factors (e.g. anesthesia) remain unclear. We 
      investigated the predictability of PU incidence and its association with multiple 
      care variables. We included all somatic cases between 2014 and 2018 with length 
      of stay ≥ 2d in a German university hospital. For regression analyses and 
      prediction we used Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) as nonparametric 
      modeling approach. To assess predictive accuracy, we compared BART, random 
      forest, logistic regression (LR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection 
      operator (LASSO) using area under the curve (AUC), confusion matrices and 
      multiple indicators of predictive performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, F1, 
      positive/ negative predictive value) in the full dataset and subgroups. Analysing 
      149,006 cases revealed high predictive variable importance and associations 
      between incident PU and ventilation, age, anesthesia (≥ 1 h) and number of 
      care-involved wards. Despite high AUCs (range 0.89-0.90), many false negative 
      predictions led to low sensitivity (range 0.04-0.10). Ventilation, age, 
      anesthesia and number of care-involved wards were associated with incident PU. 
      Using anesthesia as a proxy for immobility, an hourly repositioning is indicated. 
      The low sensitivity indicates major challenges for correctly predicting PU based 
      on routine data.

AB  - Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has largely penetrated our 
      daily life. Hence, our expectations regarding clinical AI are very high. However, 
      in healthcare and especially in perioperative medicine, the impact of AI is still 
      relatively limited. This is in contrast with an exponential increase in the 
      academic investment and productivity in this field of data science. 
      Implementation challenges are numerous, including technological and regulatory 
      challenges. In addition, the clinical and economic impact of deploying clinical 
      AI at scale is still lacking. However, if these implementation challenges are 
      properly addressed, the potential of AI to profoundly transform our practice is 
      real. If successfully implemented and integrated into the clinical workflow, 
      AI-assisted perioperative medicine could become more preventative and 
      personalized. However, AI implementation is not the final step. New challenges 
      will follow implementation including algorithm maintenance, continuous 
      monitoring, and improvement.

TI  - Understanding People With Chronic Pain Who Use a Cognitive Behavioral 
      Therapy-Based Artificial Intelligence Mental Health App (Wysa): Mixed Methods 
      Retrospective Observational Study.
PG  - e35671
LID - 10.2196/35671 [doi]
LID - e35671
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions can bridge barriers in access to 
      treatment among individuals with chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to 
      evaluate the perceived needs, engagement, and effectiveness of the mental health 
      app Wysa with regard to mental health outcomes among real-world users who 
      reported chronic pain and engaged with the app for support. METHODS: Real-world 
      data from users (N=2194) who reported chronic pain and associated health 
      conditions in their conversations with the mental health app were examined using 
      a mixed methods retrospective observational study. An inductive thematic analysis 
      was used to analyze the conversational data of users with chronic pain to assess 
      perceived needs, along with comparative macro-analyses of conversational flows to 
      capture engagement within the app. Additionally, the scores from a subset of 
      users who completed a set of pre-post assessment questionnaires, namely Patient 
      Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (n=69) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
      Assessment-7 (GAD-7) (n=57), were examined to evaluate the effectiveness of Wysa 
      in providing support for mental health concerns among those managing chronic 
      pain. RESULTS: The themes emerging from the conversations of users with chronic 
      pain included health concerns, socioeconomic concerns, and pain management 
      concerns. Findings from the quantitative analysis indicated that users with 
      chronic pain showed significantly greater app engagement (P<.001) than users 
      without chronic pain, with a large effect size (Vargha and Delaney A=0.76-0.80). 
      Furthermore, users with pre-post assessments during the study period were found 
      to have significant improvements in group means for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 symptom 
      scores, with a medium effect size (Cohen d=0.60-0.61). CONCLUSIONS: The findings 
      indicate that users look for tools that can help them address their concerns 
      related to mental health, pain management, and sleep issues. The study findings 
      also indicate the breadth of the needs of users with chronic pain and the lack of 
      support structures, and suggest that Wysa can provide effective support to bridge 
      the gap.

AB  - The progress of critical care medicine in 2021 is still encouraging. The new 
      international guideline for management of sepsis and septic shock came out after 
      4 years. Besides, a couple of preferable clinical evidences were released 
      including restrictive blood transfusion strategy for patients with acute 
      myocardial infarction, prevention of peripheral venous catheter infection, 
      heparin inhalation and driving pressure setting in patients with acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lower oxygenation target for acute 
      hypoxemic respiratory failure, low level positive end-expiratory pressure in 
      non-ARDS patients with respiratory failure, light sedation or non-sedation 
      strategy, biological phenotypes, as well machine learning in sepsis and ARDS. 
      However, we also encounter negative results such as balanced solution during 
      fluid resuscitation, hypothermia therapy after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or 
      traumatic brain injury, adrenomedullin-specific antibody adrecizumab therapy and 
      coupled plasma filtration-adsorption (CPFA) therapy for patients with septic 
      shock, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO(2)R) implementation in acute 
      hypoxic respiratory failure, continuous infusion of hypertonic saline in patients 
      with traumatic brain injury. Collectively, in the future, individualized 
      diagnosis and management based on the principle of "wise choice" will become the 
      daily practice scene for all intensivists.

AB  - Objective To develop a risk prediction model combining pre/intraoperative risk 
      factors and intraoperative vital signs for postoperative healthcare-associated 
      infection(HAI)based on deep learning. Methods We carried out a retrospective 
      study based on two randomized controlled 
      trials(NCT02715076,ChiCTR-IPR-17011099).The patients who underwent elective 
      radical resection of advanced digestive system tumor were included in this 
      study.The primary outcome was HAI within 30 days after surgery.Logistic 
      regression analysis and long short-term memory(LSTM)model based on iteratively 
      occluding sections of the input were used for feature selection.The risk 
      prediction model for postoperative HAI was developed based on deep 
      learning,combining the selected pre/intraoperative risk factors and 
      intraoperative vital signs,and was evaluated by comparison with other 
      models.Finally,we adopted the simulated annealing algorithm to simulatively 
      adjust the vital signs during surgery,trying to explore the adjustment system 
      that can reduce the risk of HAI. Results A total of 839 patients were included in 
      this study,of which 112(13.3%)developed HAI within 30 days after surgery.The 
      selected pre/intraoperative risk factors included neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy,parenteral nutrition,esophagectomy,gastrectomy,colorectal 
      resection,pancreatoduodenectomy,hepatic resection,intraoperative blood loss>500 
      ml,and anesthesia time>4 h.The intraoperative vital signs significantly 
      associated with HAI were in an order of heart rate>core body temperature>systolic 
      blood pressure>diastolic blood pressure.Compared with multivariable Logistic 
      regression model,random forest model,and LSTM model including vital signs 
      only,this deep learning-based prediction model performed 
      best(ACC=0.733,F1=0.237,AUC=0.728).The simulation via simulated annealing 
      algorithm reduced the incidence of postoperative HAI.Moreover,the incidence 
      decreased most in the case of reducing the initial annealing temperature and 
      choosing the last 20% of surgery procedure. Conclusions This study developed a 
      risk prediction model for postoperative HAI based on deep learning,which combined

AB  - Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to diagnostic, 
      therapeutic, and intervention-based applications in the field of medicine. Today, 
      there is a deep chasm between AI-based research articles and their translation to 
      clinical anesthesia, which needs to be addressed. Machine learning (ML), the most 
      widely applied arm of AI in medicine, confers the ability to analyze large 
      volumes of data, find associations, and predict outcomes with ongoing learning by 
      the computer. It involves algorithm creation, testing and analyses with the 
      ability to perform cognitive functions including association between variables, 
      pattern recognition, and prediction of outcomes. AI-supported closed loops have 
      been designed for pharmacological maintenance of anesthesia and hemodynamic 
      management. Mechanical robots can perform dexterity and skill-based tasks such as 
      intubation and regional blocks with precision, whereas clinical-decision support 
      systems in crisis situations may augment the role of the clinician. The 
      possibilities are boundless, yet widespread adoption of AI is still far from the 
      ground reality. Patient-related "Big Data" collection, validation, transfer, and 
      testing are under ethical scrutiny. For this narrative review, we conducted a 
      PubMed search in 2020-21 and retrieved articles related to AI and anesthesia. 
      After careful consideration of the content, we prepared the review to highlight 
      the growing importance of AI in anesthesia. Awareness and understanding of the 
      basics of AI are the first steps to be undertaken by clinicians. In this 
      narrative review, we have discussed salient features of ongoing AI research 
      related to anesthesia and perioperative care.

TI  - Machine learning based forecast for the prediction of inpatient bed demand.
PG  - 55
LID - 10.1186/s12911-022-01787-9 [doi]
LID - 55
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overcrowding is a serious problem that impacts the ability to provide 
      optimal level of care in a timely manner. High patient volume is known to 
      increase the boarding time at the emergency department (ED), as well as at 
      post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Furthermore, the same high volume increases 
      inpatient bed transfer times, which causes delays in elective surgeries, 
      increases the probability of near misses, patient safety incidents, and adverse 
      events. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to develop a Machine Learning 
      (ML) based strategy to predict weekly forecasts of the inpatient bed demand in 
      order to assist the resource planning for the ED and PACU, resulting in a more 
      efficient utilization. METHODS: The data utilized included all adult inpatient 
      encounters at Geisinger Medical Center (GMC) for the last 5 years. The variables 
      considered were class of inpatient encounter, observation, or surgical overnight 
      recovery (SORU) at the time of their discharge. The ML based strategy is built 
      using the K-means clustering method and the Support Vector Machine Regression 
      technique (K-SVR). RESULTS: The performance obtained by the K-SVR strategy in the 
      retrospective cohort amounts to a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) that 
      ranges between 0.49 and 4.10% based on the test period. Additionally, results 
      present a reduced variability, which translates into more stable forecasting 
      results. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study demonstrate the capacity of ML 
      techniques to forecast inpatient bed demand, particularly using K-SVR. It is 
      expected that the implementation of this model in the workflow of bed capacity 
      management will create efficiencies, which will translate in a more reliable, 
      inexpensive and timely care for patients.

AB  - Consciousness can be defined by two components: arousal (wakefulness) and 
      awareness (subjective experience). However, neurophysiological consciousness 
      metrics able to disentangle between these components have not been reported. 
      Here, we propose an explainable consciousness indicator (ECI) using deep learning 
      to disentangle the components of consciousness. We employ electroencephalographic 
      (EEG) responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation under various conditions, 
      including sleep (n = 6), general anesthesia (n = 16), and severe brain injury 
      (n = 34). We also test our framework using resting-state EEG under general 
      anesthesia (n = 15) and severe brain injury (n = 34). ECI simultaneously 
      quantifies arousal and awareness under physiological, pharmacological, and 
      pathological conditions. Particularly, ketamine-induced anesthesia and rapid eye 
      movement sleep with low arousal and high awareness are clearly distinguished from 
      other states. In addition, parietal regions appear most relevant for quantifying 
      arousal and awareness. This indicator provides insights into the neural 
      correlates of altered states of consciousness.

TI  - Artificial Neural Networks Can Predict Early Failure of Cementless Total Hip 
      Arthroplasty in Patients With Osteoporosis.
PG  - 467-475
LID - 10.5435/JAAOS-D-21-00775 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) done in the aging population is 
      associated with osteoporosis-related complications. The altered bone density in 
      osteoporotic patients is a risk factor for revision surgery. This study aimed to 
      develop and validate machine learning (ML) models to predict revision surgery in 
      patients with osteoporosis after primary noncemented THA. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of 350 patients with osteoporosis 
      (T-score less than or equal to -2.5) who underwent primary noncemented THA at a 
      tertiary referral center. All patients had a minimum 2-year follow-up (range: 2.1 
      to 5.6). Four ML algorithms were developed to predict the probability of revision 
      surgery, and these were assessed by discrimination, calibration, and decision 
      curve analysis. RESULTS: The overall incidence of revision surgery was 5.2% at a 
      mean follow-up of 3.7 years after primary noncemented THA in osteoporotic 
      patients. Revision THA was done because of periprosthetic fracture in nine 
      patients (50%), aseptic loosening/subsidence in five patients (28%), 
      periprosthetic joint infection in two patients (11%) and dislocation in two 
      patients (11%). The strongest predictors for revision surgery in patients after 
      primary noncemented THA were female sex, BMI (>35 kg/m2), age (>70 years), 
      American Society of Anesthesiology score (≥3), and T-score. All four ML models 
      demonstrated good model performance across discrimination (AUC range: 0.78 to 
      0.81), calibration, and decision curve analysis. CONCLUSION: The ML models 
      presented in this study demonstrated high accuracy for the prediction of revision 
      surgery in osteoporotic patients after primary noncemented THA. The presented ML 
      models have the potential to be used by orthopaedic surgeons for preoperative 
      patient counseling and optimization to improve the outcomes of primary 
      noncemented THA in osteoporotic patients.

AB  - During general anesthesia, how to judge the patient's muscle relaxation state has 
      always been one of the most significant issues for anesthesiologists. 
      Train-of-four ratio (TOFR) monitoring is a standard method, which can only obtain 
      static data to judge the current situation of muscle relaxation. Cisatracurium is 
      a nondepolarizing benzylisoquinoline muscle relaxant. Real-time prediction of 
      TOFR could help anesthesiologists to evaluate the duration and recovery profile 
      of cisatracurium. TOFR of cisatracurium could be regarded as temporal sequence 
      data, which could be processed and predicted using RNN based deep learning 
      methods. In this work, we performed RNN, GRU, and LSTM models for TOFR 
      prediction. We used transfer learning based on patient similarity derived from 
      BMI and age to achieve real-time and patient-specific prediction. The GRU model 
      achieved the best performance. In transfer learning, the model chosen based on 
      patient similarity has significantly outperformed the model chosen randomly. Our 
      work verified the feasibility of real-time prediction for TOFR of cisatracurium, 
      which had practical significance in general anesthesia. Meanwhile, using the 
      patient demographic data in transfer learning, our work could also achieve the 
      patient-specific prediction, having theoretical value for the clinical research 
      of precision medicine.

AB  - The use of large data sources such as registries and claims-based data sets to 
      perform health services research in anesthesia has increased considerably, 
      ultimately informing clinical decisions, supporting evaluation of policy or 
      intervention changes, and guiding further research. These observational data 
      sources come with limitations that must be addressed to effectively examine all 
      aspects of health care services and generate new individual- and population-level 
      knowledge. Several statistical methods are growing in popularity to address these 
      limitations, with the goal of mitigating confounding and other biases. In this 
      article, we provide a brief overview of common statistical methods used in health 
      services research when using observational data sources, guidance on their 
      interpretation, and examples of how they have been applied to anesthesia-related 
      health services research. Methods described involve regression, propensity 
      scoring, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, interrupted time 
      series, and machine learning.

AB  - The application of novel technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine 
      learning (ML) and telemedicine in anesthesiology could play a role in 
      transforming the future of health care. In the present review we discuss the 
      current applications of AI and telemedicine in anesthesiology and perioperative 
      care, exploring their potential influence and the possible hurdles. AI 
      technologies have the potential to deeply impact all phases of perioperative care 
      from accurate risk prediction to operating room organization, leading to 
      increased cost-effective care quality and better outcomes. Telemedicine is 
      reported as a successful mean within the anesthetic pathway, including 
      preoperative evaluation, remote patient monitoring, and postoperative care. The 
      utilization of AI and telemedicine is promising encouraging results in 
      perioperative management, nevertheless several hurdles remain to be overcome 
      before these tools could be integrated in our daily practice. AI models and 
      telemedicine can significantly influence all phases of perioperative care, 
      helping physicians in the development of precision medicine.

AB  - Anesthesia, perioperative and critical care medicine are specific areas where 
      registries, biobanks and big data are gaining a leading role in increasing 
      knowledge and improving patients' care. The adoption of these robust data 
      infrastructures - aimed at bridling, manipulating, aggregating, and linking 
      patients' multiparametric data - supports anesthesiologists and intensive care 
      physicians in several aspects of bedside practice and clinical research. Indeed, 
      registries-integrated calculators may promote the concept of personalized 
      medicine acting as "sniffers," electronic alarm systems, or decision support 
      systems. Artificial intelligence applied to large databases or meta-registries 
      may further increase dramatically this functionality, identify associations among 
      thousands of different and only apparently uncorrelated variables. From a 
      research perspective, large datasets are increasingly mined to create 
      observations about medical care beyond prospective randomized clinical trials 
      enrolling thousands of patients, often only presumably homogeneous ore 
      well-balanced. Registries in this context may effectively explore the association 
      between patients' management and patients' outcomes with a negligible impact on 
      ethical issues, limited costs, and easy management. Finally, registries may 
      promote self-evaluation and continuous quality improvement in the field of 
      perioperative and critical care medicine. In a different way, the role of 
      biobanks primarily relies on translational medical research. These allow rapidly 
      creating pools of biological samples available for epidemiological description, 
      pathophysiological definition, and treatment effectiveness verification, 
      basically acting as an accelerator of knowledge production in critical care and 
      perioperative medicine. Nowadays, registries and biobanks are thus routine tools 
      for anesthesiologists and critical care physicians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: How conscious experience becomes disconnected from the environment, 
      or disappears, across arousal states is unknown. We sought to identify the neural 
      correlates of sensory disconnection and unconsciousness using a novel serial 
      awakening paradigm. METHODS: Volunteers were recruited for sedation with 
      dexmedetomidine i.v., propofol i.v., or natural sleep with high-density EEG 
      monitoring and serial awakenings to establish whether subjects were in states of 
      disconnected consciousness or unconsciousness in the preceding 20 s. The primary 
      outcome was classification of conscious states by occipital delta power (0.5-4 
      Hz). Secondary analyses included derivation (dexmedetomidine) and validation 
      (sleep/propofol) studies of EEG signatures of conscious states. RESULTS: 
      Occipital delta power differentiated disconnected and unconscious states for 
      dexmedetomidine (area under the curve [AUC] for receiver operating characteristic 
      0.605 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.516; 0.694]) but not for sleep/propofol 
      (AUC 0.512 [95% CI: 0.380; 0.645]). Distinct source localised signatures of 
      sensory disconnection (AUC 0.999 [95% CI: 0.9954; 1.0000]) and unconsciousness 
      (AUC 0.972 [95% CI: 0.9507; 0.9879]) were identified using support vector machine 
      classification of dexmedetomidine data. These findings generalised to 
      sleep/propofol (validation data set: sensory disconnection [AUC 0.743 {95% CI: 
      0.6784; 0.8050}]) and unconsciousness (AUC 0.622 [95% CI: 0.5176; 0.7238]). We 
      identified that sensory disconnection was associated with broad spatial and 
      spectral changes. In contrast, unconsciousness was associated with focal 
      decreases in activity in anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings may enable novel monitors of the anaesthetic state that can 
      distinguish sensory disconnection and unconsciousness, and these may provide 
      novel insights into the biology of arousal. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Detecting drug diversion in health-system data using machine learning and 
      advanced analytics.
PG  - 1345-1354
LID - 10.1093/ajhp/zxac035 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The theft of drugs from healthcare facilities, also known as drug 
      diversion, occurs frequently but is often undetected. This paper describes a 
      research study to develop and test novel drug diversion detection methods. 
      Improved diversion detection and reduction in diversion improves patient safety, 
      limits harm to the person diverting, reduces the public health impact of 
      substance use disorder, and mitigates significant liability risk to pharmacists 
      and their organizations. METHODS: Ten acute care inpatient hospitals across 4 
      independent health systems extracted 2 datasets from various health information 
      technology systems. Both datasets were consolidated, normalized, classified, and 
      sampled to provide a harmonious dataset for analysis. Supervised machine learning 
      methods were iteratively used on the initial sample dataset to train algorithms 
      to classify medication movement transactions as involving a low or high risk of 
      diversion. Thereafter, the resulting machine learning model classified the risk 
      of diversion in a historical dataset capturing 8 to 24 months of history that 
      included 27.9 million medication movement transactions by 19,037 nursing, 1,047 
      pharmacy, and 712 anesthesia clinicians and that included 22 known, blinded 
      diversion cases to measure when the model would have detected the diversion 
      compared to when the diversion was actually detected by existing methods. 
      RESULTS: The machine learning model had 96.3% accuracy, 95.9% specificity, and 
      96.6% sensitivity in detecting transactions involving a high risk of diversion 
      using the initial sample dataset. In subsequent testing using the much larger 
      historical dataset, the analytics detected known diversion cases (n = 22) in 
      blinded data faster than existing detection methods (a mean of 160 days and a 
      median of 74 days faster; range, 7-579 days faster). CONCLUSION: The study showed 
      that (1) consolidated datasets and (2) supervised machine learning can detect 
      known diversion cases faster than existing detection methods. Users of the 
      technology also noted improved investigation efficiency.

AB  - METHODS: We compare nine index values, select CNN+EEG, which has good correlation 
      with BIS index, as an anesthesia state observation index to identify the 
      parameters of the model, and establish a model based on self-attention and dual 
      resistructure convolutional neural network. The data of 93 groups of patients 
      were selected and randomly grouped into three parts: training set, validation 
      set, and test set, and compared the best and worst results predicted by BIS. 
      RESULT: The best result is that the model's accuracy of predicting BLS on the 
      test set has an overall upward trend, eventually reaching more than 90%. The 
      overall error shows a gradual decrease and eventually approaches zero. The worst 
      result is that the model's accuracy of predicting BIS on the test set has an 
      overall upward trend. The accuracy rate is relatively stable without major 
      fluctuations, but the final accuracy rate is above 70%. CONCLUSION: The 
      prediction of BIS indicators by the deep learning method CNN algorithm shows good 
      results in statistics.

TI  - Machine learning approach to predicting persistent opioid use following lower 
      extremity joint arthroplasty.
PG  - 313-319
LID - 10.1136/rapm-2021-103299 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to develop predictive models for 
      persistent opioid use following lower extremity joint arthroplasty and determine 
      if ensemble learning and an oversampling technique may improve model performance. 
      METHODS: We compared various predictive models to identify at-risk patients for 
      persistent postoperative opioid use using various preoperative, intraoperative, 
      and postoperative data, including surgical procedure, patient 
      demographics/characteristics, past surgical history, opioid use history, 
      comorbidities, lifestyle habits, anesthesia details, and postoperative hospital 
      course. Six classification models were evaluated: logistic regression, random 
      forest classifier, simple-feedforward neural network, balanced random forest 
      classifier, balanced bagging classifier, and support vector classifier. 
      Performance with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was also 
      evaluated. Repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation was implemented to 
      calculate F1-scores and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve 
      (AUC). RESULTS: There were 1042 patients undergoing elective knee or hip 
      arthroplasty in which 242 (23.2%) reported persistent opioid use. Without SMOTE, 
      the logistic regression model has an F1 score of 0.47 and an AUC of 0.79. All 
      ensemble methods performed better, with the balanced bagging classifier having an 
      F1 score of 0.80 and an AUC of 0.94. SMOTE improved performance of all models 
      based on F1 score. Specifically, performance of the balanced bagging classifier 
      improved to an F1 score of 0.84 and an AUC of 0.96. The features with the highest 
      importance in the balanced bagging model were postoperative day 1 opioid use, 
      body mass index, age, preoperative opioid use, prescribed opioids at discharge, 
      and hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Ensemble learning can dramatically 
      improve predictive models for persistent opioid use. Accurate and early 
      identification of high-risk patients can play a role in clinical decision making 
      and early optimization with personalized interventions.

TI  - Considerations for the implementation of machine learning into acute care 
      settings.
PG  - 15-32
LID - 10.1093/bmb/ldac001 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Management of patients in the acute care setting requires accurate 
      diagnosis and rapid initiation of validated treatments; therefore, this setting 
      is likely to be an environment in which cognitive augmentation of the clinician's 
      provision of care with technology rooted in artificial intelligence, such as 
      machine learning (ML), is likely to eventuate. SOURCES OF DATA: PubMed and Google 
      Scholar with search terms that included ML, intensive/critical care unit, 
      electronic health records (EHR), anesthesia information management systems and 
      clinical decision support were the primary sources for this report. AREAS OF 
      AGREEMENT: Different categories of learning of large clinical datasets, often 
      contained in EHRs, are used for training in ML. Supervised learning uses 
      algorithm-based models, including support vector machines, to pair patients' 
      attributes with an expected outcome. Unsupervised learning uses clustering 
      algorithms to define to which disease grouping a patient's attributes most 
      closely approximates. Reinforcement learning algorithms use ongoing environmental 
      feedback to deterministically pursue likely patient outcome. AREAS OF 
      CONTROVERSY: Application of ML can result in undesirable outcomes over concerns 
      related to fairness, transparency, privacy and accountability. Whether these ML 
      technologies irrevocably change the healthcare workforce remains unresolved. 
      GROWING POINTS: Well-resourced Learning Health Systems are likely to exploit ML 
      technology to gain the fullest benefits for their patients. How these clinical 
      advantages can be extended to patients in health systems that are neither 
      well-endowed, nor have the necessary data gathering technologies, needs to be 
      urgently addressed to avoid further disparities in healthcare.

TI  - Ultrasound Image-Guided Nerve Block Combined with General Anesthesia under an 
      Artificial Intelligence Algorithm on Patients Undergoing Radical Gastrectomy for 
      Gastric Cancer during and after Operation.
PG  - 6914157
LID - 10.1155/2022/6914157 [doi]
LID - 6914157
AB  - This study was aimed at investigating the location of gastric cancer by using a 
      gastroscope image based on an artificial intelligence algorithm for gastric 
      cancer and the effect of ultrasonic-guided nerve block combined with general 
      anesthesia on patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery. A total of 160 patients 
      who were undergoing gastric cancer surgery from March 2019 to March 2021 were 
      collected as the research objects, and the convolutional neural network (CNN) 
      algorithm was used to segment the gastroscope image of gastric cancer. The 
      patients were randomly divided into a simple general anesthesia group of 80 cases 
      and a transversus abdominis plane block combined with rectus abdominis sheath 
      block combined with the general anesthesia group of 80 cases. Then, compare the 
      systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate 
      (HR) at the four time points T(0), T(1), T(2), and T(3). The times of analgesic 
      drug use within 48 hours after operation and postoperative adverse reactions were 
      recorded. The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were also recorded at 4 h, 12 h, 
      24 h, and 48 h. The results show that the image quality after segmentation is 
      good: the accuracy of tumor location is 75.67%, which is similar to that of 
      professional endoscopists. Compared with the general anesthesia group, the 
      transversus abdominis plane block combined with the rectus sheath block combined 
      with the general anesthesia group had fewer anesthetics, and the difference was 
      statistically significant (P < 0.05). Compared with the general anesthesia group, 
      SBP, DBP, and HR were significantly reduced at T(1), T(2), and T(3) in the 
      transverse abdominis plane block combined with rectus sheath block and general 
      anesthesia group (P < 0.05). Compared with the simple general anesthesia group, 
      the VAS scores of the transversus abdominis plane block combined with rectus 
      sheath block combined with the general anesthesia group decreased at 4 h, 12 h, 
      and 24 h after surgery, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 
      0.05). The number of analgesics used in transversus abdominis plane block 
      combined with the rectus sheath block combined with the general anesthesia group 
      within 48 hours after operation was significantly less than that in the general 
      anesthesia group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). 
      The average incidence of adverse reactions in the nerve block combined with the 
      general anesthesia group was 2.5%, which was lower than the average incidence of 
      3.75% in the general anesthesia group. In summary, the CNN algorithm can 
      accurately segment the lesions in the ultrasonic images of gastric cancer, which 
      was convenient for doctors to make a more accurate judgment on the lesions, and 
      provided a basis for the preoperative examination of radical gastrectomy for 
      gastric cancer. Ultrasonic-guided nerve block combined with general anesthesia 
      can effectively improve the analgesic effect of radical gastrectomy for gastric 
      cancer, reduced intraoperative and postoperative adverse reactions and analgesic 
      drug dosage, and had a good effect on postoperative recovery of patients. The 
      combined application of these two methods can further improve the precision 
      treatment of gastric cancer patients and accelerate postoperative recovery.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that the brain has an intrinsic resistance to 
      changes in arousal state. This resistance is most easily measured at the 
      population level in the setting of general anesthesia and has been termed neural 
      inertia. To date, no study has attempted to determine neural inertia in 
      individuals. We hypothesize that individuals with markedly increased or decreased 
      neural inertia might be at increased risk for complications related to state 
      transitions, from awareness under anesthesia, to delayed emergence or 
      confusion/impairment after emergence. Hence, an improved theoretical and 
      practical understanding of neural inertia may have the potential to identify 
      individuals at increased risk for these complications. This study was designed to 
      explicitly measure neural inertia in individuals and empirically test the 
      stochastic model of neural inertia using spectral analysis of the murine EEG. EEG 
      was measured after induction of and emergence from isoflurane administered near 
      the EC(50) dose for loss of righting in genetically inbred mice on a timescale 
      that minimizes pharmacokinetic confounds. Neural inertia was assessed by 
      employing classifiers constructed using linear discriminant or supervised machine 
      learning methods to determine if features of EEG spectra reliably demonstrate 
      path dependence at steady-state anesthesia. We also report the existence of 
      neural inertia at the individual level, as well as the population level, and that 
      neural inertia decreases over time, providing direct empirical evidence 
      supporting the predictions of the stochastic model of neural inertia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effects of combined 
      spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) with acupoint injection (AI) on the 
      maternal-fetal expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), 
      analgesia effect, and labor outcomes. METHODS: A total of 360 healthy primiparas 
      were randomized into the CSEA+AI group, the CSEA group, the AI group, and the 
      control group (n = 90, each group) according to the labor analgesia methods. 
      RESULTS: Compared to the CSEA group, the CSEA+AI group had significantly lower 
      visual analog scale (VAS) scores, adverse events, dose of ropivacaine/sufentanil, 
      and shorter labor durations. The IL-1β/IL-10 ratio in maternal peripheral blood 
      and umbilical cord blood was reduced in the CSEA+AI group compared with the CSEA 
      group. CONCLUSION: The combination of CSEA and AI can reduce the ratio of IL-1β/ 
      IL-10 in maternal peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood, which can 
      effectively relieve labor pain.

TI  - Exploring the utility of assistive artificial intelligence for ultrasound 
      scanning in regional anesthesia.
PG  - 375-379

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) involves the 
      acquisition and interpretation of ultrasound images to delineate sonoanatomy. 
      This study explores the utility of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) device 
      designed to assist in this task (ScanNav Anatomy Peripheral Nerve Block; 
      ScanNav), which applies a color overlay on real-time ultrasound to highlight key 
      anatomical structures. METHODS: Thirty anesthesiologists, 15 non-experts and 15 
      experts in UGRA, performed 240 ultrasound scans across nine peripheral nerve 
      block regions. Half were performed with ScanNav. After scanning each block 
      region, participants completed a questionnaire on the utility of the device in 
      relation to training, teaching, and clinical practice in ultrasound scanning for 
      UGRA. Ultrasound and color overlay output were recorded from scans performed with 
      ScanNav. Experts present during the scans (real-time experts) were asked to 
      assess potential for increased risk associated with use of the device (eg, needle 
      trauma to safety structures). This was compared with experts who viewed the AI 
      scans remotely. RESULTS: Non-experts were more likely to provide positive and 
      less likely to provide negative feedback than experts (p=0.001). Positive 
      feedback was provided most frequently by non-experts on the potential role for 
      training (37/60, 61.7%); for experts, it was for its utility in teaching (30/60, 
      50%). Real-time and remote experts reported a potentially increased risk in 
      12/254 (4.7%) vs 8/254 (3.1%, p=0.362) scans, respectively. DISCUSSION: ScanNav 
      shows potential to support non-experts in training and clinical practice, and 
      experts in teaching UGRA. Such technology may aid the uptake and generalizability 
      of UGRA. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04918693.

AB  - LITERATURE REVIEW: Cystoscopy is the gold standard for initial macroscopic 
      assessments of the human urinary bladder to rule out (or diagnose) bladder cancer 
      (BCa). Despite having guidelines, cystoscopic findings are diverse and often 
      challenging to classify. The extent of the false negatives and false positives in 
      cystoscopic diagnosis is currently unknown. We suspect that there is a certain 
      degree of under-diagnosis (like the failure to detect malignant tumours) and 
      over-diagnosis (e.g. sending the patient for unnecessary transurethral resection 
      of bladder tumors with anesthesia) that put the patient at risk. CONCLUSIONS: XAI 
      robot-assisted cystoscopes would help to overcome the risks/flaws of conventional 
      cystoscopy. Cystoscopy is considered a less life-threatening starting point for 
      automation than open surgical procedures. Semi-autonomous cystoscopy requires 
      standards and cystoscopy is a good procedure to establish a model that can then 
      be exported/copied to other procedures of endoscopy and surgery. Standards also 
      define the automation levels-an issue for medical product law. These cystoscopy 
      skills do not give full autonomy to the machine, and represent a surgical 
      parallel to 'Autonomous Driving' (where a standard requires a human supervisor to 
      remain in the 'vehicle'). Here in robotic cystoscopy, a human supervisor remains 
      bedside in the 'operating room' as a 'human-in-the-loop' in order to safeguard 
      patients. The urologists will be able to delegate personal- and time-consuming 
      cystoscopy to a specialised nurse. The result of automated diagnostic cystoscopy 
      is a short video (with pre-processed photos from the video), which are then 
      reviewed by the urologists at a more convenient time.

TI  - Machine learning methods for perioperative anesthetic management in cardiac 
      surgery patients: a scoping review.
PG  - 6976-6993
LID - 10.21037/jtd-21-765 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) is developing fast with promising prospects 
      within medicine and already has several applications in perioperative care. We 
      conducted a scoping review to examine the extent and potential limitations of ML 
      implementation in perioperative anesthetic care, specifically in cardiac surgery 
      patients. METHODS: We mapped the current literature by searching three databases: 
      MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and Cochrane Library. Articles were eligible if 
      they reported on perioperative ML use in the field of cardiac surgery with 
      relevance to anesthetic practices. Data on the applicability of ML and 
      comparability to conventional statistical methods were extracted. RESULTS: 
      Forty-six articles on ML relevant to the work of the anesthesiologist in cardiac 
      surgery were identified. Three main categories emerged: (I) event and risk 
      prediction, (II) hemodynamic monitoring, and (III) automation of 
      echocardiography. Prediction models based on ML tend to behave similarly to 
      conventional statistical methods. Using dynamic hemodynamic or ultrasound data in 
      ML models, however, shifts the potential to promising results. CONCLUSIONS: ML in 
      cardiac surgery is increasingly used in perioperative anesthetic management. The 
      majority is used for prediction purposes similar to conventional clinical scores. 
      Remarkable ML model performances are achieved when using real-time dynamic 
      parameters. However, beneficial clinical outcomes of ML integration have yet to 
      be determined. Nonetheless, the first steps introducing ML in perioperative 
      anesthetic care for cardiac surgery have been taken.

TI  - Multidisciplinary Tumor Board Smart Virtual Assistant in Locally Advanced 
      Cervical Cancer: A Proof of Concept.
PG  - 797454
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2021.797454 [doi]
LID - 797454
AB  - AIM: The first prototype of the "Multidisciplinary Tumor Board Smart Virtual 
      Assistant" is presented, aimed to (i) Automated classification of clinical stage 
      starting from different free-text diagnostic reports; (ii) Resolution of 
      inconsistencies by identifying controversial cases drawing the clinician's 
      attention to particular cases worthy for multi-disciplinary discussion; (iii) 
      Support environment for education and knowledge transfer to junior staff; (iv) 
      Integrated data-driven decision making and standardized language and 
      interpretation. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Data from patients affected by Locally 
      Advanced Cervical Cancer (LACC), FIGO stage IB2-IVa, treated between 2015 and 
      2018 were extracted. Magnetic Resonance (MR), Gynecologic examination under 
      general anesthesia (EAU), and Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography 
      (PET-CT) performed at the time of diagnosis were the items from the Electronic 
      Health Records (eHRs) considered for analysis. An automated extraction of eHR 
      that capture the patient's data before the diagnosis and then, through Natural 
      Language Processing (NLP), analysis and categorization of all data to transform 
      source information into structured data has been performed. RESULTS: In the first 
      round, the system has been used to retrieve all the eHR for the 96 patients with 
      LACC. The system has been able to classify all patients belonging to the training 
      set and - through the NLP procedures - the clinical features were analyzed and 
      classified for each patient. A second important result was the setup of a 
      predictive model to evaluate the patient's staging (accuracy of 94%). Lastly, we 
      created a user-oriented operational tool targeting the MTB who are confronted 
      with the challenge of large volumes of patients to be diagnosed in the most 
      accurate way. CONCLUSION: This is the first proof of concept concerning the 
      possibility of creating a smart virtual assistant for the MTB. A significant 
      benefit could come from the integration of these automated methods in the 
      collaborative, crucial decision stages.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk stratification plays a central role in anesthetic evaluation. 
      The use of Big Data and machine learning (ML) offers considerable advantages for 
      collection and evaluation of large amounts of complex health-care data. We 
      conducted a systematic review to understand the role of ML in the development of 
      predictive post-surgical outcome models and risk stratification. METHODS: 
      Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
      (PRISMA) guidelines, we selected the period of the research for studies from 1 
      January 2015 up to 30 March 2021. A systematic search in Scopus, CINAHL, the 
      Cochrane Library, PubMed, and MeSH databases was performed; the strings of 
      research included different combinations of keywords: "risk prediction," 
      "surgery," "machine learning," "intensive care unit (ICU)," and "anesthesia" 
      "perioperative." We identified 36 eligible studies. This study evaluates the 
      quality of reporting of prediction models using the Transparent Reporting of a 
      Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) 
      checklist. RESULTS: The most considered outcomes were mortality risk, systemic 
      complications (pulmonary, cardiovascular, acute kidney injury (AKI), etc.), ICU 
      admission, anesthesiologic risk and prolonged length of hospital stay. Not all 
      the study completely followed the TRIPOD checklist, but the quality was overall 
      acceptable with 75% of studies (Rev #2, comm #minor issue) showing an adherence 
      rate to TRIPOD more than 60%. The most frequently used algorithms were gradient 
      boosting (n = 13), random forest (n = 10), logistic regression (LR; n = 7), 
      artificial neural networks (ANNs; n = 6), and support vector machines (SVM; n = 
      6). Models with best performance were random forest and gradient boosting, with 
      AUC > 0.90. CONCLUSIONS: The application of ML in medicine appears to have a 
      great potential. From our analysis, depending on the input features considered 
      and on the specific prediction task, ML algorithms seem effective in outcomes 
      prediction more accurately than validated prognostic scores and traditional 
      statistics. Thus, our review encourages the healthcare domain and artificial 
      intelligence (AI) developers to adopt an interdisciplinary and systemic approach 
      to evaluate the overall impact of AI on perioperative risk assessment and on 
      further health care settings as well.

TI  - Machine learning algorithms predict extended postoperative opioid use in primary 
      total knee arthroplasty.
PG  - 2573-2581
LID - 10.1007/s00167-021-06812-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Adequate postoperative pain control following total knee arthroplasty 
      (TKA) is required to achieve optimal patient recovery. However, the postoperative 
      recovery may lead to an unnaturally extended opioid use, which has been 
      associated with adverse outcomes. This study hypothesizes that machine learning 
      models can accurately predict extended opioid use following primary TKA. METHODS: 
      A total of 8873 consecutive patients that underwent primary TKA were evaluated, 
      including 643 patients (7.2%) with extended postoperative opioid use (> 90 days). 
      Electronic patient records were manually reviewed to identify patient 
      demographics and surgical variables associated with prolonged postoperative 
      opioid use. Five machine learning algorithms were developed, encompassing the 
      breadth of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms available in the 
      literature, to predict extended opioid use following primary TKA, and these 
      models were assessed by discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis. 
      RESULTS: The strongest predictors for prolonged opioid prescription following 
      primary TKA were preoperative opioid duration (100% importance; p < 0.01), drug 
      abuse (54% importance; p < 0.01), and depression (47% importance; p < 0.01). The 
      five machine learning models all achieved excellent performance across 
      discrimination (AUC > 0.83), calibration, and decision curve analysis. Higher net 
      benefits for all machine learning models were demonstrated, when compared to the 
      default strategies of changing management for all patients or no patients. 
      CONCLUSION: The study findings show excellent model performance for the 
      prediction of extended postoperative opioid use following primary total knee 
      arthroplasty, highlighting the potential of these models to assist in 
      preoperatively identifying at risk patients, and allowing the implementation of 
      individualized peri-operative counselling and pain management strategies to 
      mitigate complications associated with prolonged opioid use. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patient-physician communication affects cancer patients' satisfaction, 
      health outcomes, and reimbursement for physician services. Our objective is to 
      use machine learning to comprehensively examine the association between patient 
      satisfaction and physician factors in clinical consultations about cancer 
      prognosis and pain. METHODS: We used data from audio-recorded, transcribed 
      communications between physicians and standardized patients (SPs). We analyzed 
      the data using logistic regression (LR) and random forests (RF). RESULTS: The LR 
      models suggested that lower patient satisfaction was associated with more 
      in-depth prognosis discussion; and higher patient satisfaction was associated 
      with a greater extent of shared decision making, patient being black, and doctor 
      being young. Conversely, the RF models suggested the opposite association with 
      the same set of variables. CONCLUSION: Somewhat contradicting results from 
      distinct machine learning models suggested possible confounding factors (hidden 
      variables) in prognosis discussion, shared decision-making, and doctor age, on 
      the modeling of patient satisfaction. Practitioners should not make inferences 
      with one single data-modeling method and enlarge the study cohort to help deal 
      with population heterogeneity. INNOVATION: Comparing diverse machine learning 
      models (both parametric and non-parametric types) and carefully applying variable 
      selection methods prior to regression modeling, can enrich the examination of 
      physician factors in characterizing patient-physician communication outcomes.

TI  - Postoperative delirium prediction using machine learning models and preoperative 
      electronic health record data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate, pragmatic risk stratification for postoperative delirium 
      (POD) is necessary to target preventative resources toward high-risk patients. 
      Machine learning (ML) offers a novel approach to leveraging electronic health 
      record (EHR) data for POD prediction. We sought to develop and internally 
      validate a ML-derived POD risk prediction model using preoperative risk features, 
      and to compare its performance to models developed with traditional logistic 
      regression. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of preoperative EHR data 
      from 24,885 adults undergoing a procedure requiring anesthesia care, recovering 
      in the main post-anesthesia care unit, and staying in the hospital at least 
      overnight between December 2016 and December 2019 at either of two hospitals in a 
      tertiary care health system. One hundred fifteen preoperative risk features 
      including demographics, comorbidities, nursing assessments, surgery type, and 
      other preoperative EHR data were used to predict postoperative delirium (POD), 
      defined as any instance of Nursing Delirium Screening Scale ≥2 or positive 
      Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit within the first 7 
      postoperative days. Two ML models (Neural Network and XGBoost), two traditional 
      logistic regression models ("clinician-guided" and "ML hybrid"), and a previously 
      described delirium risk stratification tool (AWOL-S) were evaluated using the 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and positive predictive value. Model 
      calibration was assessed with a calibration curve. Patients with no POD 
      assessments charted or at least 20% of input variables missing were excluded. 
      RESULTS: POD incidence was 5.3%. The AUC-ROC for Neural Net was 0.841 [95% CI 0. 
      816-0.863] and for XGBoost was 0.851 [95% CI 0.827-0.874], which was 
      significantly better than the clinician-guided (AUC-ROC 0.763 [0.734-0.793], 
      p < 0.001) and ML hybrid (AUC-ROC 0.824 [0.800-0.849], p < 0.001) regression 
      models and AWOL-S (AUC-ROC 0.762 [95% CI 0.713-0.812], p < 0.001). Neural Net, 
      XGBoost, and ML hybrid models demonstrated excellent calibration, while 
      calibration of the clinician-guided and AWOL-S models was moderate; they tended 
      to overestimate delirium risk in those already at highest risk. CONCLUSION: Using 
      pragmatically collected EHR data, two ML models predicted POD in a broad 
      perioperative population with high discrimination. Optimal application of the 
      models would provide automated, real-time delirium risk stratification to improve 
      perioperative management of surgical patients at risk for POD.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Predicts Cost After Ambulatory Anterior Cruciate Ligament 
      Reconstruction.
PG  - e2033-e2045
LID - 10.1016/j.asmr.2021.10.013 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and internally validate a machine-learning algorithm to 
      reliably predict cost after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). 
      METHODS: A retrospective review of the New York State Ambulatory Surgery and 
      Services database was performed to identify patients who underwent elective ACLR 
      from 2015 to 2016. Features included in initial models consisted of patient 
      characteristics (age, sex, insurance status, income, medical comorbidities as 
      classified by the Clinical Classifications Software diagnosis code) as well as 
      intraoperative variables (type of anesthesia and procedure-specific factors). 
      Models were generated to predict total charges using 4 algorithms: random forest, 
      extreme gradient boost, elastic net penalized regression, and support vector 
      machines with radial kernels. Training was performed with 10-fold 
      cross-validation followed by internal validation via 0.632 bootstrapping. Model 
      discriminative performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve, calibration, and the Brier score. Decision curve analysis 
      was performed to demonstrate the net benefit of using the final model in 
      practice. RESULTS: In total, 7,311 patients undergoing ambulatory ACLR were 
      included. The random forest model demonstrated the best performance assessed via 
      internal validation (area under the curve = 0.85), calibration, and the Brier 
      score (0.208). Cost incurred was influenced by anesthesia type, operating room 
      time, and number of chronic comorbidities. Decision curve analysis revealed a net 
      benefit for use of the random forest model and the model was integrated into a 
      web-based open-access application. CONCLUSIONS: The random forest model predicted 
      cost after ambulatory ACLR using a large, statewide database with good 
      performance. The top variables found to predict increased charges were general 
      anesthesia, operating room time, meniscal repair, self-pay insurance, patient 
      neighborhood characteristics, and number of chronic conditions. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: III, retrospective cohort study.

TI  - Machine Learning Model Identifies Increased Operative Time and Greater BMI as 
      Predictors for Overnight Admission After Outpatient Hip Arthroscopy.
PG  - e1981-e1990
LID - 10.1016/j.asmr.2021.10.001 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to identify patient characteristics and 
      risk factors for overnight admission following outpatient hip arthroscopy and to 
      develop a machine learning algorithm that can effectively identify patients 
      requiring admission following elective hip arthroscopy. METHODS: A retrospective 
      review of a prospectively collected national surgical outcomes database was 
      performed to identify patients who underwent elective outpatient hip arthroscopy 
      from 2006 to 2018. Patients admitted overnight postoperatively were identified as 
      those with length of stay of 1 or more days. Models were generated using random 
      forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), 
      elastic net penalized logistic regression, and an additional model was produced 
      as a weighted ensemble of the four final algorithms. RESULTS: Overall, 1,276 
      patients were included. The median age was 43 years, and 64.2% (819) were female. 
      Of the included patients, 109 (8.5%) required an overnight stay following 
      elective outpatient hip arthroscopy. The most important factors for inpatient 
      admission were increasing operative time, general anesthesia, age extremes, male 
      gender, greater body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists 
      classification >1, and the following preoperative lab values outside of normal 
      ranges: sodium, platelet count, hematocrit, and leukocyte count. The ensemble 
      model achieved the best performance based on discrimination assessed via internal 
      validation (area under the curve = .71), calibration, and decision curve 
      analysis. The model was integrated into a Web-based open-access application able 
      to provide both personalized predictions and explanations. CONCLUSION: A machine 
      learning algorithm developed based on preoperative features identified increasing 
      operative time, age extremes, greater BMI, sodium, hematocrit, platelets, and 
      leukocyte count as the most important variables associated with inpatient 
      admission with fair validity.

AB  - The first step to exercise is preceded by the required assumption of the upright 
      body position, which itself involves physical activity. The gravitational 
      displacement of blood from the chest to the lower parts of the body elicits a 
      fall in central blood volume (CBV), which corresponds to the fraction of thoracic 
      blood volume directly available to the left ventricle. The reduction in CBV and 
      stroke volume (SV) in response to postural stress, post-exercise, or to blood 
      loss results in reduced left ventricular filling, which may manifest as 
      orthostatic intolerance. When termination of exercise removes the leg muscle pump 
      function, CBV is no longer maintained. The resulting imbalance between a reduced 
      cardiac output (CO) and a still enhanced peripheral vascular conductance may 
      provoke post-exercise hypotension (PEH). Instruments that quantify CBV are not 
      readily available and to express which magnitude of the CBV in a healthy subject 
      should remains difficult. In the physiological laboratory, the CBV can be 
      modified by making use of postural stressors, such as lower body "negative" or 
      sub-atmospheric pressure (LBNP) or passive head-up tilt (HUT), while quantifying 
      relevant biomedical parameters of blood flow and oxygenation. Several approaches, 
      such as wearable sensors and advanced machine-learning techniques, have been 
      followed in an attempt to improve methodologies for better prediction of outcomes 
      and to guide treatment in civil patients and on the battlefield. In the recent 
      decade, efforts have been made to develop algorithms and apply artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in the field of hemodynamic monitoring. Advances in quantifying 
      and monitoring CBV during environmental stress from exercise to hemorrhage and 
      understanding the analogy between postural stress and central hypovolemia during 
      anesthesia offer great relevance for healthy subjects and clinical populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spontaneous breathing (SB) effort during mechanical ventilation (MV) 
      is an important metric of respiratory drive. However, SB effort varies due to a 
      variety of factors, including evolving pathology and sedation levels. Therefore, 
      assessment of SB efforts needs to be continuous and non-invasive. This is 
      important to prevent both over- and under-assistance with MV. In this study, a 
      machine learning model, Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is developed to quantify 
      the magnitude of SB effort using only bedside MV airway pressure and flow 
      waveform. METHOD: The CAE model was trained using 12,170,655 simulated SB flow 
      and normal flow data (NB). The paired SB and NB flow data were simulated using a 
      Gaussian Effort Model (GEM) with 5 basis functions. When the CAE model is given a 
      SB flow input, it is capable of predicting a corresponding NB flow for the SB 
      flow input. The magnitude of SB effort (SBE(Mag)) is then quantified as the 
      difference between the SB and NB flows. The CAE model was used to evaluate the 
      SBE(Mag) of 9 pressure control/ support datasets. Results were validated using a 
      mean squared error (MSE) fitting between clinical and training SB flows. RESULTS: 
      The CAE model was able to produce NB flows from the clinical SB flows with the 
      median SBE(Mag) of the 9 datasets being 25.39% [IQR: 21.87-25.57%]. The absolute 
      error in SBE(Mag) using MSE validation yields a median of 4.77% [IQR: 3.77-8.56%] 
      amongst the cohort. This shows the ability of the GEM to capture the intrinsic 
      details present in SB flow waveforms. Analysis also shows both intra-patient and 
      inter-patient variability in SBE(Mag). CONCLUSION: A Convolutional Autoencoder 
      model was developed with simulated SB and NB flow data and is capable of 
      quantifying the magnitude of patient spontaneous breathing effort. This provides 
      potential application for real-time monitoring of patient respiratory drive for 
      better management of patient-ventilator interaction.

AB  - The pandemic of the new coronavirus infection has swept the world and killed more 
      than 5 million people, which has shocked all human beings who have believed in 
      modern medical progress. Along with the sedation of infections, the balance 
      between restriction and acceleration of socio-economic activities is difficult. 
      With the spread of vaccines and the advent of viral therapeutic agents, we expect 
      how to control this pandemic has finally become visible. In this situation, we 
      realize that data science and robotics innovations are quite important in many 
      medical fields. Artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis and remote medical care 
      are becoming a reality, and this direction will accelerate further in 2022, the 
      first year of post-pandemic. The trend of digital transformation (Dx) will also 
      be rushing into Orthopedics next year. In addition, research on virtual reality 
      and augmented reality is being actively conducted, and it has become possible to 
      use it for surgical simulation and technical training. As, in the field of 
      abdominal surgery, remote robotic surgery will soon become available in the field 
      of orthopedics as well. These Dx trend will prevail to our field instead of 
      experience, and knowledge of medicine, which can change the medical care style 
      dramatically in near future. It is crucial for orthopedic surgeons to always aim 
      for its development and evolution.

TI  - Duration of Care and Operative Time Are the Primary Drivers of Total Charges 
      After Ambulatory Hip Arthroscopy: A Machine Learning Analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a machine learning algorithm to predict total charges after 
      ambulatory hip arthroscopy and create a risk-adjusted payment model based on 
      patient comorbidities. METHODS: A retrospective review of the New York State 
      Ambulatory Surgery and Services database was performed to identify patients who 
      underwent elective hip arthroscopy between 2015 and 2016. Features included in 
      initial models consisted of patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, and 
      procedure-specific variables. Models were generated to predict total charges 
      using 5 algorithms. Model performance was assessed by the root-mean-square error, 
      root-mean-square logarithmic error, and coefficient of determination. Global 
      variable importance and partial dependence curves were constructed to show the 
      impact of each input feature on total charges. For performance benchmarking, the 
      best candidate model was compared with a multivariate linear regression using the 
      same input features. RESULTS: A total of 5,121 patients were included. The median 
      cost after hip arthroscopy was $19,720 (interquartile range, $12,399-$26,439). 
      The gradient-boosted ensemble model showed the best performance (root-mean-square 
      error, $3,800 [95% confidence interval, $3,700-$3,900]; logarithmic 
      root-mean-square error, 0.249 [95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.26]; R(2) = 0.73). 
      Major cost drivers included total hours in facility less than 12 or more than 15, 
      longer procedure time, performance of a labral repair, age younger than 30 years, 
      Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) of 1 or greater, African American race, 
      residence in extreme urban and rural areas, and higher household and neighborhood 
      income. CONCLUSIONS: The gradient-boosted ensemble model effectively predicted 
      total charges after hip arthroscopy. Few modifiable variables were identified 
      other than anesthesia type; nonmodifiable drivers of total charges included 
      duration of care less than 12 hours or more than 15 hours, operating room time 
      more than 100 minutes, age younger than 30 years, performance of a labral repair, 
      and ECI greater than 0. Stratification of patients based on the ECI highlighted 
      the increased financial risk borne by physicians via flat reimbursement schedules 
      given variable degrees of comorbidities. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, 
      retrospective cohort study.

TI  - Electroencephalogram Signatures of Agitation Induced by Sevoflurane and Its 
      Association With Genetic Polymorphisms.
PG  - 678185

AB  - Background: Volatile anesthetic-induced agitation, also called paradoxical 
      excitation, is not uncommon during anesthesia induction. Clinically, patients 
      with agitation may lead to self-injury or disrupt the operative position, 
      increasing the incidence of perioperative adverse events. The study was designed 
      to investigate clinical features of sevoflurane-induced agitation and examined 
      whether any gene polymorphisms can potentially be used to predict agitation. 
      Methods: One hundred seventy-six patients underwent anesthesia induction with 
      sevoflurane were included in this study. Frontal electroencephalogram (EEG), 
      electromyography (EMG), and hemodynamics were recorded continuously during 
      anesthesia induction. DNA samples were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium 
      Asian Screening Array and the SNaPshot technology. Genetic association was 
      analyzed by genome-wide association study. Logistic regression analysis was used 
      to determine the role of variables in the prediction of agitation. Results: 
      Twenty-five (14.2%) patients experienced agitation. The depth of anesthesia index 
      (Ai index) (p < 0.001), EMG (p < 0.001), heart rate (HR) (p < 0.001), and mean 
      arterial pressure (MAP) (p < 0.001) rapidly increased during the agitation. EEG 
      exhibited a shift toward high frequencies with spikes during agitation. The fast 
      waves (alpha and beta) were more pronounced and the slow rhythms (delta) were 
      less prominent during the occurrence of agitation. Moreover, three SNPs in the 
      methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) gene were correlated to the susceptibility 
      to agitation (p < 5.0 × 10(-6)). Carrying rs1801394 A > G (odds ratio 3.50, 95% 
      CI 1.43-9.45) and/or rs2307116 G > A (3.31, 1.36-8.95) predicted a higher risk of 
      agitation. Discussion: This study suggests that the agitation/paradoxical 
      excitation induced by sevoflurane is characterized as increases in Ai index, EMG, 
      HR and MAP, and the high frequency with spikes in EEG. Moreover, our results 
      provide preliminary evidence for MTRR genetic polymorphisms, involving folate 
      metabolism function, may be related to the susceptibility to agitation. Clinical

AB  - Objective: To develop a prototype artificial intelligence image recognition 
      system for detecting dental caries, especially those without cavities, in 
      children. Methods: Seven hundred and twelve intraoral photos, which were taken by 
      dental professionals using a digital camera from October 2013 to June 2020 in the 
      Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of 
      Stomatology, were collected from the children who received dental treatment under 
      general anesthesia. The well-documented post-treatment electronic dental record 
      of each child was identified as label standard to determine whether the teeth 
      were carious and the type of caries types such as caries that had become cavities 
      (caries with cavities), pit and fissure caries that had not become cavities (pit 
      and fissure caries) and proximal caries which the marginal ridge enamel had not 
      been destroyed (proximal caries). The various teeth and caries types were labeled 
      by pediatric dentists using VoTT software (Windows 2.1.0, Microsoft, U S A). 
      There were five labeled groups: pit and fissure caries, approximal caries, 
      non-carious approximal surfaces, caries with cavities and teeth without caries 
      (including intact fillings). Each group was randomly divided into training 
      dataset, validation dataset and test dataset at a ratio of 6.4∶1.6∶2.0 by using 
      random number table. After using the labeled training dataset for deep learning 
      training, a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) image recognition 
      system for detecting dental caries was established, with the caries probability 
      greater than 50.0% as the criterion for determining caries. Sensitivity and 
      accuracy were used as indicators of recognition specificity. Results: Seven 
      hundred and twelve single-jaw intraoral photographs were segmented and annotated 
      into 953 pit and fissure caries, 1 002 approximal caries, 3 008 caries with 
      cavities, 3 189 teeth without caries and 862 non-carious approximal surfaces, 
      totaly 9 014 labels. The sensitivities and specificities of the test set were 
      96.0% and 97.0% for caries with cavities, 95.8% and 99.0% for pit and fissure 
      caries and 88.1% and 97.1% for approximal caries. Conclusions: The current AI 
      system developed based on deep learning of the intra-oral photos in the present 
      study showed the ability to detect dental caries. Furthermore, the AI system 
      could accurately verify different types of dental caries such as caries with 
      cavities, pit and fissure caries and proximal caries.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sentiment analysis, by evaluating written wording and its context, 
      is a growing tool used in computer science that can determine the level of 
      support expressed in a body of text using artificial intelligence methodologies. 
      The application of sentiment analysis to biomedical literature is a growing field 
      and offers the potential to rapidly and economically explore large amounts of 
      published research and characterize treatment efficacy. METHODS: We compared the 
      results of sentiment analysis of 115 article abstracts analyzed in a recently 
      published meta-analysis of peripheral nerve block usage in primary hip and knee 
      arthroplasty to the conclusions drawn by the authors of the original 
      meta-analysis. RESULTS: A moderately positive outlook supporting the utilization 
      of regional anesthesia for hip and knee arthroplasty was found in the 115 
      articles that were included for analysis, with 46% expressing positive sentiment, 
      35% expressing neutral sentiment, and 19% of abstracts expressing negative 
      sentiment. This was well aligned with the conclusions reached by a previous 
      meta-analysis of the same articles. DISCUSSION: Sentiment analysis applied to the 
      medical literature can rapidly evaluate large collections of published data and 
      generate an impression of overall findings that are aligned with the findings of 
      a traditional meta-analysis.

AB  - Recently, research has been conducted to automatically control anesthesia using 
      machine learning, with the aim of alleviating the shortage of anesthesiologists. 
      In this study, we address the problem of predicting decisions made by 
      anesthesiologists during surgery using machine learning; specifically, we 
      formulate a decision making problem by increasing the flow rate at each time 
      point in the continuous administration of analgesic remifentanil as a supervised 
      binary classification problem. The experiments were conducted to evaluate the 
      prediction performance using six machine learning models: logistic regression, 
      support vector machine, random forest, LightGBM, artificial neural network, and 
      long short-term memory (LSTM), using 210 case data collected during actual 
      surgeries. The results demonstrated that when predicting the future increase in 
      flow rate of remifentanil after 1 min, the model using LSTM was able to predict 
      with scores of 0.659 for sensitivity, 0.732 for specificity, and 0.753 for 
      ROC-AUC; this demonstrates the potential to predict the decisions made by 
      anesthesiologists using machine learning. Furthermore, we examined the importance 
      and contribution of the features of each model using Shapley additive 
      explanations-a method for interpreting predictions made by machine learning 
      models. The trends indicated by the results were partially consistent with known 
      clinical findings.

AB  - Background: Antipsychotic medications are the first-line treatment for 
      schizophrenia. However, non-adherence is frequent despite its negative impact on 
      the course of the illness. In response, we aimed to investigate social media 
      posts about antipsychotics to better understand the online environment in this 
      regard. Methods: We collected tweets containing mentions of antipsychotic 
      medications posted between January 1st 2019 and October 31st 2020. The content of 
      each tweet and the characteristics of the users were analyzed as well as the 
      number of retweets and likes generated. Results: Twitter users, especially those 
      identified as patients, showed an interest in antipsychotic medications, mainly 
      focusing on the topics of sexual dysfunction and sedation. Interestingly, 
      paliperidone, despite being among one of the newest antipsychotics, accounted for 
      a low number of tweets and did not generate much interest. Conversely, retweet 
      and like ratios were higher in those tweets asking for or offering help, in those 
      posted by institutions and in those mentioning cognitive complaints. Moreover, 
      health professionals did not have a strong presence in tweet postings, nor did 
      medical institutions. Finally, trivialization was frequently observed. 
      Conclusion: This analysis of tweets about antipsychotic medications provides 
      insights into experiences and opinions related to this treatment. Twitter user 
      perspectives therefore constitute a valuable input that may help to improve 
      clinicians' knowledge of antipsychotic medications and their communication with 
      patients regarding this treatment.

TI  - COVID-19 implications for pediatric anesthesia: Lessons learnt and how to prepare 
      for the next pandemic.
PG  - 385-390
LID - 10.1111/pan.14347 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 is mainly considered an "adult pandemic," but it also has strong 
      implications for children and consequently for pediatric anesthesia. Despite the 
      lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection being directly correlated with age, children 
      have equally experienced the negative impacts of this pandemic. In fact, the 
      spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms among children ranges from very mild to those 
      resembling adults, but may also present as a multisystemic inflammatory syndrome. 
      Moreover, the vast majority of children might be affected by asymptomatic or 
      pauci-symptomatic infection making them the "perfect" carriers for spreading the 
      disease in the community. Beyond the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, the COVID-19 pandemic may ultimately have catastrophic health and 
      socioeconomic consequences for children and adolescents, which are yet to be 
      defined. The aim of this narrative review is to highlight how COVID-19 pandemic 
      has affected and changed the pediatric anesthesia practice and which lessons are 
      to be learned in case of a future "pandemic." In particular, the rapid evolution 
      and dissemination of research and clinical findings have forced the scientific 
      community to adapt and alter clinical practice on an unseen and pragmatic manner. 
      Equally, implementation of new platforms, techniques, and devices together with 
      artificial intelligence and large-scale collaborative efforts may present a giant 
      step for mankind. The valuable lessons of this pandemic will ultimately translate 
      into new treatments modalities for various diseases but will also have the 
      potential for safety improvement and better quality of care. However, this 
      pandemic has revealed the vulnerability and deficiencies of our health-care 
      system. If not addressed properly, we may end up with a tsunami of burnout and 
      compassionate fatigue among health-care professionals. Pediatric anesthesia and 
      critical care staff are no exceptions.

TI  - Opal: an implementation science tool for machine learning clinical decision 
      support in anesthesia.
PG  - 1367-1377
LID - 10.1007/s10877-021-00774-1 [doi]
AB  - Opal is the first published example of a full-stack platform infrastructure for 
      an implementation science designed for ML in anesthesia that solves the problem 
      of leveraging ML for clinical decision support. Users interact with a secure 
      online Opal web application to select a desired operating room (OR) case cohort 
      for data extraction, visualize datasets with built-in graphing techniques, and 
      run in-client ML or extract data for external use. Opal was used to obtain data 
      from 29,004 unique OR cases from a single academic institution for pre-operative 
      prediction of post-operative acute kidney injury (AKI) based on creatinine KDIGO 
      criteria using predictors which included pre-operative demographic, past medical 
      history, medications, and flowsheet information. To demonstrate utility with 
      unsupervised learning, Opal was also used to extract intra-operative flowsheet 
      data from 2995 unique OR cases and patients were clustered using PCA analysis and 
      k-means clustering. A gradient boosting machine model was developed using an 
      80/20 train to test ratio and yielded an area under the receiver operating curve 
      (ROC-AUC) of 0.85 with 95% CI [0.80-0.90]. At the default probability decision 
      threshold of 0.5, the model sensitivity was 0.9 and the specificity was 0.8. 
      K-means clustering was performed to partition the cases into two clusters and for 
      hypothesis generation of potential groups of outcomes related to intraoperative 
      vitals. Opal's design has created streamlined ML functionality for researchers 
      and clinicians in the perioperative setting and opens the door for many future 
      clinical applications, including data mining, clinical simulation, high-frequency 
      prediction, and quality improvement.

TI  - Random Fourier Features-Based Deep Learning Improvement with Class Activation 
      Interpretability for Nerve Structure Segmentation.
LID - 10.3390/s21227741 [doi]
LID - 7741
AB  - Peripheral nerve blocking (PNB) is a standard procedure to support regional 
      anesthesia. Still, correct localization of the nerve's structure is needed to 
      avoid adverse effects; thereby, ultrasound images are used as an aid approach. In 
      addition, image-based automatic nerve segmentation from deep learning methods has 
      been proposed to mitigate attenuation and speckle noise ultrasonography issues. 
      Notwithstanding, complex architectures highlight the region of interest lacking 
      suitable data interpretability concerning the learned features from raw 
      instances. Here, a kernel-based deep learning enhancement is introduced for nerve 
      structure segmentation. In a nutshell, a random Fourier features-based approach 
      was utilized to complement three well-known semantic segmentation architectures, 
      e.g., fully convolutional network, U-net, and ResUnet. Moreover, two ultrasound 
      image datasets for PNB were tested. Obtained results show that our kernel-based 
      approach provides a better generalization capability from image 
      segmentation-based assessments on different nerve structures. Further, for data 
      interpretability, a semantic segmentation extension of the GradCam++ for 
      class-activation mapping was used to reveal relevant learned features separating 
      between nerve and background. Thus, our proposal favors both straightforward 
      (shallow) and complex architectures (deeper neural networks).

TI  - Automated sleep state classification of wide-field calcium imaging data via 
      multiplex visibility graphs and deep learning.
PG  - 109421
LID - S0165-0270(21)00356-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2021.109421 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) allows for monitoring of 
      cortex-wide neural dynamics in mice. When applied to the study of sleep, WFCI 
      data are manually scored into the sleep states of wakefulness, non-REM (NREM) and 
      REM by use of adjunct EEG and EMG recordings. However, this process is 
      time-consuming and often suffers from low inter- and intra-rater reliability and 
      invasiveness. Therefore, an automated sleep state classification method that 
      operates on WFCI data alone is needed. NEW METHOD: A hybrid, two-step method is 
      proposed. In the first step, spatial-temporal WFCI data is mapped to multiplex 
      visibility graphs (MVGs). Subsequently, a two-dimensional convolutional neural 
      network (2D CNN) is employed on the MVGs to be classified as wakefulness, NREM 
      and REM. RESULTS: Sleep states were classified with an accuracy of 84% and 
      Cohen's κ of 0.67. The method was also effectively applied on a binary 
      classification of wakefulness/sleep (accuracy=0.82, κ = 0.62) and a four-class 
      wakefulness/sleep/anesthesia/movement classification (accuracy=0.74, κ = 0.66). 
      Gradient-weighted class activation maps revealed that the CNN focused on short- 
      and long-term temporal connections of MVGs in a sleep state-specific manner. 
      Sleep state classification performance when using individual brain regions was 
      highest for the posterior area of the cortex and when cortex-wide activity was 
      considered. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: On a 3-hour WFCI recording, the 
      MVG-CNN achieved a κ of 0.65, comparable to a κ of 0.60 corresponding to the 
      human EEG/EMG-based scoring. CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid MVG-CNN method accurately 
      classifies sleep states from WFCI data and will enable future sleep-focused 
      studies with WFCI.

TI  - Predictive Clinical Decision Support System Using Machine Learning and Imaging 
      Biomarkers in Patients With Neurostimulation Therapy: A Pilot Study.
PG  - E1279-E1290
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is correlated with alterations in brain structure and 
      function. The selection process for the ideal candidate for spinal cord 
      stimulation (SCS) therapy is based on functional variables analysis and pain 
      evaluation scores. In addition to the difficulties involved in the initial 
      selection of patients and the predictive analysis of the trial phase, the large 
      rate of explants is one of the most important concerns in the analysis of the 
      suitability of implanted candidates. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the usefulness of 
      imaging biomarkers, functional connectivity (FC) and volumetry of the whole brain 
      in patients with Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) and to create a clinical 
      patient-based decision support system (CDSS) combining neuroimaging and clinical 
      data for predicting the effectiveness of neurostimulation therapy after a trial 
      phase. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, consecutive, observational, single center 
      study. SETTING: The Multidisciplinary Pain Management Department of the General 
      University Hospital in Valencia, Spain. METHODS: A prospective, consecutive, and 
      observational single-center study. Using Resting-state functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and Region of interest (ROI) to ROI analysis, we 
      compared the functional connectivity between regions to detect differences in FC 
      and volume changes. Basal magnetic resonance images were obtained in a 1.5T 
      system and clinical variables were collected twice, at the basal condition and at 
      6-months post-SCS implant. We also conducted a seed-to-voxel analysis with 9 
      items as seed-areas characterizing the functional connectivity networks. A 
      decreased in 10 units in the Pain Detect Questionnaire (PD-Q) score was 
      established to define the subgroup of Responders Group (R-G) to neurostimulation 
      therapy. The clinical variables collected and the imaging biomarkers obtained (FC 
      and volumes) were tested on a set of 6 machine learning approaches in an effort 
      to find the best classifier system for predicting the effectiveness of the 
      neurostimulator. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were analyzed and only seven were 
      classified in the R-G. Volumetric differences were found in the left putamen, F = 
      34.06, P = 0.02. Four pairwise brain areas showed statistical differences in the 
      rs-fMRI including the right insular cortex. Linear Discriminant Analysis showed 
      the best performance for building the CDSS combining clinical variables and 
      significant imaging biomarkers, the prediction increased diagnostic accuracy in 
      the R-G patients from 29% in current practice to 96% of long-term success. 
      CONCLUSION: These findings confirm a major role of the left putamen and the four 
      pairs of brain regions in FBBS patients and suggest that a CDSS would be able to 
      select patients susceptible to benefitting from SCS therapy adding imaging 
      biomarkers.

TI  - Automated machine learning-based model predicts postoperative delirium using 
      readily extractable perioperative collected electronic data.
PG  - 608-618
LID - 10.1111/cns.13758 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common postoperative complication 
      that is relevant to poor outcomes. Therefore, it is critical to find effective 
      methods to identify patients with high risk of POD rapidly. Creating a fully 
      automated score based on an automated machine-learning algorithm may be a method 
      to predict the incidence of POD quickly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is the 
      secondary analysis of an observational study, including 531 surgical patients who 
      underwent general anesthesia. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
      (LASSO) was used to screen essential features associated with POD. Finally, eight 
      features (age, intraoperative blood loss, anesthesia duration, extubation time, 
      intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mini-mental state examination score [MMSE], 
      Charlson comorbidity index [CCI], postoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
      [NLR]) were used to established models. Four models, logistic regression, random 
      forest, extreme gradient boosted trees, and support vector machines, were built 
      in a training set (70% of participants) and evaluated in the remaining testing 
      sample (30% of participants). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used 
      to explore independent risk factors for POD further. RESULTS: Model 1 (logistic 
      regression model) was found to outperform other classifier models in testing data 
      (area under the curve [AUC] of 80.44%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      72.24%-88.64%) and achieve the lowest Brier Score as well. These variables 
      including age (OR = 1.054, 95%CI: 1.017~1.093), extubation time (OR = 1.027, 
      95%CI: 1.012~1.044), ICU admission (OR = 2.238, 95%CI: 1.313~3.793), MMSE 
      (OR = 0.929, 95%CI: 0.876~0.984), CCI (OR = 1.197, 95%CI: 1.038~1.384), and 
      postoperative NLR (OR = 1.029, 95%CI: 1.002~1.057) were independent risk factors 
      for POD in this study. CONCLUSIONS: We have built and validated a high-performing 
      algorithm to demonstrate the extent to which patient risk changes of POD during 
      the perioperative period, thus leading to a rational therapeutic choice.

BTI - Perioperative Care in Adults With HIV
AB  - This guideline was developed by the New York State Department of Health AIDS 
      Institute (NYSDOH AI) Clinical Guidelines Program to assist clinicians in 
      perioperative care management for adults with HIV, which is largely the same as 
      for adults without HIV. The guideline focuses on concerns specific to patients 
      with HIV. The goals of this guideline are to: Make clear that HIV is not a 
      contraindication to surgery. Advise that HIV does not increase surgical risk in 
      virally suppressed patients and that HIV transmission to the surgical team is 
      eliminated in virally suppressed patients. Provide guidance for managing risks of 
      elective surgery in patients who are not virally suppressed. Emphasize that 
      interruptions in antiretroviral therapy (ART) and opportunistic infection (OI) 
      prophylaxis or treatment should be avoided. The guideline is intended to 
      supplement, not replace, routinely used perioperative protocols that cover 
      stabilization of active medical conditions and risk stratification.

AB  - Stimulation and continuous monitoring of neural activities at cellular resolution 
      are required for the understanding of the sensory processing of stimuli and 
      development of effective neuromodulation therapies. We present bioluminescence 
      multi-characteristic opsin (bMCOII), a hybrid optogenetic actuator, and a 
      bioluminescence Ca(2+) sensor for excitation-free, continuous monitoring of 
      neural activities in the visual cortex, with high spatiotemporal resolution. An 
      exceptionally low intensity (10 μW/mm(2)) of light could elicit neural activation 
      that could be detected by Ca(2+) bioluminescence imaging. An uninterrupted (>14 
      h) recording of visually evoked neural activities in the cortex of mice enabled 
      the determination of strength of sensory activation. Furthermore, an artificial 
      intelligence-based neural activation parameter transformed Ca(2+) bioluminescence 
      signals to network activity patterns. During continuous Ca(2+)-bioluminescence 
      recordings, visual cortical activity peaked at the seventh to eighth hour of 
      anesthesia, coinciding with circadian rhythm. For both direct optogenetic 
      stimulation in cortical slices and visually evoked activities in the visual 
      cortex, we observed secondary delayed Ca(2+)-bioluminescence responses, 
      suggesting the involvement of neuron-astrocyte-neuron pathway. Our approach will 
      enable the development of a modular and scalable interface system capable of 
      serving a multiplicity of applications to modulate and monitor large-scale 
      activities in the brain.

TI  - Development of a random forest model for hypotension prediction after anesthesia 
      induction for cardiac surgery.
PG  - 8729-8739
LID - 10.12998/wjcc.v9.i29.8729 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypotension after the induction of anesthesia is known to be 
      associated with various adverse events. The involvement of a series of factors 
      makes the prediction of hypotension during anesthesia quite challenging. AIM: To 
      explore the ability and effectiveness of a random forest (RF) model in the 
      prediction of post-induction hypotension (PIH) in patients undergoing cardiac 
      surgery. METHODS: Patient information was obtained from the electronic health 
      records of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University. The study 
      included patients, ≥ 18 years of age, who underwent cardiac surgery from December 
      2007 to January 2018. An RF algorithm, which is a supervised machine learning 
      technique, was employed to predict PIH. Model performance was assessed by the 
      area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic. Mean 
      decrease in the Gini index was used to rank various features based on their 
      importance. RESULTS: Of the 3030 patients included in the study, 1578 (52.1%) 
      experienced hypotension after the induction of anesthesia. The RF model performed 
      effectively, with an AUC of 0.843 (0.808-0.877) and identified mean blood 
      pressure as the most important predictor of PIH after anesthesia. Age and body 
      mass index also had a significant impact. CONCLUSION: The generated RF model had 
      high discrimination ability for the identification of individuals at high risk 
      for a hypotensive event during cardiac surgery. The study results highlighted 
      that machine learning tools confer unique advantages for the prediction of 
      adverse post-anesthesia events.

TI  - Is P&T Ready to Add Rapid Cycle Analytics to Formulary?
PG  - 430-435
LID - 10.1177/0018578720918341 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: The intent of this article is to evaluate a novel approach, using rapid 
      cycle analytics and real world evidence, to optimize and improve the medication 
      evaluation process to help the formulary decision making process, while reducing 
      time for clinicians. Summary: The Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee 
      within each health system is responsible for evaluating medication requests for 
      formulary addition. Members of the pharmacy staff prepare the drug monograph or a 
      medication use evaluation (MUE) and allocate precious clinical resources to 
      review patient charts to assess efficacy and value. We explored a novel approach 
      to evaluate the value of our intravenous acetaminophen (IV APAP) formulary 
      admittance. This new methodology, called rapid cycle analytics, can assist 
      hospitals in meeting and/or exceeding the minimum criteria of formulary 
      maintenance as defined by the Joint Commission Standards. In this particular 
      study, we assessed the effectiveness of IV APAP in total hip arthroplasty (THA) 
      and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures. We assessed the correlation to 
      same-stay opioid utilization, average length of inpatient stay and post 
      anesthesia care unit (PACU) time. Conclusion: We were able to explore and improve 
      our organization's approach in evaluating medications by partnering with an 
      external analytics expert to help organize and normalize our data in a more 
      robust, yet time efficient manner. Additionally, we were able to use a 
      significantly larger external data set as a point of reference. Being able to 
      perform this detailed analytical exercise for thousands of encounters internally 
      and using a data warehouse of over 130 million patients as a point of reference 
      in a short time has improved the depth of our assessment, as well as reducing 
      valuable clinical resources allocated to MUEs to allow for more direct patient 
      care. This clinically real-world and data-rich analytics model is the necessary 
      foundation for using Artificial or Augmented Intelligence (AI) to make real-time 
      formulary and drug selection decisions.

TI  - A Novel Method for Colorectal Cancer Screening Based on Circulating Tumor Cells 
      and Machine Learning.
LID - 10.3390/e23101248 [doi]
LID - 1248
AB  - Colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and it can have a 
      high mortality rate if left untreated or undiagnosed. The fact that CRC becomes 
      symptomatic at advanced stages highlights the importance of early screening. The 
      reference screening method for CRC is colonoscopy, an invasive, time-consuming 
      procedure that requires sedation or anesthesia and is recommended from a certain 
      age and above. The aim of this study was to build a machine learning classifier 
      that can distinguish cancer from non-cancer samples. For this, circulating tumor 
      cells were enumerated using flow cytometry. Their numbers were used as a training 
      set for building an optimized SVM classifier that was subsequently used on a 
      blind set. The SVM classifier's accuracy on the blind samples was found to be 
      90.0%, sensitivity was 80.0%, specificity was 100.0%, precision was 100.0% and 
      AUC was 0.98. Finally, in order to test the generalizability of our method, we 
      also compared the performances of different classifiers developed by various 
      machine learning models, using over-sampling datasets generated by the SMOTE 
      algorithm. The results showed that SVM achieved the best performances according 
      to the validation accuracy metric. Overall, our results demonstrate that CTCs 
      enumerated by flow cytometry can provide significant information, which can be 
      used in machine learning algorithms to successfully discriminate between healthy 
      and colorectal cancer patients. The clinical significance of this method could be 
      the development of a simple, fast, non-invasive cancer screening tool based on 
      blood CTC enumeration by flow cytometry and machine learning algorithms.

TI  - A Simple Risk Scoring System for Predicting the Occurrence of Aspiration 
      Pneumonia After Gastric Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection.
PG  - 114-122
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000005779 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspiration pneumonia after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is 
      rare, but can be fatal. We aimed to investigate risk factors and develop a simple 
      risk scoring system for aspiration pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively 
      reviewed medical records of 7833 patients who underwent gastric ESD for gastric 
      neoplasm under anesthesiologist-directed sedation. Candidate risk factors were 
      screened and assessed for significance using a least absolute shrinkage and 
      selection operator (LASSO)-based method. Top significant factors were 
      incorporated into a multivariable logistic regression model, whose prediction 
      performance was compared with those of other machine learning models. The final 
      risk scoring system was created based on the estimated odds ratios of the 
      logistic regression model. RESULTS: The incidence of aspiration pneumonia was 
      1.5%. The logistic regression model showed comparable performance to the best 
      predictive model, extreme gradient boost (area under receiver operating 
      characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.731 vs 0.740). The estimated odds ratios were 
      subsequently used for the development of the clinical scoring system. The final 
      scoring system exhibited an AUROC of 0.730 in the test dataset with risk factors: 
      age (≥70 years, 4 points), male sex (8 points), body mass index (≥27 kg/m2, 4 
      points), procedure time (≥80 minutes, 5 points), lesion in the lower third of the 
      stomach (5 points), tumor size (≥10 mm, 3 points), recovery time (≥35 minutes, 4 
      points), and desaturation during ESD (9 points). For patients with total scores 
      ranging between 0 and 33 points, aspiration pneumonia probabilities spanned 
      between 0.1% and 17.9%. External validation using an additional cohort of 827 
      patients yielded AUROCs of 0.698 for the logistic regression model and 0.680 for 
      the scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Our simple risk scoring system has 8 predictors 
      incorporating patient-, procedure-, and sedation-related factors. This system may 
      help clinicians to stratify patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia after ESD.

AB  - Aim: To conduct a cost-utility analysis of a novel genetic diagnostic test 
      (OUDTEST) for risk of developing opioid use disorder for elective orthopedic 
      surgery patients. Materials & Methods: A simulation model assessed 
      cost-effectiveness and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for OUDTEST from 
      private insurer and self-insured employer perspectives over a 5-year time horizon 
      for a hypothetical patient population. Results: OUDTEST was found to cost less 
      and increase QALYs, over a 5-year period for private insurance (savings US$2510; 
      QALYs 0.02) and self-insured employers (-US$2682; QALYs 0.02). OUDTEST was a 
      dominant strategy in 71.1% (private insurance) and 72.7% (self-insured employer) 
      of model iterations. Sensitivity analyses revealed robust results except for 
      physician compliance. Conclusion: OUDTEST was expected to be a cost-effective 
      solution for personalizing postsurgical pain management in orthopedic patients.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      features based on deep learning super-resolution algorithms in evaluating the 
      value of propofol anesthesia for brain protection of patients undergoing 
      craniotomy evacuation of the hematoma. An optimized super-resolution algorithm 
      was obtained through the multiscale network reconstruction model based on the 
      traditional algorithm. A total of 100 patients undergoing craniotomy evacuation 
      of hematoma were recruited and rolled into sevoflurane control group and propofol 
      experimental group. Both were evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      images based on deep learning super-resolution algorithms. The results showed 
      that the fractional anisotropic image (FA) value of the hind limb corticospinal 
      tract of the affected side of the internal capsule of the experimental group 
      after the operation was 0.67 ± 0.28. The National Institute of Health Stroke 
      Scale (NIHSS) score was 6.14 ± 3.29. The oxygen saturation in jugular venous 
      (SjvO(2)) at T4 and T5 was 61.93 ± 6.58% and 59.38 ± 6.2%, respectively, and 
      cerebral oxygen uptake rate (CO(2)ER) was 31.12 ± 6.07% and 35.83 ± 7.91%, 
      respectively. The difference in jugular venous oxygen (Da-jvO(2)) at T3, T4, and 
      T5 was 63.28 ± 10.15 mL/dL, 64.89 ± 13.11 mL/dL, and 66.03 ± 11.78 mL/dL, 
      respectively. The neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and central-nerve-specific 
      protein (S100β) levels at T5 were 53.85 ± 12.31 ng/mL and 7.49 ± 3.16 ng/mL, 
      respectively. In terms of the number of postoperative complications, the patients 
      in the experimental group were better than the control group under sevoflurane 
      anesthesia, and the differences were substantial (P < 0.05). In conclusion, MRI 
      images based on deep learning super-resolution algorithm have great clinical 
      value in evaluating the degree of brain injury in patients anesthetized with 
      propofol and the protective effect of propofol on brain nerves.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrasonography for neuraxial anesthesia is increasingly being used 
      to identify spinal structures and the identification of correct point of needle 
      insertion to improve procedural success, in particular in obesity. We developed 
      an ultrasound-guided automated spinal landmark identification program to assist 
      anesthetists on spinal needle insertion point with a graphical user interface for 
      spinal anesthesia. METHODS: Forty-eight obese patients requiring spinal 
      anesthesia for Cesarean section were recruited in this prospective cohort study. 
      We utilized a developed machine learning algorithm to determine the needle 
      insertion point using automated spinal landmark ultrasound imaging of the lumbar 
      spine identifying the L3/4 interspinous space (longitudinal view) and the 
      posterior complex of dura mater (transverse view). The demographic and clinical 
      characteristics were also recorded. RESULTS: The first attempt success rate for 
      spinal anesthesia was 79.1% (38/48) (95%CI 65.0 - 89.5%), followed by successful 
      second attempt of 12.5% (6/48), third attempt of 4.2% (2/48) and 4th attempt 
      (4.2% or 2/48). The scanning duration of L3/4 interspinous space and the 
      posterior complex were 21.0 [IQR: 17.0, 32.0] secs and 11.0 [IQR: 5.0, 22.0] secs 
      respectively. There is good correlation between the program recorded depth of the 
      skin to posterior complex and clinician measured depth (r = 0.915). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The automated spinal landmark identification program is able to provide 
      assistance to needle insertion point identification in obese patients. There is 
      good correlation between program recorded and clinician measured depth of the 
      skin to posterior complex of dura mater. Future research may involve imaging 
      algorithm improvement to assist with needle insertion guidance during neuraxial 
      anesthesia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov 
      registry ( NCT03687411 ) on 22 Aug 2018.

AB  - In order to discuss the clinical characteristics of patients with scapular 
      fracture, deep learning model was adopted in ultrasound images of patients to 
      locate the anesthesia point of patients during scapular fracture surgery treated 
      with the regional nerve block. 100 patients with scapular fracture who were 
      hospitalized for emergency treatment in the hospital were recruited. Patients in 
      the algorithm group used ultrasound-guided regional nerve block puncture, and 
      patients in the control group used traditional body surface anatomy for 
      anesthesia positioning. The ultrasound images of the scapula of the contrast 
      group were used for the identification of the deep learning model and analysis of 
      anesthesia acupuncture sites. The ultrasound images of the scapula anatomy of the 
      patients in the contrast group were extracted, and the convolutional neural 
      network model was employed for training and test. Moreover, the model performance 
      was evaluated. It was found that the adoption of deep learning greatly improved 
      the accuracy of the image. It took an average of 7.5 ± 2.07 minutes from the time 
      the puncture needle touched the skin to the completion of the injection in the 
      algorithm group (treated with artificial intelligence ultrasound positioning). 
      The operation time of the control group (anatomical positioning) averaged 
      10.2 ± 2.62 min. Moreover, there was a significant difference between the two 
      groups (p < 0.05). The method adopted in the contrast group had high positioning 
      accuracy and good anesthesia effect, and the patients had reduced postoperative 
      complications of patients (all P < 0.005). The deep learning model can 
      effectively improve the accuracy of ultrasound images and measure and assist the 
      treatment of future clinical cases of scapular fractures. While improving medical 
      efficiency, it can also accurately identify patient fractures, which has great 
      adoption potential in improving the effect of surgical anesthesia.

      waveforms (ClearSight): clinical performance in Gynaecologic Oncologic Surgery.
PG  - 1325-1332
LID - 10.1007/s10877-021-00763-4 [doi]
AB  - Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is common during major surgery and is associated 
      with a poor postoperative outcome. Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) is an 
      algorithm derived from machine learning that uses the arterial waveform to 
      predict IOH. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic ability of HPI 
      working with non-invasive ClearSight system in predicting impending hypotension 
      in patients undergoing major gynaecologic oncologic surgery (GOS). In this 
      retrospective analysis hemodynamic data were downloaded from an Edwards 
      Lifesciences HemoSphere platform and analysed. Receiver operating characteristic 
      curves were constructed to evaluate the performance of HPI working on the 
      ClearSight pressure waveform in predicting hypotensive events, defined as mean 
      arterial pressure < 65 mmHg for > 1 min. Sensitivity, specificity, positive 
      predictive value and negative predictive value were computed at a cutpoint (the 
      value which minimizes the difference between sensitivity and specificity). 
      Thirty-one patients undergoing GOS were included in the analysis, 28 of which had 
      complete data set. The HPI predicted hypotensive events with a sensitivity of 
      0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.94] and specificity of 0.85 (95% CI 
      0.74-0.95) 15 min before the event [area under the curve (AUC) 0.95 (95% CI 
      0.89-0.99)]; with a sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.92) and specificity of 
      0.83 (95% CI 0.71-0.93) 10 min before the event [AUC 0.9 (95% CI 0.83-0.97)]; and 
      with a sensitivity of 0.86 (95% CI 0.78-0.93) and specificity 0.86 (95% CI 
      0.77-0.94) 5 min before the event [AUC 0.93 (95% CI 0.89-0.97)]. HPI provides 
      accurate and continuous prediction of impending IOH before its occurrence in 
      patients undergoing GOS in general anesthesia.

TI  - Predicting Prolonged Apnea During Nurse-Administered Procedural Sedation: Machine 
      Learning Study.
PG  - e29200
LID - 10.2196/29200 [doi]
LID - e29200
AB  - BACKGROUND: Capnography is commonly used for nurse-administered procedural 
      sedation. Distinguishing between capnography waveform abnormalities that signal 
      the need for clinical intervention for an event and those that do not indicate 
      the need for intervention is essential for the successful implementation of this 
      technology into practice. It is possible that capnography alarm management may be 
      improved by using machine learning to create a "smart alarm" that can alert 
      clinicians to apneic events that are predicted to be prolonged. OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine the accuracy of machine learning models for predicting at the 15-second 
      time point if apnea will be prolonged (ie, apnea that persists for >30 seconds). 
      METHODS: A secondary analysis of an observational study was conducted. We 
      selected several candidate models to evaluate, including a random forest model, 
      generalized linear model (logistic regression), least absolute shrinkage and 
      selection operator regression, ridge regression, and the XGBoost model. 
      Out-of-sample accuracy of the models was calculated using 10-fold 
      cross-validation. The net benefit decision analytic measure was used to assist 
      with deciding whether using the models in practice would lead to better outcomes 
      on average than using the current default capnography alarm management 
      strategies. The default strategies are the aggressive approach, in which an alarm 
      is triggered after brief periods of apnea (typically 15 seconds) and the 
      conservative approach, in which an alarm is triggered for only prolonged periods 
      of apnea (typically >30 seconds). RESULTS: A total of 384 apneic events longer 
      than 15 seconds were observed in 61 of the 102 patients (59.8%) who participated 
      in the observational study. Nearly half of the apneic events (180/384, 46.9%) 
      were prolonged. The random forest model performed the best in terms of 
      discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.66) and 
      calibration. The net benefit associated with the random forest model exceeded 
      that associated with the aggressive strategy but was lower than that associated 
      with the conservative strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Decision curve analysis indicated 
      that using a random forest model would lead to a better outcome for capnography 
      alarm management than using an aggressive strategy in which alarms are triggered 
      after 15 seconds of apnea. The model would not be superior to the conservative 
      strategy in which alarms are only triggered after 30 seconds.

AB  - PURPOSE: Physician review websites have significant influence on a patient's 
      selection of a provider, but written reviews are subjective. Sentiment analysis 
      of writing through artificial intelligence can quantify surgeon reviews to 
      provide actionable feedback. The objective of this study is to quantitatively 
      analyze the written reviews of members of the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) 
      through sentiment analysis. METHODS: Online written reviews and star-rating 
      reviews of SRS surgeons were obtained from healthgrades.com, and a sentiment 
      analysis package was used to obtain compound scores of each physician's reviews. 
      A t test and ANOVA was performed to determine the relationship between 
      demographic variables and average sentiment score of written reviews. Positive 
      and negative word and word-pair frequency analysis was performed to provide 
      context to words used to describe surgeons. RESULTS: Seven hundred and twenty-one 
      SRS surgeon's reviews were analyzed. Analysis showed a positive correlation 
      between the sentiment scores and overall average star-rated reviews (r(2) = 0.5, 
      p < 0.01). There was no difference in review sentiment by provider gender. 
      However, the age of surgeons showed a significant difference as younger surgeons, 
      on average, had more positive reviews (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The most frequently 
      used word pairs used to describe top-rated surgeons describe compassionate 
      providers and efficiency in pain management. Conversely, those with the worst 
      reviews are characterized as unable to relieve pain. Through quantitative 
      analysis of physician reviews, pain is a clear factor contributing to both 
      positive and negative reviews of surgeons, reinforcing the need to properly 
      manage pain expectations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pain is the unpleasant sensation and emotional experience that 
      leads to poor quality of life for millions of people worldwide. Considering the 
      complexity in understanding the principles of pain and its significant impact on 
      individuals and society, research focuses to deliver innovative pain relief 
      methods and techniques. This review explores the clinical uses of machine 
      learning (ML) for the diagnosis, classification, and management of pain. METHODS: 
      A systematic review of the current literature was conducted using the PubMed 
      database library. RESULTS: Twenty-six papers related to pain and ML research were 
      included. Most of the studies used ML for effectively classifying the patients' 
      level of pain, followed by use of ML for the prediction of manifestation of pain 
      and for pain management. A less common reason for performing ML analysis was for 
      the diagnosis of pain. The different approaches are thoroughly discussed. 
      CONCLUSION: ML is increasingly used in pain medicine and appears to be more 
      effective compared to traditional statistical approaches in the diagnosis, 
      classification, and management of pain.

AB  - Pain is a complex, multidimensional experience that emerges from interactions 
      among sensory, affective, and cognitive processes in the brain. Neuroimaging 
      allows us to identify these component processes and model how they combine to 
      instantiate the pain experience. However, the clinical impact of pain 
      neuroimaging models has been limited by inadequate population sampling - young 
      healthy college students are not representative of chronic pain patients. The 
      biopsychosocial approach to pain management situates a person's pain within the 
      diverse socioeconomic environments they live in. To increase the clinical 
      relevance of pain neuroimaging models, a three-fold biopsychosocial approach to 
      neuroimaging biomarker development is recommended. The first level calls for the 
      development of diagnostic biomarkers via the standard population-based 
      (nomothetic) approach with an emphasis on diverse sampling. The second level 
      calls for the development of treatment-relevant models via a constrained 
      person-based (idiographic) approach tailored to unique individuals. The third 
      level calls for the development of prevention-relevant models via a novel 
      society-based (social epidemiologic) approach that combines survey and 
      neuroimaging data to predict chronic pain risk based on one's socioeconomic 
      conditions. The recommendations in this article address how we can leverage 
      pain's complexity in service of the patient and society by modeling not just 
      individuals and populations, but also the socioeconomic structures that shape any 
      individual's expectations of threat, safety, and resource availability.

AB  - First two decades of the twenty-first century are characterised by epidemics of 
      non-communicable diseases such as many hundreds of millions of patients diagnosed 
      with cardiovascular diseases and the type 2 diabetes mellitus, breast, lung, 
      liver and prostate malignancies, neurological, sleep, mood and eye disorders, 
      amongst others. Consequent socio-economic burden is tremendous. Unprecedented 
      decrease in age of maladaptive individuals has been reported. The absolute 
      majority of expanding non-communicable disorders carry a chronic character, over 
      a couple of years progressing from reversible suboptimal health conditions to 
      irreversible severe pathologies and cascading collateral complications. The 
      time-frame between onset of SHS and clinical manifestation of associated 
      disorders is the operational area for an application of reliable risk assessment 
      tools and predictive diagnostics followed by the cost-effective targeted 
      prevention and treatments tailored to the person. This article demonstrates 
      advanced strategies in bio/medical sciences and healthcare focused on suboptimal 
      health conditions in the frame-work of Predictive, Preventive and Personalised 
      Medicine (3PM/PPPM). Potential benefits in healthcare systems and for society at 
      large include but are not restricted to an improved life-quality of major 
      populations and socio-economical groups, advanced professionalism of 
      healthcare-givers and sustainable healthcare economy. Amongst others, following 
      medical areas are proposed to strongly benefit from PPPM strategies applied to 
      the identification and treatment of suboptimal health conditions:Stress overload 
      associated pathologiesMale and female healthPlanned pregnanciesPeriodontal 
      healthEye disordersInflammatory disorders, wound healing and pain management with 
      associated complicationsMetabolic disorders and suboptimal body 
      weightCardiovascular pathologiesCancersStroke, particularly of unknown aetiology 
      and in young individualsSleep medicineSports medicineImproved individual outcomes

TI  - New machine learning scoring system for predicting postoperative mortality in 
      gastroduodenal ulcer perforation: A study using a Japanese nationwide inpatient 
      database.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional prediction models for estimating risk of postoperative 
      mortality in gastroduodenal ulcer perforation have suboptimal prediction ability. 
      We aimed to develop and validate new machine learning models and an integer-based 
      score for predicting the postoperative mortality. METHODS: We retrospectively 
      identified patients with gastroduodenal ulcer perforation who underwent surgical 
      repair, using a nationwide Japanese inpatient database. In a derivation cohort 
      from July 2010 to March 2016, we developed 2 machine learning-based models, Lasso 
      and XGBoost, using 45 candidate predictors, and also developed an integer-based 
      score for clinical use by including important variables in Lasso. In a validation 
      cohort from April 2016 to March 2017, we measured the prediction performances of 
      the models by computing area under the curve and comparing it to the conventional 
      American Society of Anesthesiology risk score. RESULTS: Of 25,886 patients, 1,176 
      (4.5%) died after surgical repair. For the validation cohort, Lasso and XGBoost 
      had significantly higher prediction abilities than the American Society of 
      Anesthesiology score (Lasso area under the curve = 0.84; 95% confidence interval 
      0.81-0.86; American Society of Anesthesiology score area under the curve = 0.70; 
      95% confidence interval 0.65-0.74, P < .001). The integer-based risk score, which 
      had 13 factors, had a prediction ability similar to those of Lasso and XGBoost 
      (area under the curve = 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.86). According to 
      the integer-based score, the mortalities were 0.1%, 2.3%, 9.3%, and 29.0% for the 
      low (score, 0), moderate (1-2), high (3-4), and very high (≥5) score groups, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Machine learning models and the integer-based risk 
      score performed well in predicting risk of postoperative mortality in 
      gastroduodenal ulcer perforation. These models will help in decision making.

AB  - The future private gastroenterology practice will be a large multidisciplinary 
      practice including a clinic, AEC, pathology services, infusion services, 
      anesthesia services, pharmacy services, and imaging centers. Delivery of 
      gastrointestinal (GI) services will be a team-based clinic with AEC access and 
      improved quality of care. Competing technologies will drive practices to promote 
      the value of colonoscopy as the best screening test for colon cancer. Artificial 
      intelligence (AI) may significantly alter our approach to clinic and endoscopic 
      services. The creative and intellectual capital of practice leaders will continue 
      to define the private GI practice of the future.

TI  - Individually tailored self-management app-based intervention (selfBACK) versus a 
      self-management web-based intervention (e-Help) or usual care in people with low 
      back and neck pain referred to secondary care: protocol for a multiarm randomised 
      clinical trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) are common and costly 
      conditions. Self-management is a key element in the care of persistent LBP and 
      NP. Artificial intelligence can be used to support and tailor self-management 
      interventions, but their effectiveness needs to be ascertained. The aims of this 
      trial are (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of an individually tailored app-based 
      self-management intervention (selfBACK) adjunct to usual care in people with LBP 
      and/or NP in secondary care compared with usual care only, and (2) to compare the 
      effectiveness of selfBACK with a web-based self-management intervention without 
      individual tailoring (e-Help). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a randomised, 
      assessor-blind clinical trial with three parallel arms: (1) selfBACK app adjunct 
      to usual care; (2) e-Help website adjunct to usual care and (3) usual care only. 
      Patients referred to St Olavs Hospital, Trondheim (Norway) with LBP and/or NP and 
      accepted for assessment/treatment at the multidisciplinary outpatient clinic for 
      back or neck rehabilitation are invited to the study. Eligible and consenting 
      participants are randomised to one of the three arms with equal allocation ratio. 
      We aim to include 279 participants (93 in each arm). Outcome variables are 
      assessed at baseline (before randomisation) and at 6-week, 3-month and 6-month 
      follow-up. The primary outcome is musculoskeletal health measured by the 
      Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire at 3 months. A mixed-methods process 
      evaluation will document patients' and clinicians' experiences with the 
      interventions. A health economic evaluation will estimate the cost-effectiveness 
      of both interventions' adjunct to usual care. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial 
      is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in 
      Central Norway (Ref. 2019/64084). The results of the trial will be published in 
      peer-review journals and presentations at national and international conferences 
      relevant to this topic. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04463043.

AB  - According to a recently conducted survey on surgical complication mortality rate, 
      47% of such cases are due to anesthetics overdose. This indicates that there is 
      an urgent need to moderate the level of anesthesia. Recently deep learning (DL) 
      methods have played a major role in estimating the depth of Anesthesia (DOA) of 
      patients and has played an essential role in control anesthesia overdose. In this 
      paper, Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been used for the prediction of 
      DOA. EEG signals are very complex signals which may require months of training 
      and advanced signal processing techniques. It is a point of debate whether DL 
      methods are an improvement over the already existing traditional EEG signal 
      processing approaches. One of the DL algorithms is Convolutional neural network 
      (CNN) which is very popular algorithm for object recognition and is widely 
      growing its applications in processing hierarchy in the human visual system. In 
      this paper, various decomposition methods have been used for extracting the 
      features EEG signal. After acquiring the necessary signals values in image 
      format, several CNN models have been deployed for classification of DOA depending 
      upon their Bispectral Index (BIS) and the signal quality index (SQI). The EEG 
      signals were converted into the frequency domain using and Empirical Mode 
      Decomposition (EMD), and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). However, 
      because of the inter mode mixing observed in EMD method; EEMD have been utilized 
      for this study. The developed CNN models were used to predict the DOA based on 
      the EEG spectrum images without the use of handcrafted features which provides 
      intuitive mapping with high efficiency and reliability. The best trained model 
      gives an accuracy of 83.2%. Hence, this provides further scope and research which 
      can be carried out in the domain of visual mapping of DOA using EEG signals and 
      DL methods.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics, Treatment Effectiveness, and Predictors of Response to 
      Pharmacotherapeutic Interventions Among Patients with Herpetic-Related Neuralgia: 
      A Retrospective Analysis.
PG  - 1511-1522
LID - 10.1007/s40122-021-00303-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment for herpetic-related neuralgia focuses on symptom 
      control by use of antiviral drugs, anticonvulsants, and tricyclic 
      antidepressants. We aimed to explore the clinical characteristics associated with 
      medication responsiveness, and to build a classifier for identification of 
      patients who have risk of inadequate pain management. METHODS: We recruited 
      herpetic-related neuralgia patients during a 3-year period. Patients were 
      stratified into a medication-resistant pain (MRP) group when the pain decrease in 
      the visual analogue scale (VAS) is < 3 points, and otherwise a 
      medication-sensitive pain (MSP) group. Multivariate logistic regression was 
      performed to determine the factors associated with MRP. We fitted four machine 
      learning (ML) models, namely logistic regression, random forest, supporting 
      vector machines (SVM), and naïve Bayes with clinical characteristics gathered at 
      admission to identify patients with MRP. RESULTS: A total of 213 patients were 
      recruited, and 132 (61.97%) patients were diagnosed with MRP. Subacute herpes 
      zoster (HZ) (vs. acute, OR 8.95, 95% CI 3.15-29.48, p = 0.0001), severe lesion 
      (vs. mild lesion, OR 3.84, 95% CI 1.44-10.81, p = 0.0084), depressed mood (unit 
      increase OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00-1.20, p = 0.0447), and hypertension (hypertension, 
      vs. no hypertension, OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.87, p = 0.0266) were significantly 
      associated with MRP. Among four ML models, SVM had the highest accuracy (0.917) 
      and receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (0.918) to 
      discriminate MRP from MSP. Phase of disease is the most important feature when 
      fitting ML models. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical characteristics collected before 
      treatment could be adopted to identify patients with MRP.

TI  - Reconstruction of missing channel in electroencephalogram using spatiotemporal 
      correlation-based averaging.
LID - 10.1088/1741-2552/ac23e2 [doi]
AB  - Objective.Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings often contain large segments with 
      missing signals due to poor electrode contact or other artifact contamination. 
      Recovering missing values, contaminated segments and lost channels could be 
      highly beneficial, especially for automatic classification algorithms, such as 
      machine/deep learning models, whose performance relies heavily on high-quality 
      data. The current study proposes a new method for recovering missing segments in 
      EEG.Approach.In the proposed method, the reconstructed segment is estimated by 
      substitution of the missing part of the signal with the normalized weighted sum 
      of other channels. The weighting process is based on inter-channel correlation of 
      the non-missing preceding and proceeding temporal windows. The algorithm was 
      designed to be computationally efficient. Experimental data from patients (N= 20) 
      undergoing general anesthesia due to elective surgery were used for the 
      validation of the algorithm. The data were recorded using a portable EEG device 
      with ten channels and a self-adhesive frontal electrode during induction of 
      anesthesia with propofol from waking state until burst suppression level, 
      containing lots of variation in both amplitude and frequency properties. The 
      proposed imputation technique was compared with another simple-structure 
      technique. Distance correlation (DC) was used as a measure of comparison 
      evaluation.Main results.: The proposed method, with an average DC of 82.48 ± 
      10.01 (µ± σ)%, outperformed its competitor with an average DC of 67.89 ± 14.12 
      (µ± σ)%. This algorithm also showed a better performance when increasing the 
      number of missing channels.Significance.the proposed technique provides an 
      easy-to-implement and computationally efficient approach for the reliable 
      reconstruction of missing or contaminated EEG segments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The burst suppression pattern in clinical electroencephalographic 
      (EEG) recordings is an important diagnostic tool because of its association with 
      comas of various etiologies, as with hypoxia, drug related intoxication or deep 
      anesthesia. The detection of bursts and the calculation of burst/suppression 
      ratio are often used to monitor the level of anesthesia during treatment of 
      status epilepticus. However, manual counting of bursts is a laborious process 
      open to inter-rater variation and motivates a need for automatic detection. 
      METHODS: We describe a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that detects bursts 
      in EEG and generates burst-per-minute estimates for the purpose of monitoring 
      sedation level in an intensive care unit (ICU). We validated the algorithm on 29 
      hours of burst annotated EEG data from 29 patients suffering from status 
      epilepticus and hemorrhage. RESULTS: We report competitive results in comparison 
      to neural networks learned via supervised learning. The mean absolute error (SD) 
      in bursts per minute was 0.93 (1.38). CONCLUSION: We present a novel burst 
      suppression detection algorithm that adapts to each patient individually, reports 
      bursts-per-minute quickly, and does not require manual fine-tuning unlike 
      previous approaches to burst-suppression pattern detection. SIGNIFICANCE: Our 
      algorithm for automatic burst suppression quantification can greatly reduce 
      manual oversight in depth of sedation monitoring.

AB  - Ultrasound guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) has emerged as a powerful technique 
      for pain management in the operating theatre. It uses ultrasound imaging to 
      visualize anatomical structures, the needle insertion and the delivery of the 
      anesthetic around the targeted nerve block. Detection of the nerves is a 
      difficult task, however, due to the poor quality of the ultrasound images. Recent 
      developments in pattern recognition and machine learning have heightened the need 
      for computer aided systems in many applications. This type of system can improve 
      UGRA practice. In many imaging situations nerves are not salient in images. 
      Generally, practitioners rely on the arteries as key anatomical structures to 
      confirm the positions of the nerves, making artery tracking an important aspect 
      for UGRA procedure. However, artery tracking in a noisy environment is a 
      challenging problem, due to the instability of the features. This paper proposes 
      a new method for real-time artery tracking in ultrasound images. It is based on 
      shape information to correct tracker location errors. A new objective function is 
      proposed, which defines an artery as an elliptical shape, enabling its robust 
      fitting in a noisy environment. This approach is incorporated in two well-known 
      tracking algorithms, and shows a systematic improvement over the original 
      trackers. Evaluations were performed on 71 videos of different axillary nerve 
      blocks. The results obtained demonstrated the validity of the proposed method.

TI  - Caution, "normal" BMI: health risks associated with potentially masked individual 
      underweight-EPMA Position Paper 2021.
PG  - 243-264
LID - 10.1007/s13167-021-00251-4 [doi]
AB  - An increasing interest in a healthy lifestyle raises questions about optimal body 
      weight. Evidently, it should be clearly discriminated between the standardised 
      "normal" body weight and individually optimal weight. To this end, the basic 
      principle of personalised medicine "one size does not fit all" has to be applied. 
      Contextually, "normal" but e.g. borderline body mass index might be optimal for 
      one person but apparently suboptimal for another one strongly depending on the 
      individual genetic predisposition, geographic origin, cultural and nutritional 
      habits and relevant lifestyle parameters-all included into comprehensive 
      individual patient profile. Even if only slightly deviant, both overweight and 
      underweight are acknowledged risk factors for a shifted metabolism which, if 
      being not optimised, may strongly contribute to the development and progression 
      of severe pathologies. Development of innovative screening programmes is 
      essential to promote population health by application of health risks assessment, 
      individualised patient profiling and multi-parametric analysis, further used for 
      cost-effective targeted prevention and treatments tailored to the person. The 
      following healthcare areas are considered to be potentially strongly benefiting 
      from the above proposed measures: suboptimal health conditions, sports medicine, 
      stress overload and associated complications, planned pregnancies, periodontal 
      health and dentistry, sleep medicine, eye health and disorders, inflammatory 
      disorders, healing and pain management, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular 
      disease, cancers, psychiatric and neurologic disorders, stroke of known and 
      unknown aetiology, improved individual and population outcomes under pandemic 
      conditions such as COVID-19. In a long-term way, a significantly improved 
      healthcare economy is one of benefits of the proposed paradigm shift from 
      reactive to Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (PPPM/3PM). A tight 
      collaboration between all stakeholders including scientific community, healthcare 
      givers, patient organisations, policy-makers and educators is essential for the 
      smooth implementation of 3PM concepts in daily practice.

LID - 10.1177/00034894211041222 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Major postoperative adverse events (MPAEs) following head and neck 
      surgery are not infrequent and lead to significant morbidity. The objective of 
      this study was to ascertain which factors are most predictive of MPAEs in 
      patients undergoing head and neck surgery. METHODS: A cohort study was carried 
      out based on data from patients registered in the National Surgical Quality 
      Improvement Program (NSQIP) from 2006 to 2018. All patients undergoing 
      non-ambulatory head and neck surgery based on Current Procedural Terminology 
      codes were included. Perioperative factors were evaluated to predict MPAEs within 
      30-days of surgery. Age was classified as both a continuous and categorical 
      variable. Retained factors were classified by attributable fraction and 
      C-statistic. Multivariate regression and supervised machine learning models were 
      used to quantify the contribution of age as a predictor of MPAEs. RESULTS: A 
      total of 43 701 operations were analyzed with 5106 (11.7%) MPAEs. The results of 
      supervised machine learning indicated that prolonged surgeries, anemia, free 
      tissue transfer, weight loss, wound classification, hypoalbuminemia, wound 
      infection, tracheotomy (concurrent with index head and neck surgery), American 
      Society of Anesthesia (ASA) class, and sex as most predictive of MPAEs. On 
      multivariate regression, ASA class (21.3%), hypertension on medication (15.8%), 
      prolonged operative time (15.3%), sex (13.1%), preoperative anemia (12.8%), and 
      free tissue transfer (9%) had the largest attributable fractions associated with 
      MPAEs. Age was independently associated with MPAEs with an attributable fraction 
      ranging from 0.6% to 4.3% with poor predictive ability (C-statistic 0.60). 
      CONCLUSION: Surgical, comorbid, and frailty-related factors were most predictive 
      of short-term MPAEs following head and neck surgery. Age alone contributed a 
      small attributable fraction and poor prediction of MPAEs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

TI  - Patient-ventilator asynchrony, impact on clinical outcomes and effectiveness of 
      interventions: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/s40560-021-00565-5 [doi]
LID - 50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is a common problem in patients 
      undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) in the intensive care unit (ICU), 
      and may accelerate lung injury and diaphragm mis-contraction. The impact of PVA 
      on clinical outcomes has not been systematically evaluated. Effective 
      interventions (except for closed-loop ventilation) for reducing PVA are not well 
      established. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
      investigate the impact of PVA on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing MV 
      (Part A) and the effectiveness of interventions for patients undergoing MV except 
      for closed-loop ventilation (Part B). We searched the Cochrane Central Register 
      of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO-ICTRP until 
      August 2020. In Part A, we defined asynchrony index (AI) ≥ 10 or ineffective 
      triggering index (ITI) ≥ 10 as high PVA. We compared patients having high PVA 
      with those having low PVA. RESULTS: Eight studies in Part A and eight trials in 
      Part B fulfilled the eligibility criteria. In Part A, five studies were related 
      to the AI and three studies were related to the ITI. High PVA may be associated 
      with longer duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 5.16 days; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 2.38 to 7.94; n = 8; certainty of evidence [CoE], low), 
      higher ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% CI 1.76 to 4.24; n = 6; CoE, 
      low), and higher hospital mortality (OR, 1.94; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.30; n = 5; CoE, 
      low). In Part B, interventions involving MV mode, tidal volume, and 
      pressure-support level were associated with reduced PVA. Sedation protocol, 
      sedation depth, and sedation with dexmedetomidine rather than propofol were also 
      associated with reduced PVA. CONCLUSIONS: PVA may be associated with longer MV 
      duration, higher ICU mortality, and higher hospital mortality. Physicians may 
      consider monitoring PVA and adjusting ventilator settings and sedatives to reduce 
      PVA. Further studies with adjustment for confounding factors are warranted to 
      determine the impact of PVA on clinical outcomes. Trial registration protocols.io

AB  - With the tremendous volume of data captured during surgeries and procedures, 
      critical care, and pain management, the field of anesthesiology is uniquely 
      suited for the application of machine learning, neural networks, and closed loop 
      technologies. In the past several years, this area has expanded immensely in both 
      interest and clinical applications. This article provides an overview of the 
      basic tenets of machine learning, neural networks, and closed loop devices, with 
      emphasis on the clinical applications of these technologies.

TI  - Identification of difficult to intubate patients from frontal face images using 
      an ensemble of deep learning models.

AB  - Failure to identify difficult intubation is the leading cause of 
      anesthesia-related death and morbidity. Despite preoperative airway assessment, 
      75-93% of difficult intubations are unanticipated, and airway examination methods 
      underperform, with sensitivities of 20-62% and specificities of 82-97%. To 
      overcome these impediments, we aim to develop a deep learning model to identify 
      difficult to intubate patients using frontal face images. We proposed an ensemble 
      of convolutional neural networks which leverages a database of celebrity facial 
      images to learn robust features of multiple face regions. This ensemble extracts 
      features from patient images (n = 152) which are subsequently classified by a 
      respective ensemble of attention-based multiple instance learning models. Through 
      majority voting, a patient is classified as difficult or easy to intubate. 
      Whereas two conventional bedside tests resulted in AUCs of 0.6042 and 0.4661, the 
      proposed method resulted in an AUC of 0.7105 using a cohort of 76 difficult and 
      76 easy to intubate patients. Generic features yielded AUCs of 0.4654-0.6278. The 
      proposed model can operate at high sensitivity and low specificity (0.9079 and 
      0.4474) or low sensitivity and high specificity (0.3684 and 0.9605). The proposed 
      ensembled model outperforms conventional bedside tests and generic features. Side 
      facial images may improve the performance of the proposed model. The proposed 
      method significantly surpasses conventional bedside tests and deep learning 
      methods. We expect our model will play an important role in developing deep 
      learning methods where frontal face features play an important role.

TI  - Machine Learning Based Hardware Architecture for DOA Measurement From Mice EEG.
PG  - 314-324
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2021.3093037 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research aims to design a hardware optimized machine learning 
      based Depth of Anesthesia (DOA) measurement framework for mice and its FPGA 
      implementation. METHODS: Electroencephalography or EEG signal is acquired from 16 
      mice in the Neural Interface Research (NIR) Laboratory of the City University of 
      Hong Kong. We present a logistic regression based approach with mathematically 
      uncomplicated feature extraction techniques for efficient hardware implementation 
      to estimate the DOA. RESULTS: With the extraction of only two features, the 
      proposed system can classify the state of consciousness with 94% accuracy for a 1 
      second EEG epoch, leading to a 100% accurate channel prediction after a 7 s 
      run-time on average. CONCLUSION: Through performance evaluation and comparative 
      study confirmed the efficacy of the prototype. SIGNIFICANCE: DOA is the measure 
      of consciousness to distinguish whether a patient is suitably anesthetized or not 
      during a surgical procedure. Traditionally the DOA is estimated by checking 
      biophysical responses of a patient during the surgery. However, the physical 
      symptoms can be misleading for a decisive conclusion due to the patient's health 
      condition or as a side-effect of anesthetic drugs. Recently, several 
      neuroscientific research works are correlating the EEG signal with conscious 
      states, which is likely to have less interference with the patient's medical 
      condition. This research presents the first-of-its-kind hardware implemented 
      automatic DOA computation system for mice.

TI  - Pain Intensity Assessment in Sickle Cell Disease Patients Using Vital Signs 
      During Hospital Visits.
PG  - 77-85
LID - 10.1007/978-3-030-68790-8_7 [doi]
AB  - Pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) is often associated with increased morbidity, 
      mortality, and high healthcare costs. The standard method for predicting the 
      absence, presence, and intensity of pain has long been self-report. However, 
      medical providers struggle to manage patients based on subjective pain reports 
      correctly and pain medications often lead to further difficulties in patient 
      communication as they may cause sedation and sleepiness. Recent studies have 
      shown that objective physiological measures can predict subjective self-reported 
      pain scores for inpatient visits using machine learning (ML) techniques. In this 
      study, we evaluate the generalizability of ML techniques to data collected from 
      50 patients over an extended period across three types of hospital visits (i.e., 
      inpatient, outpatient and outpatient evaluation). We compare five classification 
      algorithms for various pain intensity levels at both intra-individual (within 
      each patient) and inter-individual (between patients) level. While all the tested 
      classifiers perform much better than chance, a Decision Tree (DT) model performs 
      best at predicting pain on an 11-point severity scale (from 0-10) with an 
      accuracy of 0.728 at an inter-individual level and 0.653 at an intra-individual 
      level. The accuracy of DT significantly improves to 0.941 on a 2-point rating 
      scale (i.e., no/mild pain: 0-5, severe pain: 6-10) at an inter-individual level. 
      Our experimental results demonstrate that ML techniques can provide an objective 
      and quantitative evaluation of pain intensity levels for all three types of 
      hospital visits.

AB  - The fields of pediatric gastrointestinal endoscopy and sedation are critically 
      important to the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) disease in 
      children. Since its inception in the 1970s, pediatric endoscopy has benefitted 
      from tremendous technological innovation related to the design of the endoscope 
      and its associated equipment. Not only that, but expertise among pediatric 
      gastroenterologists has moved the field forward to include a full complement of 
      diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic procedures in children. In this review, we 
      discuss the remarkable history of pediatric endoscopy and highlight current 
      limitations and future advances in the practice and technology of pediatric 
      endoscopy and sedation.

      Segmentation.

AB  - Deep learning strategies have become ubiquitous optimization tools for medical 
      image analysis. With the appropriate amount of data, these approaches outperform 
      classic methodologies in a variety of image processing tasks. However, rare 
      diseases and pediatric imaging often lack extensive data. Specially, MRI are 
      uncommon because they require sedation in young children. Moreover, the lack of 
      standardization in MRI protocols introduces a strong variability between 
      different datasets. In this paper, we present a general deep learning 
      architecture for MRI homogenization that also provides the segmentation map of an 
      anatomical region of interest. Homogenization is achieved using an unsupervised 
      architecture based on variational autoencoder with cycle generative adversarial 
      networks, which learns a common space (i.e. a representation of the optimal 
      imaging protocol) using an unpaired image-to-image translation network. The 
      segmentation is simultaneously generated by a supervised learning strategy. We 
      evaluated our method segmenting the challenging anterior visual pathway using 
      three brain T1-weighted MRI datasets (variable protocols and vendors). Our method 
      significantly outperformed a non-homogenized multi-protocol U-Net.

TI  - Machine Learning Algorithm Using Electronic Chart-Derived Data to Predict 
      Delirium After Elderly Hip Fracture Surgeries: A Retrospective Case-Control 
      Study.
PG  - 634629
LID - 10.3389/fsurg.2021.634629 [doi]
LID - 634629
AB  - Background: Elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair surgery are at 
      increased risk of delirium due to aging, comorbidities, and frailty. But current 
      methods for identifying the high risk of delirium among hospitalized patients 
      have moderate accuracy and require extra questionnaires. Artificial intelligence 
      makes it possible to establish machine learning models that predict incident 
      delirium risk based on electronic health data. Methods: We conducted a 
      retrospective case-control study on elderly patients (≥65 years of age) who 
      received orthopedic repair with hip fracture under spinal or general anesthesia 
      between June 1, 2018, and May 31, 2019. Anesthesia records and medical charts 
      were reviewed to collect demographic, surgical, anesthetic features, and frailty 
      index to explore potential risk factors for postoperative delirium. Delirium was 
      assessed by trained nurses using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) every 12 h 
      during the hospital stay. Four machine learning risk models were constructed to 
      predict the incidence of postoperative delirium: random forest, eXtreme Gradient 
      Boosting (XGBoosting), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perception 
      (MLP). K-fold cross-validation was deployed to accomplish internal validation and 
      performance evaluation. Results: About 245 patients were included and 
      postoperative delirium affected 12.2% (30/245) of the patients. Multiple logistic 
      regression revealed that dementia/history of stroke [OR 3.063, 95% CI (1.231, 
      7.624)], blood transfusion [OR 2.631, 95% CI (1.055, 6.559)], and preparation 
      time [OR 1.476, 95% CI (1.170, 1.862)] were associated with postoperative 
      delirium, achieving an area under receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.779, 95% CI 
      (0.703, 0.856). The accuracy of machine learning models for predicting the 
      occurrence of postoperative delirium ranged from 83.67 to 87.75%. Machine 
      learning methods detected 16 risk factors contributing to the development of 
      delirium. Preparation time, frailty index uses of vasopressors during the 
      surgery, dementia/history of stroke, duration of surgery, and anesthesia were the 
      six most important risk factors of delirium. Conclusion: Electronic chart-derived 
      machine learning models could generate hospital-specific delirium prediction 
      models and calculate the contribution of risk factors to the occurrence of 
      delirium. Further research is needed to evaluate the significance and 
      applicability of electronic chart-derived machine learning models for the 
      detection risk of delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair 
      surgeries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early prediction of acute kidney injury (AKI) after liver 
      transplantation (LT) facilitates timely recognition and intervention. We aimed to 
      build a risk predictor of post-LT AKI via supervised machine learning and 
      visualize the mechanism driving within to assist clinical decision-making. 
      METHODS: Data of 894 cases that underwent liver transplantation from January 2015 
      to September 2019 were collected, covering demographics, donor characteristics, 
      etiology, peri-operative laboratory results, co-morbidities and medications. The 
      primary outcome was new-onset AKI after LT according to Kidney Disease Improving 
      Global Outcomes guidelines. Predicting performance of five classifiers including 
      logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting 
      machine (GBM) and adaptive boosting were respectively evaluated by the area under 
      the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, F1-score, 
      sensitivity and specificity. Model with the best performance was validated in an 
      independent dataset involving 195 adult LT cases from October 2019 to March 2021. 
      SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was applied to evaluate feature 
      importance and explain the predictions made by ML algorithms. RESULTS: 430 AKI 
      cases (55.1%) were diagnosed out of 780 included cases. The GBM model achieved 
      the highest AUC (0.76, CI 0.70 to 0.82), F1-score (0.73, CI 0.66 to 0.79) and 
      sensitivity (0.74, CI 0.66 to 0.8) in the internal validation set, and a 
      comparable AUC (0.75, CI 0.67 to 0.81) in the external validation set. High 
      preoperative indirect bilirubin, low intraoperative urine output, long anesthesia 
      time, low preoperative platelets, and graft steatosis graded NASH CRN 1 and above 
      were revealed by SHAP method the top 5 important variables contributing to the 
      diagnosis of post-LT AKI made by GBM model. CONCLUSIONS: Our GBM-based predictor 
      of post-LT AKI provides a highly interoperable tool across institutions to assist 
      decision-making after LT.

TI  - Prescription Opioid Laws and Opioid Dispensing in US Counties: Identifying 
      Salient Law Provisions With Machine Learning.
PG  - 868-876
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001404 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hundreds of laws aimed at reducing inappropriate prescription opioid 
      dispensing have been implemented in the United States, yet heterogeneity in 
      provisions and their simultaneous implementation have complicated evaluation of 
      impacts. We apply a hypothesis-generating, multistage, machine-learning approach 
      to identify salient law provisions and combinations associated with dispensing 
      rates to test in future research. METHODS: Using 162 prescription opioid law 
      provisions capturing prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) access, 
      reporting and administration features, pain management clinic provisions, and 
      prescription opioid limits, we used regularization approaches and random forest 
      models to identify laws most predictive of county-level and high-dose dispensing. 
      We stratified analyses by overdose epidemic phases-the prescription opioid phase 
      (2006-2009), heroin phase (2010-2012), and fentanyl phase (2013-2016)-to further 
      explore pattern shifts over time. RESULTS: PDMP patient data access provisions 
      most consistently predicted high-dispensing and high-dose dispensing counties. 
      Pain management clinic-related provisions did not generally predict dispensing 
      measures in the prescription opioid phase but became more discriminant of high 
      dispensing and high-dose dispensing counties over time, especially in the 
      fentanyl period. Predictive performance across models was poor, suggesting 
      prescription opioid laws alone do not strongly predict dispensing. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our systematic analysis of 162 law provisions identified patient data access and 
      several pain management clinic provisions as predictive of county prescription 
      opioid dispensing patterns. Future research employing other types of study 
      designs is needed to test these provisions' causal relationships with 
      inappropriate dispensing and to examine potential interactions between PDMP 
      access and pain management clinic provisions. See video abstract at,

TI  - Effect of Hypotension Prediction Index-guided intraoperative haemodynamic care on 
      depth and duration of postoperative hypotension: a sub-study of the Hypotension 
      Prediction trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraoperative and postoperative hypotension are associated with 
      morbidity and mortality. The Hypotension Prediction (HYPE) trial showed that the 
      Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) reduced the depth and duration of 
      intraoperative hypotension (IOH), without excess use of intravenous fluid, 
      vasopressor, and/or inotropic therapies. We hypothesised that intraoperative 
      HPI-guided haemodynamic care would reduce the severity of postoperative 
      hypotension in the PACU. METHODS: This was a sub-study of the HYPE study, in 
      which 60 adults undergoing elective noncardiac surgery were allocated randomly to 
      intraoperative HPI-guided or standard haemodynamic care. Blood pressure was 
      measured using a radial intra-arterial catheter, which was connected to a 
      FloTracIQ sensor. Hypotension was defined as MAP <65 mm Hg, and a hypotensive 
      event was defined as MAP <65 mm Hg for at least 1 min. The primary outcome was 
      the time-weighted average (TWA) of postoperative hypotension. Secondary outcomes 
      were absolute incidence, area under threshold for hypotension, and percentage of 
      time spent with MAP <65 mm Hg. RESULTS: Overall, 54/60 (90%) subjects (age 64 (8) 
      yr; 44% female) completed the protocol, owing to failure of the FloTracIQ device 
      in 6/60 (10%) patients. Intraoperative HPI-guided care was used in 28 subjects; 
      26 subjects were randomised to the control group. Postoperative hypotension 
      occurred in 37/54 (68%) subjects. HPI-guided care did not reduce the median 
      duration (TWA) of postoperative hypotension (adjusted median difference, vs 
      standard of care: 0.118; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0-0.332; P=0.112). 
      HPI-guidance reduced the percentage of time with MAP <65 mm Hg by 4.9% (adjusted 
      median difference: -4.9; 95% CI, -11.7 to -0.01; P=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Intraoperative HPI-guided haemodynamic care did not reduce the TWA of 
      postoperative hypotension.

TI  - Comparison of Feature Extraction Methods for Physiological Signals for Heat-Based 
      Pain Recognition.
LID - 10.3390/s21144838 [doi]
LID - 4838
AB  - While even the most common definition of pain is under debate, pain assessment 
      has remained the same for decades. But the paramount importance of precise pain 
      management for successful healthcare has encouraged initiatives to improve the 
      way pain is assessed. Recent approaches have proposed automatic pain evaluation 
      systems using machine learning models trained with data coming from behavioural 
      or physiological sensors. Although yielding promising results, machine learning 
      studies for sensor-based pain recognition remain scattered and not necessarily 
      easy to compare to each other. In particular, the important process of extracting 
      features is usually optimised towards specific datasets. We thus introduce a 
      comparison of feature extraction methods for pain recognition based on 
      physiological sensors in this paper. In addition, the PainMonit Database (PMDB), 
      a new dataset including both objective and subjective annotations for 
      heat-induced pain in 52 subjects, is introduced. In total, five different 
      approaches including techniques based on feature engineering and feature learning 
      with deep learning are evaluated on the BioVid and PMDB datasets. Our studies 
      highlight the following insights: (1) Simple feature engineering approaches can 
      still compete with deep learning approaches in terms of performance. (2) More 
      complex deep learning architectures do not yield better performance compared to 
      simpler ones. (3) Subjective self-reports by subjects can be used instead of 
      objective temperature-based annotations to build a robust pain recognition 
      system.

TI  - Management of Amelogenesis Imperfecta in Childhood: Two Case Reports.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18137204 [doi]
LID - 7204
AB  - Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is defined as an interruption of enamel formation 
      due to genetic inheritance. To prevent malfunction of the masticatory system and 
      an unaesthetic appearance, various treatment options are described. While 
      restoration with a compomer in the anterior region and stainless steel crowns in 
      the posterior region is recommended for deciduous dentition, the challenges when 
      treating such structural defects in mixed or permanent dentition are changing 
      teeth and growing jaw, allowing only temporary restoration. The purpose of this 
      case report is to demonstrate oral rehabilitation from mixed to permanent 
      dentition. The dentition of a 7-year-old patient with AI type I and a 12-year-old 
      patient with AI type II was restored under general anesthesia to improve their 
      poor aesthetics and increase vertical dimension, which are related to problems 
      with self-confidence and reduced oral health quality of life. These two cases 
      show the complexity of dental care for structural anomalies of genetic origin and 
      the challenges in rehabilitating the different phases of dentition.

TI  - Machine learning approaches in predicting ambulatory same day discharge patients 
      after total hip arthroplasty.
PG  - 779-783
LID - 10.1136/rapm-2021-102715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With continuing financial and regulatory pressures, practice of 
      ambulatory total hip arthroplasty is increasing. However, studies focusing on 
      selection of optimal candidates are burdened by limitations related to 
      traditional statistical approaches. Hereby we aimed to apply machine learning 
      algorithm to identify characteristics associated with optimal candidates. 
      METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included elective total hip arthroplasty 
      (n=63 859) recorded in National Surgical Quality Improvement Program dataset from 
      2017 to 2018. The main outcome was length of stay. A total of 40 candidate 
      variables were considered. We applied machine learning algorithms (multivariable 
      logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest models) to 
      predict length of stay=0 day. Models' accuracies and area under the curve were 
      calculated. RESULTS: Applying machine learning models to compare length of 
      stay=0 day to length of stay=1-3 days cases, we found area under the curve of 
      0.715, 0.762, and 0.804, accuracy of 0.65, 0.73, and 0.81 for logistic 
      regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest model, respectively. 
      Regarding the most important predictive features, anesthesia type, body mass 
      index, age, ethnicity, white blood cell count, sodium level, and alkaline 
      phosphatase were highlighted in machine learning models. CONCLUSIONS: Machine 
      learning algorithm exhibited acceptable model quality and accuracy. Machine 
      learning algorithms highlighted the as yet unrecognized impact of laboratory 
      testing on future patient ambulatory pathway assignment.

      controversial. Machine learning is an excellent alternative method for predicting 
      difficult laryngoscopy. This study aimed to develop and validate practical 
      predictive models for difficult laryngoscopy through machine learning. METHODS: 
      Variables for the prediction of difficult laryngoscopy included age, Mallampati 
      grade, body mass index, sternomental distance, and neck circumference. Difficult 
      laryngoscopy was defined as grade 3 and 4 by the Cormack-Lehane classification. 
      Pre-anesthesia and anesthesia data of 616 patients who had undergone anesthesia 
      at a single center were included. The dataset was divided into a base training 
      set (n = 492) and a base test set (n = 124), with equal distribution of difficult 
      laryngoscopy. Training data sets were trained with six algorithms (multilayer 
      perceptron, logistic regression, supportive vector machine, random forest, 
      extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine), and 
      cross-validated. The model with the highest area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC) was chosen as the final model, which was validated 
      with the test set. RESULTS: The results of cross-validation were best using the 
      light gradient boosting machine algorithm with Mallampati score x age and 
      sternomental distance as predictive model parameters. The predicted AUROC for the 
      difficult laryngoscopy class was 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.83; p =  
      0.014), and the recall (sensitivity) was 0.85. CONCLUSION: Predicting difficult 
      laryngoscopy is possible with three parameters. Severe damage resulting from 
      failure to predict difficult laryngoscopy with high recall is small with the 
      reported model. The model's performance can be further enhanced by additional 
      data training.

TI  - Exploratory Outlier Detection for Acceleromyographic Neuromuscular Monitoring: 
      Machine Learning Approach.
PG  - e25913
LID - 10.2196/25913 [doi]
LID - e25913
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perioperative quantitative monitoring of neuromuscular function in 
      patients receiving neuromuscular blockers has become internationally recognized 
      as an absolute and core necessity in modern anesthesia care. Because of their 
      kinetic nature, artifactual recordings of acceleromyography-based neuromuscular 
      monitoring devices are not unusual. These generate a great deal of cynicism among 
      anesthesiologists, constituting an obstacle toward their widespread adoption. 
      Through outlier analysis techniques, monitoring devices can learn to detect and 
      flag signal abnormalities. Outlier analysis (or anomaly detection) refers to the 
      problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study was motivated by the development of a smartphone app 
      intended for neuromuscular monitoring based on combined accelerometric and 
      angular hand movement data. During the paired comparison stage of this app 
      against existing acceleromyography monitoring devices, it was noted that the 
      results from both devices did not always concur. This study aims to engineer a 
      set of features that enable the detection of outliers in the form of erroneous 
      train-of-four (TOF) measurements from an acceleromyographic-based device. These 
      features are tested for their potential in the detection of erroneous TOF 
      measurements by developing an outlier detection algorithm. METHODS: A data set 
      encompassing 533 high-sensitivity TOF measurements from 35 patients was created 
      based on a multicentric open label trial of a purpose-built accelero- and 
      gyroscopic-based neuromuscular monitoring app. A basic set of features was 
      extracted based on raw data while a second set of features was purpose engineered 
      based on TOF pattern characteristics. Two cost-sensitive logistic regression 
      (CSLR) models were deployed to evaluate the performance of these features. The 
      final output of the developed models was a binary classification, indicating if a 
      TOF measurement was an outlier or not. RESULTS: A total of 7 basic features were 
      extracted based on raw data, while another 8 features were engineered based on 
      TOF pattern characteristics. The model training and testing were based on 
      separate data sets: one with 319 measurements (18 outliers) and a second with 214 
      measurements (12 outliers). The F1 score (95% CI) was 0.86 (0.48-0.97) for the 
      CSLR model with engineered features, significantly larger than the CSLR model 
      with the basic features (0.29 [0.17-0.53]; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The set of 
      engineered features and their corresponding incorporation in an outlier detection 
      algorithm have the potential to increase overall neuromuscular monitoring data 
      consistency. Integrating outlier flagging algorithms within neuromuscular 
      monitors could potentially reduce overall acceleromyography-based reliability 
      issues. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03605225;

TI  - The burden of dental care in Amelogenesis Imperfecta paediatric patients in the 
      UK NHS: a retrospective, multi-centred analysis.
PG  - 929-936
LID - 10.1007/s40368-021-00638-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The burden of dental care in Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) has not been 
      well described. This condition results in weak, discoloured and often sensitive 
      teeth. Specialist paediatric care is available for AI patients in the UK, but 
      treatment protocols and care provided are inconsistent. The aim of this study was 
      therefore to analyse the provision of treatment and burden of care for children 
      and families with AI across four Paediatric Dentistry centres in the UK. METHODS: 
      A retrospective evaluation of AI patient clinical records across four UK 
      consultant-led Paediatric Dentistry centres was completed. Frequency and duration 
      of care were recorded along with treatment and experience of inhalation sedation, 
      local and general anaesthetic. RESULTS: In total, 138 records were available for 
      analysis. The average patient age at first referral was 7.7 years (range 1-16 
      years) and families travelled an average 21.8 miles per appointment (range 
      0.2-286 miles). Patients attended on average 4.5 appointments per year for 
      5.8 years. In total, 65.2% had experience of local anaesthetic, 27.5% inhalation 
      sedation and 31.9% general anaesthetic. Dental treatment including restorations 
      and extractions were commonly required on multiple teeth per patient. CONCLUSION: 
      AI carries a high burden of specialist dental care to patients and families. 
      Specialist centres are required to provide longitudinal, comprehensive care.

TI  - Development of Guidance Techniques for Regional Anesthesia: Past, Present and 
      Future.
PG  - 1631-1641
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S316743 [doi]
AB  - Regional anesthesia has been widely used in clinical practice. Over the past 30 
      years, various guidance techniques have been developed for regional anesthesia 
      ranging from paresthesia progressing to neurostimulation and currently ultrasound 
      guidance. Especially, the use of point-of-care ultrasound greatly enhances the 
      success rate of regional anesthesia. However, the poor imaging quality of 
      ultrasound in patients with obesity, fat infiltration, etc., limits the use of 
      ultrasound. The combined use of ultrasound with neurostimulator, 
      electromyography, pressure monitoring, etc. is advocated in order to facilitate 
      regional anesthesia in this cohort of patients. The accumulated evidence has 
      shown that the ultrasound combined with other techniques (UCOT) can help to solve 
      the difficulties of puncture location caused by obesity, anatomical variation, 
      and other factors when using ultrasound guidance alone. In recent years, with the 
      development of medical image fusion and medical image artificial intelligence 
      identification technology, guidance techniques for regional anesthesia have 
      advanced considerably. To understand the advantages and disadvantages of the 
      various guidance techniques for regional anesthesia developed in recent years and 
      to guide their rational clinical application, this paper reviews these 
      techniques, describing the progression from the early use of paresthesia to the 
      latest UCOT, as well as the latest research on UCOT, and the prospects for the 
      development of new guidance techniques for regional anesthesia.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in perioperative management of major gastrointestinal 
      surgeries.
PG  - 2758-2770
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v27.i21.2758 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrated by machines is based on reinforcement 
      learning and revolves around the usage of algorithms. The purpose of this review 
      was to summarize concepts, the scope, applications, and limitations in major 
      gastrointestinal surgery. This is a narrative review of the available literature 
      on the key capabilities of AI to help anesthesiologists, surgeons, and other 
      physicians to understand and critically evaluate ongoing and new AI applications 
      in perioperative management. AI uses available databases called "big data" to 
      formulate an algorithm. Analysis of other data based on these algorithms can help 
      in early diagnosis, accurate risk assessment, intraoperative management, 
      automated drug delivery, predicting anesthesia and surgical complications and 
      postoperative outcomes and can thus lead to effective perioperative management as 
      well as to reduce the cost of treatment. Perioperative physicians, 
      anesthesiologists, and surgeons are well-positioned to help integrate AI into 
      modern surgical practice. We all need to partner and collaborate with data 
      scientists to collect and analyze data across all phases of perioperative care to 
      provide clinical scenarios and context. Careful implementation and use of AI 
      along with real-time human interpretation will revolutionize perioperative care, 
      and is the way forward in future perioperative management of major surgery.

TI  - Objective pain stimulation intensity and pain sensation assessment using machine 
      learning classification and regression based on electrodermal activity.

AB  - An objective measure of pain remains an unmet need of people with chronic pain, 
      estimated to be 1/3 of the adult population in the United States. The current 
      gold standard to quantify pain is highly subjective, based upon self-reporting 
      with numerical or visual analog scale (VAS). This subjectivity complicates pain 
      management and exacerbates the epidemic of opioid abuse. We have tested 
      classification and regression machine learning models to objectively estimate 
      pain sensation in healthy subjects using electrodermal activity (EDA). 
      Twenty-three volunteers underwent pain stimulation using thermal grills. Three 
      different "pain stimulation intensities" were induced for each subject, who 
      reported the "pain sensation" right after each stimulus using a VAS (0-10). EDA 
      data were collected throughout the experiment. For machine learning, we computed 
      validated features of EDA based on time-domain decomposition, spectral analysis, 
      and differential features. Models for estimation of pain stimulation intensity 
      and pain sensation achieved maximum macroaveraged geometric mean scores of 69.7% 
      and 69.2%, respectively, when three classes were considered ("No," "Low," and 
      "High"). Regression of levels of stimulation intensity and pain sensation 
      achieved R(2) values of 0.357 and 0.47, respectively. Overall, the high variance 
      and inconsistency of VAS scores led to lower performance of pain sensation 
      classification, but regression was better for pain sensation than stimulation 
      intensity. Our results provide that three levels of pain can be quantified with 
      good accuracy and physiological evidence that sympathetic responses recorded by 
      EDA are more correlated to the applied stimuli's intensity than to the pain 
      sensation reported by the subject.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and technology in COVID Era: A narrative review.
PG  - 28-34
LID - 10.4103/joacp.JOACP_558_20 [doi]
AB  - Application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical field during the 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era is being explored further due to its 
      beneficial aspects such as self-reported data analysis, X-ray interpretation, 
      computed tomography (CT) image recognition, and patient management. This 
      narrative review article included published articles from MEDLINE/PubMed, Google 
      Scholar and National Informatics Center egov mobile apps. The database was 
      searched for "Artificial intelligence" and "COVID-19" and "respiratory care unit" 
      written in the English language during a period of one year 2019-2020. The 
      relevance of AI for patients is in hands of people with digital health tools, 
      Aarogya setu app and Smartphone technology. AI shows about 95% accuracy in 
      detecting COVID-19-specific chest findings. Robots with AI are being used for 
      patient assessment and drug delivery to patients to avoid the spread of 
      infection. The pandemic outbreak has replaced the classroom method of teaching 
      with the online execution of teaching practices and simulators. AI algorithms 
      have been used to develop major organ tissue characterization and intelligent 
      pain management techniques for patients. The Blue-dot AI-based algorithm helps in 
      providing early warning signs. The AI model automatically identifies a patient in 
      respiratory distress based on face detection, face recognition, facial action 
      unit detection, expression recognition, posture, extremity movement analysis, 
      visitation frequency detection sound pressure, and light level detection. There 
      is now no looking back as AI and machine learning are to stay in the field of 
      training, teaching, patient care, and research in the future.

LID - 5072
AB  - Although advances in machine-learning healthcare applications promise great 
      potential for innovative medical care, few data are available on the 
      translational status of these new technologies. We aimed to provide a 
      comprehensive characterization of the development and status quo of clinical 
      studies in the field of machine learning. For this purpose, we performed a 
      registry-based analysis of machine-learning-related studies that were published 
      and first available in the ClinicalTrials.gov database until 2020, using the 
      database's study classification. In total, n = 358 eligible studies could be 
      included in the analysis. Of these, 82% were initiated by academic 
      institutions/university (hospitals) and 18% by industry sponsors. A total of 96% 
      were national and 4% international. About half of the studies (47%) had at least 
      one recruiting location in a country in North America, followed by Europe (37%) 
      and Asia (15%). Most of the studies reported were initiated in the medical field 
      of imaging (12%), followed by cardiology, psychiatry, anesthesia/intensive care 
      medicine (all 11%) and neurology (10%). Although the majority of the clinical 
      studies were still initiated in an academic research context, the first 
      industry-financed projects on machine-learning-based algorithms are becoming 
      visible. The number of clinical studies with machine-learning-related 
      applications and the variety of medical challenges addressed serve to indicate 
      their increasing importance in future clinical care. Finally, they also set a 
      time frame for the adjustment of medical device-related regulation and 
      governance.

LID - 10.3390/ani11061483 [doi]
LID - 1483
AB  - Pain causes behavioral, autonomic, and neuroendocrine changes and is a common 
      cause of animal welfare compromise in farm animals. Current societal and ethical 
      concerns demand better agricultural practices and improved welfare for food 
      animals. These guidelines focus on cattle, sheep, and pigs, and present the 
      implications of pain in terms of animal welfare and ethical perspectives, and its 
      challenges and misconceptions. We provide an overview of pain management 
      including assessment and treatment applied to the most common husbandry 
      procedures, and recommendations to improve animal welfare in these species. A 
      cost-benefit analysis of pain mitigation is discussed for food animals as well as 
      the use of pain scoring systems for pain assessment in these species. Several 
      recommendations are provided related to husbandry practices that could mitigate 
      pain and improve farm animal welfare. This includes pain assessment as one of the 
      indicators of animal welfare, the use of artificial intelligence for automated 
      methods and research, and the need for better/appropriate legislation, 
      regulations, and recommendations for pain relief during routine and husbandry 
      procedures.

TI  - Neurological Complications Acquired During Pediatric Critical Illness: 
      Exploratory "Mixed Graphical Modeling" Analysis Using Serum Biomarker Levels.
PG  - 906-914
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0000000000002776 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neurologic complications, consisting of the acute development of a 
      neurologic disorder, that is, not present at admission but develops during the 
      course of illness, can be difficult to detect in the PICU due to sedation, 
      neuromuscular blockade, and young age. We evaluated the direct relationships of 
      serum biomarkers and clinical variables to the development of neurologic 
      complications. Analysis was performed using mixed graphical models, a machine 
      learning approach that allows inference of cause-effect associations from 
      continuous and discrete data. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a previous 
      prospective observational study. SETTING: PICU, single quaternary-care center. 
      PATIENTS: Individuals admitted to the PICU, younger than18 years old, with 
      intravascular access via an indwelling catheter. INTERVENTIONS: None. 
      MEASUREMENTS: About 101 patients were included in this analysis. Serum (days 1-7) 
      was analyzed for glial fibrillary acidic protein, ubiquitin C-terminal 
      hydrolase-L1, and alpha-II spectrin breakdown product 150 utilizing enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assays. Serum levels of neuron-specific enolase, myelin basic 
      protein, and S100 calcium binding protein B used in these models were reported 
      previously. Demographic data, use of selected clinical therapies, lengths of 
      stay, and ancillary neurologic testing (head CT, brain MRI, and 
      electroencephalogram) results were recorded. The Mixed Graphical 
      Model-Fast-Causal Inference-Maximum algorithm was applied to the dataset. MAIN 
      RESULTS: About 13 of 101 patients developed a neurologic complication during 
      their critical illness. The mixed graphical model identified peak levels of the 
      neuronal biomarker neuron-specific enolase and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1, 
      and the astrocyte biomarker glial fibrillary acidic protein to be the direct 
      causal determinants for the development of a neurologic complication; in 
      contrast, clinical variables including age, sex, length of stay, and primary 
      neurologic diagnosis were not direct causal determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Graphical 
      models that include biomarkers in addition to clinical data are promising methods 
      to evaluate direct relationships in the development of neurologic complications 
      in critically ill children. Future work is required to validate and refine these 
      models further, to determine if they can be used to predict which patients are at 
      risk for/or with early neurologic complications.

TI  - Mathematical and Computational Models for Pain: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 2806-2817

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is no single prevailing theory of pain that explains its origin, 
      qualities, and alleviation. Although many studies have investigated various 
      molecular targets for pain management, few have attempted to examine the etiology 
      or working mechanisms of pain through mathematical or computational model 
      development. In this systematic review, we identified and classified mathematical 
      and computational models for characterizing pain. METHODS: The databases queried 
      were Science Direct and PubMed, yielding 560 articles published prior to January 
      1st, 2020. After screening for inclusion of mathematical or computational models 
      of pain, 31 articles were deemed relevant. RESULTS: Most of the reviewed articles 
      utilized classification algorithms to categorize pain and no-pain conditions. We 
      found the literature heavily focused on the application of existing models or 
      machine learning algorithms to identify the presence or absence of pain, rather 
      than to explore features of pain that may be used for diagnostics and treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although understudied, the development of mathematical models may 
      augment the current understanding of pain by providing directions for testable 
      hypotheses of its underlying mechanisms. Additional focus is needed on developing 
      models that seek to understand the underlying mechanisms of pain, as this could 
      potentially lead to major breakthroughs in its treatment.

TI  - Machine Learning Approach to Optimize Sedation Use in Endoscopic Procedures.
PG  - 183-187
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210145 [doi]
AB  - Endoscopy procedures are often performed with either moderate or deep sedation. 
      While deep sedation is costly, procedures with moderate sedation are not always 
      well tolerated resulting in patient discomfort, and are often aborted. Due to 
      lack of clear guidelines, the decision to utilize moderate sedation or anesthesia 
      for a procedure is made by the providers, leading to high variability in clinical 
      practice. The objective of this study was to build a Machine Learning (ML) model 
      that predicts if a colonoscopy can be successfully completed with moderate 
      sedation based on patients' demographics, comorbidities, and prescribed 
      medications. XGBoost model was trained and tested on 10,025 colonoscopies (70% - 
      30%) performed at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). XGBoost 
      achieved average area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 
      0.762, F1-score to predict procedures that need moderate sedation was 0.85, and 
      precision and recall were 0.81 and 0.89 respectively. The proposed model can be 
      employed as a decision support tool for physicians to bolster their confidence 
      while choosing between moderate sedation and anesthesia for a colonoscopy 
      procedure.

TI  - Neural Machine Translation-Based Automated Current Procedural Terminology 
      Classification System Using Procedure Text: Development and Validation Study.
PG  - e22461
LID - 10.2196/22461 [doi]
LID - e22461
AB  - BACKGROUND: Administrative costs for billing and insurance-related activities in 
      the United States are substantial. One critical cause of the high overhead of 
      administrative costs is medical billing errors. With advanced deep learning 
      techniques, developing advanced models to predict hospital and professional 
      billing codes has become feasible. These models can be used for administrative 
      cost reduction and billing process improvements. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim 
      to develop an automated anesthesiology current procedural terminology (CPT) 
      prediction system that translates manually entered surgical procedure text into 
      standard forms using neural machine translation (NMT) techniques. The standard 
      forms are calculated using similarity scores to predict the most appropriate CPT 
      codes. Although this system aims to enhance medical billing coding accuracy to 
      reduce administrative costs, we compare its performance with that of previously 
      developed machine learning algorithms. METHODS: We collected and analyzed all 
      operative procedures performed at Michigan Medicine between January 2017 and June 
      2019 (2.5 years). The first 2 years of data were used to train and validate the 
      existing models and compare the results from the NMT-based model. Data from 2019 
      (6-month follow-up period) were then used to measure the accuracy of the CPT code 
      prediction. Three experimental settings were designed with different data types 
      to evaluate the models. Experiment 1 used the surgical procedure text entered 
      manually in the electronic health record. Experiment 2 used preprocessing of the 
      procedure text. Experiment 3 used preprocessing of the combined procedure text 
      and preoperative diagnoses. The NMT-based model was compared with the support 
      vector machine (SVM) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. RESULTS: The NMT 
      model yielded the highest top-1 accuracy in experiments 1 and 2 at 81.64% and 
      81.71% compared with the SVM model (81.19% and 81.27%, respectively) and the LSTM 
      model (80.96% and 81.07%, respectively). The SVM model yielded the highest top-1 
      accuracy of 84.30% in experiment 3, followed by the LSTM model (83.70%) and the 
      NMT model (82.80%). In experiment 3, the addition of preoperative diagnoses 
      showed 3.7%, 3.2%, and 1.3% increases in the SVM, LSTM, and NMT models in top-1 
      accuracy over those in experiment 2, respectively. For top-3 accuracy, the SVM, 
      LSTM, and NMT models achieved 95.64%, 95.72%, and 95.60% for experiment 1, 
      95.75%, 95.67%, and 95.69% for experiment 2, and 95.88%, 95.93%, and 95.06% for 
      experiment 3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility 
      of creating an automated anesthesiology CPT classification system based on NMT 
      techniques using surgical procedure text and preoperative diagnosis. Our results 
      show that the performance of the NMT-based CPT prediction system is equivalent to 
      that of the SVM and LSTM prediction models. Importantly, we found that including 
      preoperative diagnoses improved the accuracy of using the procedure text alone.

AB  - We aimed to assess the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based 
      real-time anatomy identification software specifically developed to ease image 
      interpretation intended for ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block (UGPNB). 
      Forty healthy participants (20 women, 20 men) were enrolled to perform 
      interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and transversus abdominis plane 
      (TAP) blocks under ultrasound guidance using AI software by anesthesiology 
      trainees. During block practice by a trainee, once the software indicates 100% 
      scan success of each block associated anatomic landmarks, both raw and labeled 
      ultrasound images were saved, assessed, and validated using a 5-point scale by 
      expert validators. When trainees reached 100% scan success, accuracy scores of 
      the validators were noted. Correlation analysis was used whether the relationship 
      (r) according to demographics (gender, age, and body mass index: BMI) and block 
      type exist. The BMI (kg/m(2)) and age (year) of participants were 22.2 ± 3 and 
      32.2 ± 5.25, respectively. Assessment scores of validators for all blocks were 
      similar in male and female individuals. Mean assessment scores of validators were 
      not significantly different according to age and BMI except for TAP block, which 
      was inversely correlated with age and BMI (p = 0.01). AI technology can 
      successfully interpret anatomical structures in real-time sonography while 
      assisting young anesthesiologists during UGPNB practice.

TI  - Differential classification of states of consciousness using envelope- and 
      phase-based functional connectivity.

AB  - The development of sophisticated computational tools to quantify changes in the 
      brain's oscillatory dynamics across states of consciousness have included both 
      envelope- and phase-based measures of functional connectivity (FC), but there are 
      very few direct comparisons of these techniques using the same dataset. The goal 
      of this study was to compare an envelope-based (i.e. Amplitude Envelope 
      Correlation, AEC) and a phase-based (i.e. weighted Phase Lag Index, wPLI) measure 
      of FC in their classification of states of consciousness. Nine healthy 
      participants underwent a three-hour experimental anesthetic protocol with 
      propofol induction and isoflurane maintenance, in which five minutes of 
      128-channel electroencephalography were recorded before, during, and after 
      anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, at the following time points: Baseline; light 
      sedation with propofol (Light Sedation); deep unconsciousness following three 
      hours of surgical levels of anesthesia with isoflurane (Unconscious); five 
      minutes prior to the recovery of consciousness (Pre-ROC); and three hours 
      following the recovery of consciousness (Recovery). Support vector machine 
      classification was applied to the source-localized EEG in the alpha (8-13 Hz) 
      frequency band in order to investigate the ability of AEC and wPLI (separately 
      and together) to discriminate i) the four states from Baseline; ii) Unconscious 
      ("deep" unconsciousness) vs. Pre-ROC ("light" unconsciousness); and iii) 
      responsiveness (Baseline, Light Sedation, Recovery) vs. unresponsiveness 
      (Unconscious, Pre-ROC). AEC and wPLI yielded different patterns of global 
      connectivity across states of consciousness, with AEC showing the strongest 
      network connectivity during the Unconscious epoch, and wPLI showing the strongest 
      connectivity during full consciousness (i.e., Baseline and Recovery). Both 
      measures also demonstrated differential predictive contributions across 
      participants and used different brain regions for classification. AEC showed 
      higher classification accuracy overall, particularly for distinguishing 
      anesthetic-induced unconsciousness from Baseline (83.7 ± 0.8%). AEC also showed 
      stronger classification accuracy than wPLI when distinguishing Unconscious from 
      Pre-ROC (i.e., "deep" from "light" unconsciousness) (AEC: 66.3 ± 1.2%; wPLI: 
      56.2 ± 1.3%), and when distinguishing between responsiveness and unresponsiveness 
      (AEC: 76.0 ± 1.3%; wPLI: 63.6 ± 1.8%). Classification accuracy was not improved 
      compared to AEC when both AEC and wPLI were combined. This analysis of 
      source-localized EEG data demonstrates that envelope- and phase-based FC provide 
      different information about states of consciousness but that, on a group level, 
      AEC is better able to detect relative alterations in brain FC across levels of 
      anesthetic-induced unconsciousness compared to wPLI.

AB  - PURPOSE: The study explored the clinical influence, effectiveness, limitations, 
      and human comparison outcomes of machine learning in diagnosing (1) dental 
      diseases, (2) periodontal diseases, (3) trauma and neuralgias, (4) cysts and 
      tumors, (5) glandular disorders, and (6) bone and temporomandibular joint as 
      possible causes of dental and orofacial pain. METHOD: Scopus, PubMed, and Web of 
      Science (all databases) were searched by 2 reviewers until 29(th) October 2020. 
      Articles were screened and narratively synthesized according to PRISMA-DTA 
      guidelines based on predefined eligibility criteria. Articles that made direct 
      reference test comparisons to human clinicians were evaluated using the MI-CLAIM 
      checklist. The risk of bias was assessed by JBI-DTA critical appraisal, and 
      certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Information 
      regarding the quantification method of dental pain and disease, the conditional 
      characteristics of both training and test data cohort in the machine learning, 
      diagnostic outcomes, and diagnostic test comparisons with clinicians, where 
      applicable, were extracted. RESULTS: 34 eligible articles were found for data 
      synthesis, of which 8 articles made direct reference comparisons to human 
      clinicians. 7 papers scored over 13 (out of the evaluated 15 points) in the 
      MI-CLAIM approach with all papers scoring 5+ (out of 7) in JBI-DTA appraisals. 
      GRADE approach revealed serious risks of bias and inconsistencies with most 
      studies containing more positive cases than their true prevalence in order to 
      facilitate machine learning. Patient-perceived symptoms and clinical history were 
      generally found to be less reliable than radiographs or histology for training 
      accurate machine learning models. A low agreement level between clinicians 
      training the models was suggested to have a negative impact on the prediction 
      accuracy. Reference comparisons found nonspecialized clinicians with less than 3 
      years of experience to be disadvantaged against trained models. CONCLUSION: 
      Machine learning in dental and orofacial healthcare has shown respectable results 
      in diagnosing diseases with symptomatic pain and with improved future iterations 
      and can be used as a diagnostic aid in the clinics. The current review did not 
      internally analyze the machine learning models and their respective algorithms, 
      nor consider the confounding variables and factors responsible for shaping the 
      orofacial disorders responsible for eliciting pain.

LID - 10.1002/art.41781 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is increasing demand for prediction of chronic pain treatment 
      outcomes using machine-learning models, in order to improve suboptimal pain 
      management. In this exploratory study, we used baseline brain functional 
      connectivity patterns from chronic pain patients with fibromyalgia (FM) to 
      predict whether a patient would respond differentially to either milnacipran or 
      pregabalin, 2 drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the 
      treatment of FM. METHODS: FM patients participated in 2 separate double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled crossover studies, one evaluating milnacipran (n = 15) and one 
      evaluating pregabalin (n = 13). Functional magnetic resonance imaging during rest 
      was performed before treatment to measure intrinsic functional brain connectivity 
      in several brain regions involved in pain processing. A support vector machine 
      algorithm was used to classify FM patients as responders, defined as those with a 
      ≥20% improvement in clinical pain, to either milnacipran or pregabalin. RESULTS: 
      Connectivity patterns involving the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) individually classified pregabalin 
      responders versus milnacipran responders with 77% accuracy. Performance of this 
      classification improved when both PCC and DLPFC connectivity patterns were 
      combined, resulting in a 92% classification accuracy. These results were not 
      related to confounding factors, including head motion, scanner sequence, or 
      hardware status. Connectivity patterns failed to differentiate drug nonresponders 
      across the 2 studies. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that brain functional 
      connectivity patterns used in a machine-learning framework differentially predict 
      clinical response to pregabalin and milnacipran in patients with chronic pain. 
      These findings highlight the promise of machine learning in pain prognosis and 
      treatment prediction.

AB  - In current anesthesiology practice, anesthesiologists infer the state of 
      unconsciousness without directly monitoring the brain. Drug- and patient-specific 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness 
      have been identified previously. We applied machine learning approaches to 
      construct classification models for real-time tracking of unconscious state 
      during anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. We used cross-validation to select and 
      train the best performing models using 33,159 2s segments of EEG data recorded 
      from 7 healthy volunteers who received increasing infusions of propofol while 
      responding to stimuli to directly assess unconsciousness. Cross-validated models 
      of unconsciousness performed very well when tested on 13,929 2s EEG segments from 
      3 left-out volunteers collected under the same conditions (median volunteer AUCs 
      0.99-0.99). Models showed strong generalization when tested on a cohort of 27 
      surgical patients receiving solely propofol collected in a separate clinical 
      dataset under different circumstances and using different hardware (median 
      patient AUCs 0.95-0.98), with model predictions corresponding with actions taken 
      by the anesthesiologist during the cases. Performance was also strong for 17 
      patients receiving sevoflurane (alone or in addition to propofol) (median AUCs 
      0.88-0.92). These results indicate that EEG spectral features can predict 
      unconsciousness, even when tested on a different anesthetic that acts with a 
      similar neural mechanism. With high performance predictions of unconsciousness, 
      we can accurately monitor anesthetic state, and this approach may be used to 
      engineer infusion pumps to intelligibly respond to patients' neural activity.

TI  - Creation of an artificial intelligence model for intubation difficulty 
      classification by deep learning (convolutional neural network) using face images: 
      an observational study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tracheal intubation is the gold standard for securing the airway, and 
      it is not uncommon to encounter intubation difficulties in intensive care units 
      and emergency rooms. Currently, there is a need for an objective measure to 
      assess intubation difficulties in emergency situations by physicians, residents, 
      and paramedics who are unfamiliar with tracheal intubation. Artificial 
      intelligence (AI) is currently used in medical imaging owing to advanced 
      performance. We aimed to create an AI model to classify intubation difficulties 
      from the patient's facial image using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which 
      links the facial image with the actual difficulty of intubation. METHODS: 
      Patients scheduled for surgery at Yamagata University Hospital between April and 
      August 2020 were enrolled. Patients who underwent surgery with altered facial 
      appearance, surgery with altered range of motion in the neck, or intubation 
      performed by a physician with less than 3 years of anesthesia experience were 
      excluded. Sixteen different facial images were obtained from the patients since 
      the day after surgery. All images were judged as "Easy"/"Difficult" by an 
      anesthesiologist, and an AI classification model was created using deep learning 
      by linking the patient's facial image and the intubation difficulty. Receiver 
      operating characteristic curves of actual intubation difficulty and AI model were 
      developed, and sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were 
      calculated; median AUC was used as the result. Class activation heat maps were 
      used to visualize how the AI model classifies intubation difficulties. RESULTS: 
      The best AI model for classifying intubation difficulties from 16 different 
      images was generated in the supine-side-closed mouth-base position. The accuracy 
      was 80.5%; sensitivity, 81.8%; specificity, 83.3%; AUC, 0.864; and 95% confidence 
      interval, [0.731-0.969], indicating that the class activation heat map was 
      concentrated around the neck regardless of the background; the AI model 
      recognized facial contours and identified intubation difficulties. CONCLUSION: 
      This is the first study to apply deep learning (CNN) to classify intubation 
      difficulties using an AI model. We could create an AI model with an AUC of 0.864. 
      Our AI model may be useful for tracheal intubation performed by inexperienced 
      medical staff in emergency situations or under general anesthesia.

      Method Validation Study.
PG  - e25258

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate, objective pain assessment is required in the health care 
      domain and clinical settings for appropriate pain management. Automated, 
      objective pain detection from physiological data in patients provides valuable 
      information to hospital staff and caregivers to better manage pain, particularly 
      for patients who are unable to self-report. Galvanic skin response (GSR) is one 
      of the physiologic signals that refers to the changes in sweat gland activity, 
      which can identify features of emotional states and anxiety induced by varying 
      pain levels. This study used different statistical features extracted from GSR 
      data collected from postoperative patients to detect their pain intensity. To the 
      best of our knowledge, this is the first work building pain models using 
      postoperative adult patients instead of healthy subjects. OBJECTIVE: The goal of 
      this study was to present an automatic pain assessment tool using GSR signals to 
      predict different pain intensities in noncommunicative, postoperative patients. 
      METHODS: The study was designed to collect biomedical data from postoperative 
      patients reporting moderate to high pain levels. We recruited 25 participants 
      aged 23-89 years. First, a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) 
      unit was employed to obtain patients' baseline data. In the second part, the 
      Empatica E4 wristband was worn by patients while they were performing 
      low-intensity activities. Patient self-report based on the numeric rating scale 
      (NRS) was used to record pain intensities that were correlated with objectively 
      measured data. The labels were down-sampled from 11 pain levels to 5 different 
      pain intensities, including the baseline. We used 2 different machine learning 
      algorithms to construct the models. The mean decrease impurity method was used to 
      find the top important features for pain prediction and improve the accuracy. We 
      compared our results with a previously published research study to estimate the 
      true performance of our models. RESULTS: Four different binary classification 
      models were constructed using each machine learning algorithm to classify the 
      baseline and other pain intensities (Baseline [BL] vs Pain Level [PL] 1, BL vs 
      PL2, BL vs PL3, and BL vs PL4). Our models achieved higher accuracy for the first 
      3 pain models than the BioVid paper approach despite the challenges in analyzing 
      real patient data. For BL vs PL1, BL vs PL2, and BL vs PL4, the highest 
      prediction accuracies were achieved when using a random forest classifier (86.0, 
      70.0, and 61.5, respectively). For BL vs PL3, we achieved an accuracy of 72.1 
      using a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. CONCLUSIONS: We are the first to propose 
      and validate a pain assessment tool to predict different pain levels in real 
      postoperative adult patients using GSR signals. We also exploited feature 
      selection algorithms to find the top important features related to different pain 
      intensities. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID):

AB  - Accepting surgical complications, especially those related to the learning curve, 
      as unavoidable events in colorectal procedures, is like accepting to fly onboard 
      an aircraft with a 10% to 20% chance of not arriving at final destination. Under 
      this condition, it is very likely that the aviation industry and the concurrent 
      reshaping of the world and of our lives would have not been possible in the 
      absence of high reliability and reproducibility of safe flights. It is hard to 
      imagine surgery without any intraoperative and/or postoperative complications. 
      Nevertheless, there is a plenty of room for improvement by simply adopting what 
      has been explicitly and scientifically demonstrated; training outside of the 
      operating room (OR), usage of modern information technologies and application of 
      evidence-based perioperative care protocols. Additionally, the possibility to 
      objectively measure and monitor the technical and even non-technical skills and 
      competencies of individual surgeons and even of OR teams through the application 
      of structured and validated assessment tools can finally put an end to the 
      self-referential, purely hierarchical, and indeed extremely unreliable process of 
      being authorized or not to perform operations on patients. Last but not least, a 
      wide range of new technologies spanning from augmented imaging modalities, 
      virtual reality for intraoperative guidance, improved robotic manipulators, 
      artificial intelligence to assist in preoperative patient specific risk 
      assessment, and intraoperative decision-making has the potential to tackle 
      several hidden roots of surgical complications.

TI  - Prediction of Prolonged Opioid Use After Surgery in Adolescents: Insights From 
      Machine Learning.
PG  - 304-313
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000005527 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term opioid use has negative health care consequences. Patients 
      who undergo surgery are at risk for prolonged opioid use after surgery (POUS). 
      While risk factors have been previously identified, no methods currently exist to 
      determine higher-risk patients. We assessed the ability of a variety of 
      machine-learning algorithms to predict adolescents at risk of POUS and to 
      identify factors associated with this risk. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study 
      was conducted using a national insurance claims database of adolescents aged 
      12-21 years who underwent 1 of 1297 surgeries, with general anesthesia, from 
      January 1, 2011 to December 30, 2017. Logistic regression with an L2 penalty and 
      with a logistic regression with an L1 lasso (Lasso) penalty, random forests, 
      gradient boosting machines, and extreme gradient boosted models were trained 
      using patient and provider characteristics to predict POUS (≥1 opioid 
      prescription fill within 90-180 days after surgery) risk. Predictive capabilities 
      were assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 
      (AUC)/C-statistic, mean average precision (MAP); individual decision thresholds 
      were compared using sensitivity, specificity, Youden Index, F1 score, and number 
      needed to evaluate. The variables most strongly associated with POUS risk were 
      identified using permutation importance. RESULTS: Of 186,493 eligible patient 
      surgical visits, 8410 (4.51%) had POUS. The top-performing algorithm achieved an 
      overall AUC of 0.711 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.699-0.723) and 
      significantly higher AUCs for certain surgeries (eg, 0.823 for spinal fusion 
      surgery and 0.812 for dental surgery). The variables with the strongest 
      association with POUS were the days' supply of opioids and oral morphine 
      milligram equivalents of opioids in the year before surgery. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Machine-learning models to predict POUS risk among adolescents show modest to 
      strong results for different surgeries and reveal variables associated with 
      higher risk. These results may inform health care system-specific identification 
      of patients at higher risk for POUS and drive development of preventative 
      measures.

AB  - The year 2020 was marred by the emergence of a deadly pandemic that disrupted 
      every aspect of life. Despite the disruption, notable research accomplishments in 
      the practice of cardiothoracic anesthesiology occurred in 2020 with an emphasis 
      on optimizing care, improving outcomes, and expanding what is possible for 
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This year's edition of Noteworthy Literature 
      Review will focus on specific themes in cardiac anesthesiology that include 
      preoperative anemia, predictors of acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery, 
      pain management modalities, anticoagulation strategies after transcatheter aortic 
      valve replacement, mechanical circulatory support, and future directions in 
      research.

TI  - Identifying anatomical structures on ultrasound: assistive artificial 
      intelligence in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia.
PG  - 802-809
LID - 10.1002/ca.23742 [doi]
AB  - Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia involves visualizing sono-anatomy to guide 
      needle insertion and the perineural injection of local anesthetic. Anatomical 
      knowledge and recognition of anatomical structures on ultrasound are known to be 
      imperfect amongst anesthesiologists. This investigation evaluates the performance 
      of an assistive artificial intelligence (AI) system in aiding the identification 
      of anatomical structures on ultrasound. Three independent experts in regional 
      anesthesia reviewed 40 ultrasound scans of seven body regions. Unmodified 
      ultrasound videos were presented side-by-side with AI-highlighted ultrasound 
      videos. Experts rated the overall system performance, ascertained whether 
      highlighting helped identify specific anatomical structures, and provided opinion 
      on whether it would help confirm the correct ultrasound view to a less 
      experienced practitioner. Two hundred and seventy-five assessments were performed 
      (five videos contained inadequate views); mean highlighting scores ranged from 
      7.87 to 8.69 (out of 10). The Kruskal-Wallis H-test showed a statistically 
      significant difference in the overall performance rating (χ(2) [6] = 36.719, 
      asymptotic p < 0.001); regions containing a prominent vascular landmark ranked 
      most highly. AI-highlighting was helpful in identifying specific anatomical 
      structures in 1330/1334 cases (99.7%) and for confirming the correct ultrasound 
      view in 273/275 scans (99.3%). These data demonstrate the clinical utility of an 
      assistive AI system in aiding the identification of anatomical structures on 
      ultrasound during ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia. Whilst further 
      evaluation must follow, such technology may present an opportunity to enhance 
      clinical practice and energize the important field of clinical anatomy amongst 
      clinicians.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Quality improvement programs for colorectal cancer surgery have been 
      introduced with benchmarking based on quality indicators, such as mortality. 
      Detailed (pre)operative characteristics may offer relevant information for proper 
      case-mix correction. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the added value of machine 
      learning to predict quality indicators for colorectal cancer surgery and identify 
      previously unrecognized predictors of 30-day mortality based on a large, 
      nationwide colorectal cancer registry that collected extensive data on 
      comorbidities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: All patients who underwent 
      resection for primary colorectal cancer registered in the Dutch ColoRectal Audit 
      between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016, were included. Multiple machine 
      learning models (multivariable logistic regression, elastic net regression, 
      support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting) were made to 
      predict quality indicators. Model performance was compared with conventionally 
      used scores. Risk factors were identified by logistic regression analyses and 
      Shapley additive explanations (ie, SHAP values). Statistical analysis was 
      performed between March 1 and September 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      primary outcome of this cohort study was 30-day mortality. Prediction models were 
      trained on a training set by performing 5-fold cross-validation, and outcomes 
      were measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve on 
      the test set. Machine learning was further used to identify risk factors, 
      measured by odds ratios and SHAP values. RESULTS: This cohort study included 
      62 501 records, most patients were male (35 116 [56.2%]), were aged 61 to 80 
      years (41 560 [66.5%]), and had an American Society of Anesthesiology score of II 
      (35 679 [57.1%]). A 30-day mortality rate of 2.7% (n = 1693) was found. The area 
      under the curve of the best machine learning model for 30-day mortality (0.82; 
      95% CI, 0.79-0.85) was significantly higher than the American Society of 
      Anesthesiology score (0.74; 95% CI, 0.71-0.77; P < .001), Charlson Comorbidity 
      Index (0.66; 95% CI, 0.63-0.70; P < .001), and preoperative score to predict 
      postoperative mortality (0.73; 95% CI, 0.70-0.77; P < .001). Hypertension, 
      myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma were 
      comorbidities with a high risk for increased mortality. Machine learning 
      identified specific risk factors for a complicated course, intensive care unit 
      admission, prolonged hospital stay, and readmission. Laparoscopic surgery was 
      associated with a decreased risk for all adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: This study found that machine learning methods outperformed 
      conventional scores to predict 30-day mortality after colorectal cancer surgery, 
      identified specific patient groups at risk for adverse outcomes, and provided 
      directions to optimize benchmarking in clinical audits.

AB  - Even with an improved understanding of pain mechanisms and advances in 
      perioperative pain management, inadequately controlled postoperative pain 
      remains. Predicting acute postoperative pain based on presurgery physiological 
      measures could provide valuable insights into individualized, effective analgesic 
      strategies, thus helping improve the analgesic efficacy. Considering the strong 
      correlation between pain perception and neural oscillations, we hypothesize that 
      acute postoperative pain could be predicted by neural oscillations measured 
      shortly before the surgery. Here, we explored the relationship between neural 
      oscillations 2 hours before the thoracoscopic surgery and the subjective 
      intensity of acute postoperative pain. The spectral power density of 
      resting-state beta and gamma band oscillations at the frontocentral region was 
      significantly different between patients with different levels of acute 
      postoperative pain (i.e., low pain vs. moderate/high pain). A positive 
      correlation was also observed between the spectral power density of resting-state 
      beta and gamma band oscillations and subjective reports of postoperative pain. 
      Then, we predicted the level of acute postoperative pain based on features of 
      neural oscillations using machine learning techniques, which achieved a 
      prediction accuracy of 92.54% and a correlation coefficient between the real pain 
      intensities and the predicted pain intensities of 0.84. Altogether, the 
      prediction of acute postoperative pain based on neural oscillations measured 
      before the surgery is feasible and could meet the clinical needs in the future 
      for better control of postoperative pain and other unwanted negative effects. The 
      study was registered on the Clinical Trial Registry 
      (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03761576?term=NCT03761576&draw=2&rank=1) 
      with the registration number NCT03761576.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Predicting difficult airway is challengeable in patients with limited 
      airway evaluation. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a model that 
      predicts difficult laryngoscopy by machine learning of neck circumference and 
      thyromental height as predictors that can be used even for patients with limited 
      airway evaluation. METHODS: Variables for prediction of difficulty laryngoscopy 
      included age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, neck circumference, and 
      thyromental distance. Difficult laryngoscopy was defined as Grade 3 and 4 by the 
      Cormack-Lehane classification. The preanesthesia and anesthesia data of 1677 
      patients who had undergone general anesthesia at a single center were collected. 
      The data set was randomly stratified into a training set (80%) and a test set 
      (20%), with equal distribution of difficulty laryngoscopy. The training data sets 
      were trained with five algorithms (logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, 
      random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine). 
      The prediction models were validated through a test set. RESULTS: The model's 
      performance using random forest was best (area under receiver operating 
      characteristic curve = 0.79 [95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.86], area under 
      precision-recall curve = 0.32 [95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.37]). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Machine learning can predict difficult laryngoscopy through a combination of 
      several predictors including neck circumference and thyromental height. The 
      performance of the model can be improved with more data, a new variable and 
      combination of models.

AB  - Objective: Predicting prognosis of in-hospital patients is critical. However, it 
      is challenging to accurately predict the life and death of certain patients at 
      certain period. To determine whether machine learning algorithms could predict 
      in-hospital death of critically ill patients with considerable accuracy and 
      identify factors contributing to the prediction power. Materials and Methods: 
      Using medical data of 1,384 patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit 
      (SICU) of our institution, we investigated whether machine learning algorithms 
      could predict in-hospital death using demographic, laboratory, and other 
      disease-related variables, and compared predictions using three different 
      algorithmic methods. The outcome measurement was the incidence of unexpected 
      postoperative mortality which was defined as mortality without pre-existing 
      not-for-resuscitation order that occurred within 30 days of the surgery or within 
      the same hospital stay as the surgery. Results: Machine learning algorithms 
      trained with 43 variables successfully classified dead and live patients with 
      very high accuracy. Most notably, the decision tree showed the higher 
      classification results (Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve, AUC = 0.96) than 
      the neural network classifier (AUC = 0.80). Further analysis provided the insight 
      that serum albumin concentration, total prenatal nutritional intake, and peak 
      dose of dopamine drug played an important role in predicting the mortality of 
      SICU patients. Conclusion: Our results suggest that machine learning algorithms, 
      especially the decision tree method, can provide information on structured and 
      explainable decision flow and accurately predict hospital mortality in SICU 
      hospitalized patients.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) refers to the complications of the 
      central nervous system before and after surgery in patients without mental 
      disorders. Many studies have shown that surgical anesthesia may cause POCD, 
      especially in elderly patients. This article aims to study the relationship 
      between artificial intelligence-based general anesthetics and postoperative 
      cognitive dysfunction. This article first describes and classifies artificial 
      intelligence, introduces its realization method, machine learning algorithms, and 
      briefly introduces the basic principles of regression and classification methods 
      in machine learning; then, the principles and techniques of general anesthetics 
      are proposed. The pathogenesis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is 
      explained in detail. Finally, the effect of anesthetics on postoperative 
      cognitive dysfunction is obtained from both inhaled anesthetics and intravenous 
      anesthetics. The impact on postoperative cognitive function is explained. The 
      experimental results in this article show that there is no statistically 
      significant difference in the two groups of patients' age, gender ratio, body 
      mass index, education level, preoperative comorbidities, and other general 
      indicators. Through the use of EEG bispectral index monitors to monitor the depth 
      of anesthesia and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, first, there was no 
      obvious relationship between the occurrence of postoperative cognitive 
      dysfunction at 1, 5, 10, and 50 days and discharge time. The comprehensive 
      monitoring group can reduce the clinical dose of preventive medication and 
      cis-atracurium and shorten the patient's recovery time, extubation time, and 
      recovery time. In addition, it can also reduce the increase of serum protein 
      S100β in elderly patients and reduce the incidence of early postoperative 
      cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - The rapid development of intelligent computer technology has promoted the 
      improvement of people's living standards and the application of the entire 
      intelligent system. In modern medicine, doctors use their accumulated experience 
      and medical knowledge to diagnose diseases and draw conclusions. In order to 
      effectively inherit the diagnosis experience accumulated by doctors, R&D 
      personnel put forward the idea of using artificial intelligence technology to 
      develop an intelligent auxiliary medical diagnosis system. Aiming at the 
      abovementioned machine-learning problems in the medical field, this article 
      mainly introduces the application research of propofol in oral and maxillofacial 
      surgery anesthesia based on smart medical blockchain technology. This paper 
      proposes a research method based on smart medical blockchain technology to assist 
      propofol in oral and maxillofacial surgery anesthesia, including support vector 
      machine data classification algorithm, decision tree data classification 
      algorithm, and machine-learning-based LSTM neural network. Research experiments 
      on the application of intelligent medical aid propofol in oral and maxillofacial 
      surgery anesthesia are conducted. The experimental results in this paper show 
      that the response time of the general business logic interface of the application 
      system of propofol in oral and maxillofacial surgery anesthesia based on smart 
      medical blockchain technology is about 41 milliseconds, which can better help 
      doctors in anesthesia and related treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine dosage for cesarean section is 
      difficult to predetermine. This study aimed to develop a decision-support model 
      using a machine-learning algorithm for assessing intrathecal hyperbaric 
      bupivacaine dose based on physical variables during cesarean section. METHODS: 
      Term parturients presenting for elective cesarean section under spinal 
      anaesthesia were enrolled. Spinal anesthesia was performed at the L3/4 interspace 
      with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine at dosages determined by the anesthesiologist. A 
      spinal spread level between T4-T6 was considered the appropriate block level. We 
      used a machine-learning algorithm to identify relevant parameters. The dataset 
      was split into derivation (80%) and validation (20%) cohorts. A decision-support 
      model was developed for obtaining the regression equation between optimized 
      intrathecal 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine volume and physical variables. RESULTS: A 
      total of 684 parturients were included, of whom 516 (75.44%) and 168 (24.56%) had 
      block levels between T4 and T6, and less than T6 or higher than T4, respectively. 
      The appropriate block level rate was 75.44%, with the mean bupivacaine volume 
      [1.965, 95%CI (1.945,1.984)]ml. In lasso regression, based on the principle of 
      predicting a reasonable dose of intrathecal bupivacaine with fewer physical 
      variables, the model is "Y=0.5922+ 0.055117* X(1)-0.017599*X(2)" (Y: bupivacaine 
      volume; X(1): vertebral column length; X(2): abdominal girth), with λ 0.055, MSE 
      0.0087, and R(2) 0.807. CONCLUSIONS: After applying a machine-learning algorithm, 
      we developed a decision model with R(2) 0.8070 and MSE due to error 0.0087 using 
      abdominal girth and vertebral column length for predicting the optimized 
      intrathecal 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine dosage during term cesarean sections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the most frequently encountered postoperative pulmonary 
      complications (PPC) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), which cause 
      high morbidity and mortality rates. We aimed to develop a model to predict 
      postoperative pneumonia in OLT patients using machine learning (ML) methods. 
      METHODS: Data of 786 adult patients underwent OLT at the Third Affiliated 
      Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 2015 to September 2019 was 
      retrospectively extracted from electronic medical records and randomly subdivided 
      into a training set and a testing set. With the training set, six ML models 
      including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest 
      (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and 
      gradient boosting machine (GBM) were developed. These models were assessed by the 
      area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic on the testing set. 
      The related risk factors and outcomes of pneumonia were also probed based on the 
      chosen model. RESULTS: 591 OLT patients were eventually included and 253 (42.81%) 
      were diagnosed with postoperative pneumonia, which was associated with increased 
      postoperative hospitalization and mortality (P < 0.05). Among the six ML models, 
      XGBoost model performed best. The AUC of XGBoost model on the testing set was 
      0.734 (sensitivity: 52.6%; specificity: 77.5%). Pneumonia was notably associated 
      with 14 items features: INR, HCT, PLT, ALB, ALT, FIB, WBC, PT, serum Na(+), TBIL, 
      anesthesia time, preoperative length of stay, total fluid transfusion and 
      operation time. CONCLUSION: Our study firstly demonstrated that the XGBoost model 
      with 14 common variables might predict postoperative pneumonia in OLT patients.

AB  - In the last 5 years, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have made rapid 
      advances for diagnosis and prognosis in fields ranging from dermatology to 
      anesthesiology. How do we make sense of the rise of AI in healthcare and 
      specifically in spine? How much of what we see today is "hype" and what will 
      remain when the dust settles? In this special issue, several reviews and original 
      articles help us understand the state of AI in healthcare today, the avenues for 
      future progress, and the implications for spine care.  Continued engagement, 
      skepticism, and collaboration with technical experts will allow for the 
      development of AI systems that complement and expand our abilities to diagnose, 
      predict, and operate.

TI  - What influences aromatase inhibitor continuation intention among breast cancer 
      survivors?
PG  - 49-57
LID - 10.4069/kjwhn.2021.01.19 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are widely prescribed for postmenopausal 
      women with breast cancer and are known to cause musculoskeletal pain. This study 
      aimed to identify factors associated with AI continuation intention among breast 
      cancer survivors (BCS). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 123 
      BCS (stages I-III), who had been taking AIs for at least 6 weeks. Participants 
      were recruited from a cancer center in Goyang, Korea, from September to November 
      2019. Descriptive statistics, Welch analysis of variance, Pearson correlation 
      coefficients, and simple linear regression were used for the analysis. RESULTS: 
      Beliefs about endocrine therapy was a significant predictor of AI continuation 
      intention (β=.66, p<.001). The majority of participants (87.0%) reported 
      experiencing musculoskeletal pain since taking AIs and the score for the worst 
      pain severity within 24 hours was 5.08±2.80 out of 10. Musculoskeletal pain, 
      however, was not associated with AI continuation intention. Fear of cancer 
      recurrence (FCR) was clinically significant (≥13) for 74.0% of the respondents 
      (mean, 17.62±7.14). Musculoskeletal pain severity and pain interference were 
      significantly associated with FCR (r=.21, p<.05; r=.35, p<.01, respectively). 
      Pain interference was significantly associated with beliefs about endocrine 
      therapy (r=-.18, p<.05). CONCLUSION: AI continuation intention can be modified by 
      reinforcing patients' beliefs about endocrine therapy. Musculoskeletal pain may 
      have a negative effect on beliefs about endocrine therapy and increase FCR among 
      BCS. Thus, awareness of musculoskeletal pain during AI therapy should be raised 
      and further research is required to develop multidisciplinary pain management 
      strategies and clinical guidelines to reinforce beliefs about endocrine therapy.

TI  - Use of Machine Learning to Develop and Evaluate Models Using Preoperative and 
      Intraoperative Data to Identify Risks of Postoperative Complications.
PG  - e212240
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.2240 [doi]
LID - e212240
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Postoperative complications can significantly impact perioperative 
      care management and planning. OBJECTIVES: To assess machine learning (ML) models 
      for predicting postoperative complications using independent and combined 
      preoperative and intraoperative data and their clinically meaningful 
      model-agnostic interpretations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      retrospective cohort study assessed 111 888 operations performed on adults at a 
      single academic medical center from June 1, 2012, to August 31, 2016, with a mean 
      duration of follow-up based on the length of postoperative hospital stay less 
      than 7 days. Data analysis was performed from February 1 to September 31, 2020. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included 5 postoperative complications: 
      acute kidney injury (AKI), delirium, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary 
      embolism (PE), and pneumonia. Patient and clinical characteristics available 
      preoperatively, intraoperatively, and a combination of both were used as inputs 
      for 5 candidate ML models: logistic regression, support vector machine, random 
      forest, gradient boosting tree (GBT), and deep neural network (DNN). Model 
      performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC). Model interpretations were generated using Shapley 
      Additive Explanations by transforming model features into clinical variables and 
      representing them as patient-specific visualizations. RESULTS: A total of 111 888 
      patients (mean [SD] age, 54.4 [16.8] years; 56 915 [50.9%] female; 82 533 [73.8%] 
      White) were included in this study. The best-performing model for each 
      complication combined the preoperative and intraoperative data with the following 
      AUROCs: pneumonia (GBT), 0.905 (95% CI, 0.903-0.907); AKI (GBT), 0.848 (95% CI, 
      0.846-0.851); DVT (GBT), 0.881 (95% CI, 0.878-0.884); PE (DNN), 0.831 (95% CI, 
      0.824-0.839); and delirium (GBT), 0.762 (95% CI, 0.759-0.765). Performance of 
      models that used only preoperative data or only intraoperative data was 
      marginally lower than that of models that used combined data. When adding 
      variables with missing data as input, AUROCs increased from 0.588 to 0.905 for 
      pneumonia, 0.579 to 0.848 for AKI, 0.574 to 0.881 for DVT, 0.5 to 0.831 for PE, 
      and 0.6 to 0.762 for delirium. The Shapley Additive Explanations analysis 
      generated model-agnostic interpretation that illustrated significant clinical 
      contributors associated with risks of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: The ML models for predicting postoperative complications with 
      model-agnostic interpretation offer opportunities for integrating risk 
      predictions for clinical decision support. Such real-time clinical decision 
      support can mitigate patient risks and help in anticipatory management for 
      perioperative contingency planning.

PG  - 159-165
LID - 10.1515/bmt-2020-0047 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of the detection of brief 
      periods of pain sensation based on cardiorespiratory signals during dental pain 
      triggers. Twenty patients underwent dental treatment and reported their pain 
      events by pressing a push button while ECG, PPG, and thoracic effort signals were 
      simultaneously recorded. Potential pain-indicating features were calculated from 
      the physiological data (sample length of 6 s) and were used for supervised 
      learning of a Random forest pain detector. The best feature combination was 
      determined by Feature forward selection. The best feature combination comprises 
      nine feature groups consisting of four respiratory and five cardiac related 
      groups. The final algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 
      63% with an AUC of 0.828. Using supervised learning it is possible to train an 
      algorithm to differentiate between short time intervals of pain and no pain 
      solely based on cardiorespiratory signals. An on-site and real-time detection and 
      rating of pain sensations would allow a precise, individuum- and 
      treatment-tailored administration of local anesthesia. Severe phases of pain 
      could be paused or avoided, this would allow more comfortable treatment and yield 
      better patient compliance.

PG  - e13445
LID - 10.7759/cureus.13445 [doi]
LID - e13445
AB  - Background The risk of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in using single-dose etomidate 
      for intubation among patients with sepsis remains controversial. Our aim was to 
      assess the prevalence of AI and characterize the risk factors in patients who 
      received etomidate for rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Methods This is a 
      retrospective study of prospectively-acquired data evaluating surgical intensive 
      care unit (SICU) patients who developed respiratory failure undergoing RSI. 
      Results Of the 44 adult SICU patients who developed respiratory failure, 34 
      patients received etomidate. The average age for the total cohort, for the 
      patients that received etomidate and for those who did not, was 70.91 ± 14.92, 
      72.82 ± 13.61 years and 64.40 ± 15.93, respectively. Twenty-four patients of the 
      total cohort (54.55%) developed AI; 26 had septic shock (59.09%), and 16 patients 
      had AI and septic shock (36.36%). There was no statistical significance between 
      the incidence of AI in patients who received etomidate (47%) and those who did 
      not (80%). However, in the subset of patients who received etomidate for RSI, 
      there was a non-significant trend toward increased incidence of AI in those who 
      were septic compared to those who were not (p = 0.06). Conclusion A single dose 
      of etomidate used for RSI in SICU patients is not associated with the development 
      of AI or mortality. However, a trend was shown, although not statistically 
      significant, towards the development of AI in septic patients. High-quality and 
      adequately powered randomized control trials (RCTs) are warranted.

AB  - Computed tomography colonography (CTC) has become a key examination in detecting 
      colonic polyps and colorectal carcinoma (CRC). It is particularly useful after 
      incomplete optical colonoscopy (OC) for patients with sedation risks and patients 
      anxious about the risks or potential discomfort associated with OC. CTC's main 
      advantages compared with OC are its non-invasive nature, better patient 
      compliance, and the ability to assess the extracolonic disease. Despite these 
      advantages, ionizing radiation remains the most significant burden of CTC. This 
      opinion review comprehensively addresses the radiation risk of CTC, incorporating 
      imaging technology refinements such as automatic tube current modulation, 
      filtered back projections, lowering the tube voltage, and iterative 
      reconstructions as tools for optimizing low and ultra-low dose protocols of CTC. 
      Future perspectives arise from integrating artificial intelligence in computed 
      tomography machines for the screening of CRC.

TI  - A Combinatorial Deep Learning Structure for Precise Depth of Anesthesia 
      Estimation From EEG Signals.
PG  - 3408-3415
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2021.3068481 [doi]
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used to measure the depth of anesthesia 
      (DOA) because EEG reflects surgical pain and state of the brain. However, precise 
      and real-time estimation of DOA index for painful surgical operations is 
      challenging due to problems such as postoperative complications and accidental 
      awareness. To tackle these problems, we propose a new combinatorial deep learning 
      structure involving convolutional neural networks (inspired by the inception 
      module), bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention layer. The 
      proposed model uses the EEG signal to continuously predicts the bispectral index 
      (BIS). It is trained over a large dataset, mostly from those under general 
      anesthesia with few cases receiving sedation/analgesia and spinal anesthesia. 
      Despite the imbalance distribution of BIS values in different levels of 
      anesthesia, our proposed structure achieves convincing root mean square error of 
      5.59 ± 1.04 and mean absolute error of 4.3 ± 0.87, as well as improvement in area 
      under the curve of 15% on average, which surpasses state-of-the-art DOA 
      estimation methods. The DOA values are also discretized into four levels of 
      anesthesia and the results demonstrate strong inter-subject classification 
      accuracy of 88.7% that outperforms the conventional methods.

AB  - Mortality after visceral surgery has decreased owing to progress in surgical 
      techniques, anesthesiology and intensive care. Mortality occurs in 5-10% of 
      patients after major surgery and remains a topic of interest. However, the ratio 
      of mortality after postoperative complications in relation to overall 
      complications varies between hospitals because of failure to rescue at the time 
      of the complication. There are multiple factors that lead to complication-related 
      mortality: they are patient-related, disease-related, but are related, above all, 
      to the timeliness of diagnosis of the complication, the organisational aspects of 
      management in private or public hospitals, hospital volume that corresponds to 
      the centralisation of initial management or to the concept of referral centre in 
      case of complications, to the team spirit, to communication between the health 
      care providers and to the management of the complication itself. Several 
      organisational advances are to be considered, such as the development of shorter 
      hospitalisations and notably ambulatory surgery, as well as enhanced recovery 
      programs. Remote monitoring and the contribution of artificial intelligence must 
      also be evaluated in this context. The reduction of mortality after visceral 
      surgery rests on several tactics: prevention of potentially lethal complications, 
      the all-important reduction of failure to rescue, and risk management before, 
      during and after hospitalisations that are increasingly shorter.

AB  - The neural substrates of consciousness remain elusive. Competing theories that 
      attempt to explain consciousness disagree on the contribution of frontal versus 
      posterior cortex and omit subcortical influences. This lack of understanding 
      impedes the ability to monitor consciousness, which can lead to adverse clinical 
      consequences. To test substrates and measures of consciousness, we recorded 
      simultaneously from frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and subcortical structures, 
      the striatum and thalamus, in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We 
      manipulated consciousness on a finer scale using thalamic stimulation, rousing 
      macaques from continuously administered anesthesia. Our results show that, unlike 
      measures targeting complexity, a measure additionally capturing neural 
      integration (Φ(∗)) robustly correlated with changes in consciousness. Machine 
      learning approaches show parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus contributed more 
      than frontal cortex to decoding differences in consciousness. These findings 
      highlight the importance of integration between parietal and subcortical 
      structures and challenge a key role for frontal cortex in consciousness.

TI  - Optimizing Motor Intention Detection With Deep Learning: Towards Management of 
      Intraoperative Awareness.
PG  - 3087-3097
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2021.3064794 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article shows the interest in deep learning techniques to detect 
      motor imagery (MI) from raw electroencephalographic (EEG) signals when a 
      functional electrical stimulation is added or not. Impacts of electrode montages 
      and bandwidth are also reported. The perspective of this work is to improve the 
      detection of intraoperative awareness during general anesthesia. METHODS: Various 
      architectures of EEGNet were investigated to optimize MI detection. They have 
      been compared to the state-of-the-art classifiers in Brain-Computer Interfaces 
      (based on Riemannian geometry, linear discriminant analysis), and other deep 
      learning architectures (deep convolution network, shallow convolutional network). 
      EEG data were measured from 22 participants performing motor imagery with and 
      without median nerve stimulation. RESULTS: The proposed architecture of EEGNet 
      reaches the best classification accuracy (83.2%) and false-positive rate (FPR 
      19.0%) for a setup with only six electrodes over the motor cortex and frontal 
      lobe and for an extended 4-38 Hz EEG frequency range while the subject is being 
      stimulated via a median nerve. Configurations with a larger number of electrodes 
      result in higher accuracy (94.5%) and FPR (6.1%) for 128 electrodes (and 
      respectively 88.0% and 12.9% for 13 electrodes). CONCLUSION: The present work 
      demonstrates that using an extended EEG frequency band and a modified EEGNet deep 
      neural network increases the accuracy of MI detection when used with as few as 6 
      electrodes which include frontal channels. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed method 
      contributes to the development of Brain-Computer Interface systems based on MI 
      detection from EEG.

TI  - In Silico Simulation of the Systemic Drug Exposure Following the Topical 
      Application of Opioid Analgesics in Patients with Cutaneous Lesions.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13020284 [doi]
LID - 284
AB  - The use of opioid analgesics in treating severe pain is frequently associated 
      with putative adverse effects in humans. Topical agents that are shown to have 
      high efficacy with a favorable safety profile in clinical settings are great 
      alternatives for pain management of multimodal analgesia. However, the risk of 
      side effects induced by transdermal absorption and systemic exposure is of great 
      concern as they are challenging to predict. The present study aimed to use 
      "BIOiSIM" an artificial intelligence-integrated biosimulation platform to predict 
      the transdermal disposition of opioid analgesics. The model successfully 
      predicted their exposure following the topical application of central opioid 
      agonist buprenorphine and peripheral agonist oxycodone in healthy human subjects 
      with simulation of intra-skin exposure in subjects with burns and pressure 
      wounds. The predicted plasma levels of analgesics were used to evaluate the 
      safety of the therapeutic pain control in patients with the dermal structural 
      impairments caused by acute (burns) or chronic cutaneous lesions (pressure 
      wounds) with topical opioid analgesics.

AB  - Monitoring the pain intensity in critically ill patients is crucial because 
      intense pain can cause adverse events, including poor survival rates; however, 
      continuous pain evaluation is difficult. Vital signs have traditionally been 
      considered ineffective in pain assessment; nevertheless, the use of machine 
      learning may automate pain assessment using vital signs. This retrospective 
      observational study was performed at a university hospital in Sendai, Japan. 
      Objective pain assessments were performed in eligible patients using the 
      Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT). Three machine-learning methods-random 
      forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR)-were 
      employed to predict pain using parameters, such as vital signs, age group, and 
      sedation levels. Prediction accuracy was calculated as the harmonic mean of 
      sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve (AUROC). Furthermore, 117,190 CPOT assessments were performed in 11,507 
      eligible patients (median age: 65 years; 58.0% males). We found that pain 
      prediction was possible with all three machine-learning methods. RF demonstrated 
      the highest AUROC for the test data (RF: 0.853, SVM: 0.823, and LR: 0.787). With 
      this method, pain can be objectively, continuously, and semi-automatically 
      evaluated in critically ill patients.

AB  - The aim of this study to investigate the effects of melamine exposure from the 
      weaning period on the developing brain in rats. Female Wistar albino rats (21 
      days old, n = 18) were divided into 3 groups, all animals were weighed daily and 
      dose-adjusted. For 3 weeks, 0.1 mL of saline was administered by oral gavage to 
      the control group, 50 mg/kg of melamine to the second group, and 75 mg/kg of 
      melamine to the third group were administered by oral gavage by dissolving in 
      0.1 mL of saline. On the postnatal 45th day, the rats were sacrificed under 
      anesthesia and brain tissues placed in neutral formalin. After routine tissue 
      processing, brain sections were stained with hematoxylin&eosin(H&E) and Terminal 
      deoxynucleotidyl transferase(TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling(TUNEL), IBA-1, Glial 
      Fibrillar Acidic Protein(GFAP), Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and SMI-70 
      antibodies as immunohistochemically. In the results, according to apoptotic 
      index(AI) results, there was a significant increase in the 75 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg 
      melamine groups compared to the control groups (p < 005). There was a significant 
      increase in the number of anti- TNF-α positive neurons and the number of 
      anti-GFAP positive astrocytes in both melamine groups compared to the control 
      group (p < 001). In terms of SMI-71, an increase was found in the 75 mg/kg group 
      compared to other groups (p < 001), while no significant difference was found 
      between the groups in terms of IBA-1 (p > 0.05). It has been observed an increase 
      in dilatation of blood vessels, inflammatory cell infiltration, and endothelial 
      cell degeneration in the 50 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg melamine groups compared to the 
      control group (p < 0.01). there was no statistically significant difference in 
      the body and brain weight between both melamine treatment groups (75 mg/kg and 
      50 mg/kg) and the control group (p > 005). Melamine exposure (50 mg/kg and 
      75 mg/kg) from the weaning period causes apoptosis and inflammation in the 
      developing brain, and the disruptions in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
      significantly increase exposure to 75 mg/kg.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To describe and analyze the pediatric neuroradiology 
      implicit curriculum for general-pediatric and neuro-pediatric radiology 
      fellowship training in order to define specific trainee needs and inform an 
      explicit pediatric neuroradiology curriculum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A focus 
      group of pediatric radiologists, pediatric neuroradiologists and fellows was 
      conducted to create a needs assessment questionnaire that focused on training 
      experience, current job, and a list of essential competency items. The 
      questionnaire was distributed to 175 members of the Society for Pediatric 
      Radiology. Data were derived from categorical and continuous survey variables. 
      Using an inductive approach, we analyzed and systematically inspected the data to 
      derive themes regarding trainee needs and how they might inform an explicit 
      curriculum. RESULTS: Fifty-seven pediatric radiologists (response rate of 33%) 
      responded to the survey. Sixty-three percent of respondents were fellowship 
      trained in general pediatric radiology, 21% in pediatric neuroradiology, and 16% 
      in both. In their current jobs, 75% of respondents were responsible for 
      interpreting some pediatric neuroradiology. 50% or greater reported limited or no 
      fellowship instruction in five areas of imaging interpretation: fetal 
      neuroimaging; ear and/or nose and/or throat imaging; head and neck imaging; 
      neuroembryology; neuro-spectroscopy and four areas of technical skills and/or 
      image quality: reducing imaging time; choice of contrast agents; sedation; 
      understanding clinical management pathways. CONCLUSION: Trainees endorse 
      inadequate training in certain aspects of imaging interpretation and technical 
      skills which are known to remain a significant and vital aspect of pediatric 
      neuroradiology practice, revealing an opportunity to emphasize these aspects in 
      an explicit curriculum and dedicate educational resources towards this cause.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study if limited frontotemporal electroencephalogram (EEG) can 
      guide sedation changes in highly infectious novel coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agent. METHODS: 98 days of 
      continuous frontotemporal EEG from 11 consecutive patients was evaluated daily by 
      an epileptologist to recommend reduction or maintenance of the sedative level. We 
      evaluated the need to increase sedation in the 6 h following this recommendation. 
      Post-hoc analysis of the quantitative EEG was correlated with the level of 
      sedation using a machine learning algorithm. RESULTS: Eleven patients were 
      studied for a total of ninety-eight sedation days. EEG was consistent with 
      excessive sedation on 57 (58%) and adequate sedation on 41 days (42%). 
      Recommendations were followed by the team on 59% (N = 58; 19 to reduce and 39 to 
      keep the sedation level). In the 6 h following reduction in sedation, increases 
      of sedation were needed in 7 (12%). Automatized classification of EEG sedation 
      levels reached 80% (±17%) accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Visual inspection of a limited 
      EEG helped sedation depth guidance. In a secondary analysis, our data supported 
      that this determination may be automated using quantitative EEG analysis. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Our results support the use of frontotemporal EEG for guiding 
      sedation in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Over the past decade, enhanced preoperative imaging and visualization, improved 
      delineation of the complex anatomical structures of the liver and pancreas, and 
      intra-operative technological advances have helped deliver the liver and 
      pancreatic surgery with increased safety and better postoperative outcomes. 
      Artificial intelligence (AI) has a major role to play in 3D visualization, 
      virtual simulation, augmented reality that helps in the training of surgeons and 
      the future delivery of conventional, laparoscopic, and robotic hepatobiliary and 
      pancreatic (HPB) surgery; artificial neural networks and machine learning has the 
      potential to revolutionize individualized patient care during the preoperative 
      imaging, and postoperative surveillance. In this paper, we reviewed the existing 
      evidence and outlined the potential for applying AI in the perioperative care of 
      patients undergoing HPB surgery.

TI  - Novel Analgesic Index for Postoperative Pain Assessment Based on a 
      Photoplethysmographic Spectrogram and Convolutional Neural Network: Observational 
      Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although commercially available analgesic indices based on biosignal 
      processing have been used to quantify nociception during general anesthesia, 
      their performance is low in conscious patients. Therefore, there is a need to 
      develop a new analgesic index with improved performance to quantify postoperative 
      pain in conscious patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a new 
      analgesic index using photoplethysmogram (PPG) spectrograms and a convolutional 
      neural network (CNN) to objectively assess pain in conscious patients. METHODS: 
      PPGs were obtained from a group of surgical patients for 6 minutes both in the 
      absence (preoperatively) and in the presence (postoperatively) of pain. Then, the 
      PPG data of the latter 5 minutes were used for analysis. Based on the PPGs and a 
      CNN, we developed a spectrogram-CNN index for pain assessment. The area under the 
      curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was measured to 
      evaluate the performance of the 2 indices. RESULTS: PPGs from 100 patients were 
      used to develop the spectrogram-CNN index. When there was pain, the mean (95% CI) 
      spectrogram-CNN index value increased significantly-baseline: 28.5 (24.2-30.7) 
      versus recovery area: 65.7 (60.5-68.3); P<.01. The AUC and balanced accuracy were 
      0.76 and 71.4%, respectively. The spectrogram-CNN index cutoff value for 
      detecting pain was 48, with a sensitivity of 68.3% and specificity of 73.8%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although there were limitations to the study design, we confirmed 
      that the spectrogram-CNN index can efficiently detect postoperative pain in 
      conscious patients. Further studies are required to assess the spectrogram-CNN 
      index's feasibility and prevent overfitting to various populations, including 
      patients under general anesthesia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Research

LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2021.01.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this era of value-based healthcare, costs must be measured 
      alongside patient outcomes to prioritize quality improvement and inform 
      performance-based reimbursement strategies. We sought to identify drivers of 
      costs for patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal 
      cancer. METHODS: Patients who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy for 
      esophageal cancer from December 2008 to March 2020 were included. Our 
      institutional Society of Thoracic Surgeons database was merged with financial 
      data to determine inpatient direct accounting costs in 2020 US dollars for total, 
      operative (surgery and anesthesia), and postoperative (intensive care, floor, 
      radiology, laboratory, etc) services. A supervised machine learning quantitative 
      method, the lasso estimator with 10-fold cross-validation, was applied to 
      identify predictors of costs. RESULTS: In the study cohort (n = 240) most had 
      ≥cT2 pathology (82%), adenocarcinoma histology (90%), and received neoadjuvant 
      therapy (78%). Mean length of stay was 8.00 days (SD, 4.13) with 45% inpatient 
      morbidity rate and no deaths. The largest proportions of cost were from the 
      operating room (30%), inpatient floor (30%), and postanesthesia care/intensive 
      care units (20%). Preoperative predictors of operative costs were age (-5.18% per 
      decade [95% confidence interval {CI}, -9.95 to -0.27], P = .039), body mass index 
      ≥ 30 (+12.9% [95% CI, 0.00-27.5], P = .050), forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
      (-3.24% per 10% forced expiratory volume in 1 second [95% CI, -5.80 to -0.61], 
      P = .017), and year of surgery (+2.55% [95% CI, 0.97-4.15], P = .002). Predictors 
      of postoperative costs were postoperative renal failure (+91.6% [95% CI, 
      9.93-233.8], P = .022), respiratory failure (+414.6% [95% CI, 158.7-923.6], 
      P < .001), pneumonia (+136.1% [95% CI, 71.1-225.8], P < .001), and reoperation 
      (+60.5% [95% CI, 21.5-111.9], P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Costs associated with 
      minimally invasive esophagectomy are driven by preoperative risk factors and 
      postoperative outcomes. These data enable surgeons and policymakers to reduce 
      cost variation, improve quality through standardization, and ultimately provide 
      greater value to patients.

PG  - e0244133
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0244133 [doi]
LID - e0244133
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an 
      effective treatment for improving the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). Accurate positioning of the stimulation electrodes is necessary for 
      better clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We applied deep learning techniques to 
      microelectrode recording (MER) signals to better predict motor function 
      improvement, represented by the UPDRS part III scores, after bilateral STN DBS in 
      patients with advanced PD. If we find the optimal stimulation point with MER by 
      deep learning, we can improve the clinical outcome of STN DBS even under 
      restrictions such as general anesthesia or non-cooperation of the patients. 
      METHODS: In total, 696 4-second left-side MER segments from 34 patients with 
      advanced PD who underwent bilateral STN DBS surgery under general anesthesia were 
      included. We transformed the original signal into three wavelets of 1-50 Hz, 
      50-500 Hz, and 500-5,000 Hz. The wavelet-transformed MER was used for input data 
      of the deep learning. The patients were divided into two groups, good response 
      and moderate response groups, according to DBS on to off ratio of UPDRS part III 
      score for the off-medication state, 6 months postoperatively. The ratio were used 
      for output data in deep learning. The Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16 model with a 
      multitask learning algorithm was used to estimate the bilateral effect of DBS. 
      Different ratios of the loss function in the task-specific layer were applied 
      considering that DBS affects both sides differently. RESULTS: When we divided the 
      MER signals according to the frequency, the maximal accuracy was higher in the 
      50-500 Hz group than in the 1-50 Hz and 500-5,000 Hz groups. In addition, when 
      the multitask learning method was applied, the stability of the model was 
      improved in comparison with single task learning. The maximal accuracy (80.21%) 
      occurred when the right-to-left loss ratio was 5:1 or 6:1. The area under the 
      curve (AUC) was 0.88 in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. 
      CONCLUSION: Clinical improvements in PD patients who underwent bilateral STN DBS 
      could be predicted based on a multitask deep learning-based MER analysis.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced into medicine and an AI-assisted 
      medicine will be the future that we should help to shape. In particular, 
      supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning will be the main methods to 
      play a role in the implementation of AI. Severely ill patients admitted to the 
      intensive care unit (ICU) are closely monitored in order to be able to quickly 
      respond to any changes. These monitoring data can be used to train AI models to 
      predict critical phases in advance, making an earlier reaction possible. To 
      achieve this a large amount of clinical data are needed in order to train models 
      and an external validation on independent cohorts should take place. Prospective 
      studies with treatment of patients admitted to the ICU with AI assistance should 
      show that they provide a benefit for patients. We present the most important 
      resources from de-identified (anonymized) patient data on open-source use for AI 
      research in intensive care medicine. The focus is on neurological diseases in the 
      ICU, therefore, we provide an overview of existing models for prediction of 
      outcome, vasospasms, intracranial pressure and levels of consciousness. To 
      introduce the advantages of AI in the clinical routine, more AI-based models with 
      larger datasets will be needed. To achieve this international cooperation is 
      absolutely necessary. Clinical centers associated with universities are needed to 
      provide a constant validation of applied models as these models can change during 
      use or a bias can develop during the training. A strong commitment to AI research 
      is important for Germany, not only with respect to academic achievements but also 
      in the light of a rapidly growing influence of AI on the economy.

TI  - Water immersion vs. air insufflation in canine duodenal endoscopy: is the future 
      underwater?
PG  - 581-588
LID - 10.24425/pjvs.2020.135804 [doi]
AB  - Endoscopy represents a commonly employed technique for canine enteropathies. 
      Different trials in human intestinal endoscopy have suggested that the 
      introduction of water for luminal distension, in place of air, improves the 
      visualization of the mucosal texture and decreases pain. The aim of the study was 
      to compare water immersion (WI) vs. air insufflation (AI) during duodenoscopy in 
      anesthetized dogs in terms of mucosal visualization and nociception. Twenty-five 
      dogs undergoing duodenoscopy were included. The same image of the descending 
      duodenum was recorded applying WI and AI. Each pair of images was analyzed using 
      morphological skeletonization, an image entropy evaluation, and a subjective 
      blind evaluation by three experienced endoscopists. To evaluate differences in 
      nociception related to the procedure applied, heart rate and arterial blood 
      pressure were measured before, during and after WI/AI. To compare the two 
      methods, a t-test for paired data was applied for the image analysis, Fleiss' 
      Kappa evaluation for the subjective evaluation and a Friedman test for anesthetic 
      parameters. No differences were found between WI and AI using morphological 
      skeletonization and entropy. The subjective evaluation identified the WI images 
      as qualitatively better than the AI images, indicating substantial agreement 
      between the operators. No differences in nociception were found. The results of 
      the study pointed out the absence of changes in pain response between WI and AI, 
      likely due to the sufficient control of nociception by the anesthesia. Based on 
      subjective evaluation, but not confirmed by the image analysis, WI provided 
      better image quality than AI.

TI  - Derivation and Validation of an Ensemble Model for the Prediction of Agitation in 
      Mechanically Ventilated Patients Maintained Under Light Sedation.
PG  - e279-e290
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000004821 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Light sedation is recommended over deep sedation for invasive 
      mechanical ventilation to improve clinical outcome but may increase the risk of 
      agitation. This study aimed to develop and prospectively validate an ensemble 
      machine learning model for the prediction of agitation on a daily basis. DESIGN: 
      Variables collected in the early morning were used to develop an ensemble model 
      by aggregating four machine learning algorithms including support vector 
      machines, C5.0, adaptive boosting with classification trees, and extreme gradient 
      boosting with classification trees, to predict the occurrence of agitation in the 
      subsequent 24 hours. SETTING: The training dataset was prospectively collected in 
      95 ICUs from 80 Chinese hospitals on May 11, 2016, and the validation dataset was 
      collected in 20 out of these 95 ICUs on December 16, 2019. PATIENTS: Invasive 
      mechanical ventilation patients who were maintained under light sedation for 24 
      hours prior to the study day and who were to be maintained at the same sedation 
      level for the next 24 hours. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
      A total of 578 invasive mechanical ventilation patients from 95 ICUs in 80 
      Chinese hospitals, including 459 in the training dataset and 119 in the 
      validation dataset, were enrolled. Agitation was observed in 36% (270/578) of the 
      invasive mechanical ventilation patients. The stepwise regression model showed 
      that higher body temperature (odds ratio for 1°C increase: 5.29; 95% CI, 
      3.70-7.84; p < 0.001), greater minute ventilation (odds ratio for 1 L/min 
      increase: 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30; p = 0.019), higher Richmond Agitation-Sedation 
      Scale (odds ratio for 1-point increase: 2.43; 95% CI, 1.92-3.16; p < 0.001), and 
      days on invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio for 1-d increase: 0.95; 95% 
      CI, 0.93-0.98; p = 0.001) were independently associated with agitation in the 
      subsequent 24 hours. In the validation dataset, the ensemble model showed good 
      discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.918; 
      95% CI, 0.866-0.969) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test p = 0.459) in 
      predicting the occurrence of agitation within 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      developed an ensemble model for the prediction of agitation in invasive 
      mechanical ventilation patients under light sedation. The model showed good 
      calibration and discrimination in an independent dataset.

      Disease.
LID - 10.3390/s21020544 [doi]
LID - 544
AB  - End stage renal disease (ESRD) is the last stage of chronic kidney disease that 
      requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Many studies reported a 
      higher risk of mortality in ESRD patients compared with patients without ESRD. In 
      this paper, we develop a model to predict postoperative complications, major 
      cardiac event, for patients who underwent any type of surgery. We compare several 
      widely-used machine learning models through experiments with our collected data 
      yellow of size 3220, and achieved F1 score of 0.797 with the random forest model. 
      Based on experimental results, we found that features related to operation (e.g., 
      anesthesia time, operation time, crystal, and colloid) have the biggest impact on 
      model performance, and also found the best combination of features. We believe 
      that this study will allow physicians to provide more appropriate therapy to the 
      ESRD patients by providing information on potential postoperative complications.

AB  - In the twenty-first century, the collaboration of control engineering and the 
      healthcare sector has matured to some extent; however, the future will have 
      promising opportunities, vast applications, and some challenges. Due to 
      advancements in processing speed, the closed-loop administration of drugs has 
      gained popularity for critically ill patients in intensive care units and routine 
      life such as personalized drug delivery or implantable therapeutic devices. For 
      developing a closed-loop drug delivery system, the control system works with a 
      group of technologies like sensors, micromachining, wireless technologies, and 
      pharmaceuticals. Recently, the integration of artificial intelligence techniques 
      such as fuzzy logic, neural network, and reinforcement learning with the 
      closed-loop drug delivery systems has brought their applications closer to fully 
      intelligent automatic healthcare systems. This review's main objectives are to 
      discuss the current developments, possibilities, and future visions in 
      closed-loop drug delivery systems, for providing treatment to patients suffering 
      from chronic diseases. It summarizes the present insight of closed-loop drug 
      delivery/therapy for diabetes, gastrointestinal tract disease, cancer, anesthesia 
      administration, cardiac ailments, and neurological disorders, from a perspective 
      to show the research in the area of control theory.

AB  - While deep neural networks (DNNs) and other machine learning models often have 
      higher accuracy than simpler models like logistic regression (LR), they are often 
      considered to be "black box" models and this lack of interpretability and 
      transparency is considered a challenge for clinical adoption. In healthcare, 
      intelligible models not only help clinicians to understand the problem and create 
      more targeted action plans, but also help to gain the clinicians' trust. One 
      method of overcoming the limited interpretability of more complex models is to 
      use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Standard GAMs simply model the target 
      response as a sum of univariate models. Inspired by GAMs, the same idea can be 
      applied to neural networks through an architecture referred to as Generalized 
      Additive Models with Neural Networks (GAM-NNs). In this manuscript, we present 
      the development and validation of a model applying the concept of GAM-NNs to 
      allow for interpretability by visualizing the learned feature patterns related to 
      risk of in-hospital mortality for patients undergoing surgery under general 
      anesthesia. The data consists of 59,985 patients with a feature set of 46 
      features extracted at the end of surgery to which we added previously not 
      included features: total anesthesia case time (1 feature); the time in minutes 
      spent with mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 mmHg 
      during surgery (6 features); and Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) 
      Code Descriptions of the Primary current procedure terminology (CPT) codes (33 
      features) for a total of 86 features. All data were randomly split into 80% for 
      training (n = 47,988) and 20% for testing (n = 11,997) prior to model 
      development. Model performance was compared to a standard LR model using the same 
      features as the GAM-NN. The data consisted of 59,985 surgical records, and the 
      occurrence of in-hospital mortality was 0.81% in the training set and 0.72% in 
      the testing set. The GAM-NN model with HCUP features had the highest area under 
      the curve (AUC) 0.921 (0.895-0.95). Overall, both GAM-NN models had higher AUCs 
      than LR models, however, had lower average precisions. The LR model without HCUP 
      features had the highest average precision 0.217 (0.136-0.31). To assess the 
      interpretability of the GAM-NNs, we then visualized the learned contributions of 
      the GAM-NNs and compared against the learned contributions of the LRs for the 
      models with HCUP features. Overall, we were able to demonstrate that our proposed 
      generalized additive neural network (GAM-NN) architecture is able to (1) leverage 
      a neural network's ability to learn nonlinear patterns in the data, which is more 
      clinically intuitive, (2) be interpreted easily, making it more clinically 
      useful, and (3) maintain model performance as compared to previously published 
      DNNs.

AB  - The objective of this retrospective study was to review the results of a 4-year 
      audit performed on anesthetic machines and vaporizers used in veterinary clinics 
      in Spain and Portugal. Data was collected between July 2016 and April 2020. 
      Inspections were carried out by a team of seven veterinarians, using a 
      human-modified system of checks that was adapted to a veterinary practice. The 
      evaluation of each item was noted as "correct" or "incorrect". The vaporizers' 
      performance was evaluated using a self-calibrating gas analyzer. The vaporizer 
      was classified as "correct" or "incorrect" when the vaporization error was less 
      than or equal to, or more than 20%, respectively. The anesthetic machine was 
      classified as "conforming" if all its components were noted as "correct" and no 
      leaks were detected, or as "non-conforming" if any of the components was noted as 
      "incorrect" or if a leak was detected. If the inspector was able to repair 
      on-site the item malfunctions detected and the machine was fit for use, they 
      issued a final report as "conforming." On the contrary, if such malfunctions 
      persisted, the final report was "non-conforming," and a recommendation to remove 
      the machine from service until its final repair was provided. To perform 
      statistical analysis, each inspected item was used as predictor, classification 
      and regression trees were built, and a random forest analysis was performed. A 
      total of 2,001 anesthetic machines and 2,309 vaporizers were studied. After 
      inspection, 42.7 and 26.4% of the machines were non-conforming and conforming, 
      respectively, whereas 30.9% could be repaired in situ. A total of 27.1% of the 
      isoflurane vaporizers and 35.9% of the sevoflurane vaporizers were incorrect. 
      Machine learning techniques showed that the most important variables in the 
      classification of the anesthetic machines as conforming or non-conforming were 
      mostly the scavenger system and the canister, followed some way behind by the APL 
      valve, source of oxygen, reservoir bag, vaporizer, and connections.

TI  - Using sensor-fusion and machine-learning algorithms to assess acute pain in 
      non-verbal infants: a study protocol.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Objective pain assessment in non-verbal populations is clinically 
      challenging due to their inability to express their pain via self-report. 
      Repetitive exposures to acute or prolonged pain lead to clinical instability, 
      with long-term behavioural and cognitive sequelae in newborn infants. Strong 
      analgesics are also associated with medical complications, potential 
      neurotoxicity and altered brain development. Pain scores performed by bedside 
      nurses provide subjective, observer-dependent assessments rather than objective 
      data for infant pain management; the required observations are labour intensive, 
      difficult to perform by a nurse who is concurrently performing the procedure and 
      increase the nursing workload. Multimodal pain assessment, using sensor-fusion 
      and machine-learning algorithms, can provide a patient-centred, 
      context-dependent, observer-independent and objective pain measure. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: In newborns undergoing painful procedures, we use facial 
      electromyography to record facial muscle activity-related infant pain, ECG to 
      examine heart rate (HR) changes and HR variability, electrodermal activity (skin 
      conductance) to measure catecholamine-induced palmar sweating, changes in oxygen 
      saturations and skin perfusion, and electroencephalography using active 
      electrodes to assess brain activity in real time. This multimodal approach has 
      the potential to improve the accuracy of pain assessment in non-verbal infants 
      and may even allow continuous pain monitoring at the bedside. The feasibility of 
      this approach will be evaluated in an observational prospective study of 
      clinically required painful procedures in 60 preterm and term newborns, and 
      infants aged 6 months or less. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Institutional Review 
      Board of the Stanford University approved the protocol. Study findings will be 
      published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, taught via 
      webinars, podcasts and video tutorials, and listed on academic/scientific 
      websites. Future studies will validate and refine this approach using the minimum 
      number of sensors required to assess neonatal/infant pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Factors associated with rebound pain after peripheral nerve block for ambulatory 
      surgery.
PG  - 862-871

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rebound pain is a common, yet under-recognised acute increase in pain 
      severity after a peripheral nerve block (PNB) has receded, typically manifesting 
      within 24 h after the block was performed. This retrospective cohort study 
      investigated the incidence and factors associated with rebound pain in patients 
      who received a PNB for ambulatory surgery. METHODS: Ambulatory surgery patients 
      who received a preoperative PNB between March 2017 and February 2019 were 
      included. Rebound pain was defined as the transition from well-controlled pain 
      (numerical rating scale [NRS] ≤3) while the block is working to severe pain (NRS 
      ≥7) within 24 h of block performance. Patient, surgical, and anaesthetic factors 
      were analysed for association with rebound pain by univariate, multivariable, and 
      machine learning methods. RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty-two (49.6%) of 972 
      included patients experienced rebound pain as per the definition. Multivariable 
      analysis showed that the factors independently associated with rebound pain were 
      younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-0.99), 
      female gender (OR 1.52 [1.15-2.02]), surgery involving bone (OR 1.82 
      [1.38-2.40]), and absence of perioperative i.v. dexamethasone (OR 1.78 
      [1.12-2.83]). Despite a high incidence of rebound pain, there were high rates of 
      patient satisfaction (83.2%) and return to daily activities (96.5%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Rebound pain occurred in half of the patients and showed independent associations 
      with age, female gender, bone surgery, and absence of intraoperative use of i.v. 
      dexamethasone. Until further research is available, clinicians should continue to 
      use preventative strategies, especially for patients at higher risk of 
      experiencing rebound pain.

AB  - Physicians use perioperative decision-support tools to mitigate risks and 
      maximize benefits to achieve the most successful outcome for patients. 
      Contemporary risk-assessment practices augment surgeons' judgement and experience 
      with decision-support algorithms driven by big data and machine learning. These 
      algorithms accurately assess risk for a wide range of postoperative complications 
      by parsing large datasets and performing complex calculations that would be 
      cumbersome for busy clinicians. Even with these advancements, large gaps in 
      perioperative risk assessment remain; decision-support algorithms often cannot 
      account for risk-reduction therapies applied during a patient's perioperative 
      course and do not quantify tradeoffs between competing goals of care (eg, 
      balancing postoperative pain control with the risk of respiratory depression or 
      balancing intraoperative volume resuscitation with the risk for complications 
      from pulmonary edema). Multiobjective optimization solutions have been applied to 
      similar problems successfully but have not yet been applied to perioperative 
      decision support. Given the large volume of data available via electronic medical 
      records, including intraoperative data, it is now feasible to successfully apply 
      multiobjective optimization in perioperative care. Clinical application of 
      multiobjective optimization would require semiautomated pipelines for analytics 
      and reporting model outputs and a careful development and validation process. 
      Under these circumstances, multiobjective optimization has the potential to 
      support personalized, patient-centered, shared decision-making with precision and 
      balance.

TI  - Case Report: Suppression of Harem Stallion Behavior and Fertility Following 
      Anti-Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Vaccination of a Captive Wild Przewalski's 
      Horse (Equus ferus przewalskii).
PG  - 569185

AB  - This report describes an option to modulate the testicular function of wild 
      horses and field methods to assess it. Non-surgical castration of a captive wild 
      Przewalski's stallion with anti-gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 
      immunization was performed by sub-cutaneous injection of two doses of 450 μg (3 
      ml) of GnRH conjugated to diphtheria toxin, further repeated every 6 months. 
      Semen quality was assessed after collection by electro-ejaculation under general 
      anesthesia. Endocrine and behavioral consequences were studied during a 2-year 
      follow-up period. The procedure of electro-ejaculation was safe and effective to 
      collect spermatozoa. Motility was low but was improved by a significant dilution 
      of sample (1v/4v-1v/5v) after collection. Immuno-neutering resulted in a decrease 
      of the total spermatozoa number and motility 1 month after primary vaccination. 
      However, infertility could not yet be guaranteed. Six months post-vaccination, 
      serum testosterone concentrations had decreased and the treated stallion had lost 
      his harem stallion role. Moreover, at the same time, the total spermatozoa number 
      was near zero with no motile spermatozoa, and offspring was no longer observed. 
      As a conclusion, electro-ejaculation under general anesthesia is suitable on wild 
      horses to obtain spermatozoa that should be washed or largely diluted before use 
      for artificial insemination (AI) programs. Anti-GnRH immuno-neutering protocol 
      led to a dramatic decrease of spermatozoa number, motility, and testosterone 
      production. This also induced deep changes in the social structure of the band. 
      Such technique could be considered as an alternative to surgical castration in 
      wild horses.

TI  - Using Machine Learning to Evaluate Attending Feedback on Resident Performance.
PG  - 545-555
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000005265 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-quality and high-utility feedback allows for the development of 
      improvement plans for trainees. The current manual assessment of the quality of 
      this feedback is time consuming and subjective. We propose the use of machine 
      learning to rapidly distinguish the quality of attending feedback on resident 
      performance. METHODS: Using a preexisting databank of 1925 manually reviewed 
      feedback comments from 4 anesthesiology residency programs, we trained machine 
      learning models to predict whether comments contained 6 predefined feedback 
      traits (actionable, behavior focused, detailed, negative feedback, 
      professionalism/communication, and specific) and predict the utility score of the 
      comment on a scale of 1-5. Comments with ≥4 feedback traits were classified as 
      high-quality and comments with ≥4 utility scores were classified as high-utility; 
      otherwise comments were considered low-quality or low-utility, respectively. We 
      used RapidMiner Studio (RapidMiner, Inc, Boston, MA), a data science platform, to 
      train, validate, and score performance of models. RESULTS: Models for predicting 
      the presence of feedback traits had accuracies of 74.4%-82.2%. Predictions on 
      utility category were 82.1% accurate, with 89.2% sensitivity, and 89.8% class 
      precision for low-utility predictions. Predictions on quality category were 78.5% 
      accurate, with 86.1% sensitivity, and 85.0% class precision for low-quality 
      predictions. Fifteen to 20 hours were spent by a research assistant with no prior 
      experience in machine learning to become familiar with software, create models, 
      and review performance on predictions made. The program read data, applied 
      models, and generated predictions within minutes. In contrast, a recent manual 
      feedback scoring effort by an author took 15 hours to manually collate and score 
      200 comments during the course of 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Harnessing the potential 
      of machine learning allows for rapid assessment of attending feedback on resident 
      performance. Using predictive models to rapidly screen for low-quality and 
      low-utility feedback can aid programs in improving feedback provision, both 
      globally and by individual faculty.

      prediction using non-linear machine learning algorithms.
PG  - 121-130

AB  - Brain monitors which track quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures to 
      monitor sedation levels are drug and patient specific. There is a need for robust 
      sedation level monitoring systems to accurately track sedation levels across all 
      drug classes, sex and age groups. Forty-four quantitative features estimated from 
      a pooled dataset of 204 EEG recordings from 66 healthy adult volunteers who 
      received either propofol, dexmedetomidine, or sevoflurane (all with and without 
      remifentanil) were used in a machine learning based automated system to estimate 
      the depth of sedation. Model training and evaluation were performed using 
      leave-one-out cross validation methodology. We trained four machine learning 
      models to predict sedation levels and evaluated the influence of remifentanil, 
      age, and sex on the prediction performance. The area under the receiver-operator 
      characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the prediction 
      model. The ensemble tree with bagging outperformed other machine learning models 
      and predicted sedation levels with an AUC = 0.88 (0.81-0.90). There were 
      significant differences in the prediction probability of the automated systems 
      when trained and tested across different age groups and sex. The performance of 
      the EEG based sedation level prediction system is drug, sex, and age specific. 
      Nonlinear machine-learning models using quantitative EEG features can accurately 
      predict sedation levels. The results obtained in this study may provide a useful 
      reference for developing next generation EEG based sedation level prediction 
      systems using advanced machine learning algorithms. Clinical trial registration: 
      NCT02043938 and NCT03143972.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning-aided drug discovery in central 
      nervous system diseases: State-of-the-arts and future directions.
PG  - 1427-1473
LID - 10.1002/med.21764 [doi]
AB  - Neurological disorders significantly outnumber diseases in other therapeutic 
      areas. However, developing drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders 
      remains the most challenging area in drug discovery, accompanied with the long 
      timelines and high attrition rates. With the rapid growth of biomedical data 
      enabled by advanced experimental technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and 
      machine learning (ML) have emerged as an indispensable tool to draw meaningful 
      insights and improve decision making in drug discovery. Thanks to the 
      advancements in AI and ML algorithms, now the AI/ML-driven solutions have an 
      unprecedented potential to accelerate the process of CNS drug discovery with 
      better success rate. In this review, we comprehensively summarize AI/ML-powered 
      pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementations in the CNS area. After 
      introducing the AI/ML models as well as the conceptualization and data 
      preparation, we outline the applications of AI/ML technologies to several key 
      procedures in drug discovery, including target identification, compound 
      screening, hit/lead generation and optimization, drug response and synergy 
      prediction, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. We review the current 
      state-of-the-art of AI/ML-guided CNS drug discovery, focusing on blood-brain 
      barrier permeability prediction and implementation into therapeutic discovery for 
      neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss the major challenges and limitations 
      of current approaches and possible future directions that may provide resolutions 
      to these difficulties.

TI  - Immersion and haptic feedback impacts on dental anesthesia technical skills 
      virtual reality training.
PG  - 589-598
LID - 10.1002/jdd.12503 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Administering anesthesia to the inferior alveolar nerve is 1 of the 
      most stressful processes in dental training. Most studies using virtual reality 
      (VR) for dental training have used non-immersive technologies. The purpose of 
      this work is to assess the impact of immersive technologies on skills training. 
      METHODS: On May 2019, an experimental study was conducted with 163 clinical 
      dental students, divided into 4 groups across 2 phases (preceptorship and 
      training) with haptic feedback either On or Off. The participants trained on the 
      inferior alveolar dental anesthesia procedure in a haptic VR simulator. Their 
      technical skills were evaluated in terms of needle insertion features which were 
      computed from a haptic device providing kinematic data. Also, the participants 
      reported their subjective experience with syringe handling and simulator 
      sickness. A machine learning method was implemented to automatically evaluate the 
      needle insertion point performance of the student. RESULTS: Groups receiving 
      immersive preceptorship and/or immersive training showed more accuracy and 
      confidence in administering the anesthesia. Participants perceived a high sense 
      of realism with the haptic feedback when handling the syringe. The machine 
      learning method was validated, with an accuracy of 84%, as a good classifier to 
      assess a student's needle insertion point performance. CONCLUSIONS: The immersive 
      VR simulator allows the practice of the inferior alveolar nerve block under near 
      real conditions and with immediate feedback to the dental student with respect to 
      the needle insertion point. This machine learning based automatic evaluation 
      provides a method to improve technical skills, contributing to dental training.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The incidence of cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction is 
      higher in patients with carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Based on the concept of 
      coprotection of heart and brain, this study attempts to screen the related 
      factors of early cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction after CEA with the 
      method of machine learning to provide clinical data for the prevention of 
      postoperative cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction. METHODS: 443 
      patients who received CEA operation under general anesthesia within 2 years were 
      collected as the research objects. The demographic data, previous medical 
      history, degree of neck vascular stenosis, blood pressure at all time points 
      during the perioperative period, the time of occlusion, whether to place the 
      shunt, and the time of hospital stay, whether to have cerebral infarction and 
      myocardial infarction were collected. The machine learning model was established, 
      and stable variables were selected based on single-factor analysis. RESULTS: The 
      incidence of cerebral infarction was 1.4% (6/443) and that of myocardial 
      infarction was 2.3% (10/443). The hospitalization time of patients with cerebral 
      infarction and myocardial infarction was longer than that of the control group (8 
      (7, 15) days vs. 7 (5, 8) days, P = 0.002). The stable related factors were 
      screened out by the xgboost model. The importance score (F score) was as follows: 
      average arterial pressure during occlusion was 222 points, body mass index was 
      159 points, average arterial pressure postoperation was 156 points, the standard 
      deviation of systolic pressure during occlusion was 153 points, diastolic 
      pressure during occlusion was 146 points, mean arterial pressure after entry was 
      143 points, systolic pressure during occlusion was 121 points, and age was 117 
      points. CONCLUSION: Eight factors, such as blood pressure, body mass index, and 
      age, may be related to the postoperative cerebral infarction and myocardial 
      infarction in patients with CEA. The machine learning method deserves further 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence-based guidelines are needed in the United States to improve 
      evaluation of perioperative allergic reactions including recommendations for 
      subsequent anesthesia. OBJECTIVE: To identify causative agent(s) and evaluate 
      patients' tolerability of subsequent anesthesia in patients evaluated by 
      Allergy/Immunology (A/I) at Massachusetts General Hospital. METHODS: We performed 
      a retrospective review of patients referred to the outpatient A/I clinic for 
      perioperative allergic reactions between October 2003 and May 2017. Patient 
      demographics, atopic history, and prior adverse drug reactions were reviewed. 
      Patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation with testing including skin testing 
      (ST), drug challenges (when appropriate), tryptase level measurement, and 
      specific IgE to latex measurement. Tolerance of subsequent procedures requiring 
      anesthesia was assessed. RESULTS: Of 123 patients referred, 74 (60%) were female 
      and the mean age was 46 (±18) years. At least 1 causative agent was identified in 
      28 patients (24%, n = 28 of 118). Seventeen of 28 (61%) patients were ST positive 
      to an antibiotic, including 13 (46%) positive to cefazolin; 3 patients (11%) had 
      a positive latex specific IgE. Of 85 patients who had subsequent anesthesia with 
      a known outcome, 78 (91%) did not have another perioperative allergic reaction. 
      Two of 5 patients with an elevated baseline tryptase level did not tolerate 
      subsequent anesthesia. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients safely received 
      subsequent anesthesia after comprehensive A/I evaluation for their perioperative 
      allergic reactions; however, improved algorithmic care is needed in the United 
      States. Among ST-positive patients (24%), antibiotics (especially cefazolin) were 
      the most common culprits. An elevated baseline tryptase level was associated with 
      an increased risk of recurrent perioperative allergic reactions.

AB  - Current pain assessment techniques based only on clinical evaluation and 
      self-reports are not objective and may lead to inadequate treatment. Having a 
      functional biomarker will add to the clinical fidelity, diagnosis, and perhaps 
      improve treatment efficacy in patients. While many approaches have been deployed 
      in pain biomarker discovery, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a 
      technology that allows for non-invasive measurement of cortical hemodynamics. The 
      utility of fNIRS is especially attractive given its ability to detect specific 
      changes in the somatosensory and high-order cortices as well as its ability to 
      measure (1) brain function similar to functional magnetic resonance imaging, (2) 
      graded responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli, (3) analgesia, and (4) 
      nociception under anesthesia. In this review, we evaluate the utility of fNIRS in 
      nociception/pain with particular focus on its sensitivity and specificity, 
      methodological advantages and limitations, and the current and potential 
      applications in various pain conditions. Everything considered, fNIRS technology 
      could enhance our ability to evaluate evoked and persistent pain across different 
      age groups and clinical populations.

TI  - A Review of the Important Role of CYP2D6 in Pharmacogenomics.
LID - 10.3390/genes11111295 [doi]
LID - 1295
AB  - Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a critical pharmacogene involved in the 
      metabolism of ~20% of commonly used drugs across a broad spectrum of medical 
      disciplines including psychiatry, pain management, oncology and cardiology. 
      Nevertheless, CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic with single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 
      small insertions/deletions and larger structural variants including 
      multiplications, deletions, tandem arrangements, and hybridisations with 
      non-functional CYP2D7 pseudogenes. The frequency of these variants differs across 
      populations, and they significantly influence the drug-metabolising enzymatic 
      function of CYP2D6. Importantly, altered CYP2D6 function has been associated with 
      both adverse drug reactions and reduced drug efficacy, and there is growing 
      recognition of the clinical and economic burdens associated with suboptimal drug 
      utilisation. To date, pharmacogenomic clinical guidelines for at least 48 
      CYP2D6-substrate drugs have been developed by prominent pharmacogenomics 
      societies, which contain therapeutic recommendations based on CYP2D6-predicted 
      categories of metaboliser phenotype. Novel algorithms to interpret CYP2D6 
      function from sequencing data that consider structural variants, and machine 
      learning approaches to characterise the functional impact of novel variants, are 
      being developed. However, CYP2D6 genotyping is yet to be implemented broadly into 
      clinical practice, and so further effort and initiatives are required to overcome 
      the implementation challenges and deliver the potential benefits to the bedside.

TI  - Deep-learning-based real-time prediction of acute kidney injury outperforms human 
      predictive performance.
PG  - 139
LID - 10.1038/s41746-020-00346-8 [doi]
LID - 139
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication after cardiothoracic surgery. 
      Early prediction of AKI could prompt preventive measures, but is challenging in 
      the clinical routine. One important reason is that the amount of postoperative 
      data is too massive and too high-dimensional to be effectively processed by the 
      human operator. We therefore sought to develop a deep-learning-based algorithm 
      that is able to predict postoperative AKI prior to the onset of symptoms and 
      complications. Based on 96 routinely collected parameters we built a recurrent 
      neural network (RNN) for real-time prediction of AKI after cardiothoracic 
      surgery. From the data of 15,564 admissions we constructed a balanced training 
      set (2224 admissions) for the development of the RNN. The model was then 
      evaluated on an independent test set (350 admissions) and yielded an area under 
      curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval) of 0.893 (0.862-0.924). We compared the 
      performance of our model against that of experienced clinicians. The RNN 
      significantly outperformed clinicians (AUC = 0.901 vs. 0.745, p < 0.001) and was 
      overall well calibrated. This was not the case for the physicians, who 
      systematically underestimated the risk (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the RNN was 
      superior to physicians in the prediction of AKI after cardiothoracic surgery. It 
      could potentially be integrated into hospitals' electronic health records for 
      real-time patient monitoring and may help to detect early AKI and hence modify 
      the treatment in perioperative care.

TI  - State-Dependent Cortical Unit Activity Reflects Dynamic Brain State Transitions 
      in Anesthesia.
PG  - 9440-9454
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0601-20.2020 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the effects of anesthesia on cortical neuronal spiking and 
      information transfer could help illuminate the neuronal basis of the conscious 
      state. Recent investigations suggest that the brain state identified by local 
      field potential spectrum is not stationary but changes spontaneously at a fixed 
      level of anesthetic concentration. How cortical unit activity changes with 
      dynamically transitioning brain states under anesthesia is unclear. Extracellular 
      unit activity was measured with 64-channel silicon microelectrode arrays in 
      cortical layers 5/6 of the primary visual cortex of chronically instrumented, 
      freely moving male rats (n = 7) during stepwise reduction of the anesthetic 
      desflurane (6%, 4%, 2%, and 0%). Unsupervised machine learning applied to 
      multiunit spike patterns revealed five distinct brain states. A novel 
      desynchronized brain state with increased spike rate variability, sample entropy, 
      and EMG activity occurred in 6% desflurane with 40.0% frequency. The other four 
      brain states reflected graded levels of anesthesia. As anesthesia deepened the 
      spike rate of neurons decreased regardless of their spike rate profile at 
      baseline conscious state. Actively firing neurons with wide-spiking pattern 
      showed increased bursting activity along with increased spike timing variability, 
      unit-to-population correlation, and unit-to-unit transfer entropy, despite the 
      overall decrease in transfer entropy. The narrow-spiking neurons showed similar 
      changes but to a lesser degree. These results suggest that (1) anesthetic effect 
      on spike rate is distinct from sleep, (2) synchronously fragmented spiking 
      pattern is a signature of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, and (3) the 
      paradoxical, desynchronized brain state in deep anesthesia contends the generally 
      presumed monotonic, dose-dependent anesthetic effect on the brain.SIGNIFICANCE 
      STATEMENT Recent studies suggest that spontaneous changes in brain state occur 
      under anesthesia. However, the spiking behavior of cortical neurons associated 
      with such state changes has not been investigated. We found that local brain 
      states defined by multiunit activity had a nonunitary relationship with the 
      current anesthetic level. A paradoxical brain state displaying asynchronous 
      firing pattern and high EMG activity was found unexpectedly in deep anesthesia. 
      In contrast, the synchronous fragmentation of neuronal spiking appeared to be a 
      robust signature of the state of anesthesia. The findings challenge the 
      assumption of monotonic, anesthetic dose-dependent behavior of cortical neuron 
      populations. They enhance the interpretation of neuroscientific data obtained 
      under anesthesia and the understanding of the neuronal basis of 
      anesthetic-induced state of unconsciousness.

TI  - Automated Smart Home Assessment to Support Pain Management: Multiple Methods 
      Analysis.
PG  - e23943
LID - 10.2196/23943 [doi]
LID - e23943
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poorly managed pain can lead to substance use disorders, depression, 
      suicide, worsening health, and increased use of health services. Most pain 
      assessments occur in clinical settings away from patients' natural environments. 
      Advances in smart home technology may allow observation of pain in the home 
      setting. Smart homes recognizing human behaviors may be useful for quantifying 
      functional pain interference, thereby creating new ways of assessing pain and 
      supporting people living with pain. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if a 
      smart home can detect pain-related behaviors to perform automated assessment and 
      support intervention for persons with chronic pain. METHODS: A multiple methods, 
      secondary data analysis was conducted using historic ambient sensor data and 
      weekly nursing assessment data from 11 independent older adults reporting pain 
      across 1-2 years of smart home monitoring. A qualitative approach was used to 
      interpret sensor-based data of 27 unique pain events to support clinician-guided 
      training of a machine learning model. A periodogram was used to calculate 
      circadian rhythm strength, and a random forest containing 100 trees was employed 
      to train a machine learning model to recognize pain-related behaviors. The model 
      extracted 550 behavioral markers for each sensor-based data segment. These were 
      treated as both a binary classification problem (event, control) and a regression 
      problem. RESULTS: We found 13 clinically relevant behaviors, revealing 6 
      pain-related behavioral qualitative themes. Quantitative results were classified 
      using a clinician-guided random forest technique that yielded a classification 
      accuracy of 0.70, sensitivity of 0.72, specificity of 0.69, area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.756, and area under the 
      precision-recall curve of 0.777 in comparison to using standard anomaly detection 
      techniques without clinician guidance (0.16 accuracy achieved; P<.001). The 
      regression formulation achieved moderate correlation, with r=0.42. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Findings of this secondary data analysis reveal that a pain-assessing smart home 
      may recognize pain-related behaviors. Utilizing clinicians' real-world knowledge 
      when developing pain-assessing machine learning models improves the model's 
      performance. A larger study focusing on pain-related behaviors is warranted to 
      improve and test model performance.

TI  - The Use and Concurrent Use of Side Effect Controlling Medications Among Women on 
      Aromatase Inhibitors.
PG  - 131-136
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2020.8493 [doi]
AB  - Background: Women on aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as part of their breast cancer 
      treatment often experience difficult to control side effects. Although there are 
      several medications to manage the side effects of AI therapy, many of them are 
      associated with their own risk, particularly sedation. The objective of this 
      study was to describe the prescribing practices for side effect managing (SE) 
      medications among women with breast cancer on AI therapy and to assess for 
      combinations of medications that may present a clinical risk to patients. 
      Methods: Retrospective data analysis using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End 
      Results (SEER)-Medicare data of all women aged 66-90 years with stage I-III 
      hormone positive breast cancer diagnosed between 2008 and 2014 who initiated AI 
      therapy within 12 months of their diagnosis. We determined the percentage of 
      patients prescribed an SE medication in the 12 months prior and in the 24 months 
      after the initiation of AI therapy. We calculated the number of prescriptions and 
      the number of days of overlapping (i.e., >1 SE) prescriptions, and examined 
      predictors of overlapping prescriptions. Results: The use of SE medications was 
      pervasive and increased after initiation of AI therapy. The most commonly 
      prescribed medications were opiates (55.1%), selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (22.6%), benzodiazepines (18.4%), tramadol (17.7%) and gabapentin 
      (14.6%). In total 15.5% of patients had overlapping prescriptions; among those, 
      36.2% had three overlapping prescriptions. Prior use was the strongest predictor 
      of overlapping prescriptions with an odds ratio of 7.9 (95% confidence interval: 
      7.17-8.77). Conclusion: Among women on AI therapy, the use of SE medications is 
      common and many have overlapping prescriptions raising concern for potential harm 
      from polypharmacy.

TI  - 'Black Box' to 'Conversational' Machine Learning: Ondansetron Reduces Risk of 
      Hospital-Acquired Venous Thromboembolism.
PG  - 2204-2214
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.3033405 [doi]
AB  - Machine learning, combined with a proliferation of electronic healthcare records 
      (EHR), has the potential to transform medicine by identifying previously unknown 
      interventions that reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. To realize this 
      potential, machine learning must leave the conceptual 'black box' in complex 
      domains to overcome several pitfalls, like the presence of confounding variables. 
      These variables predict outcomes but are not causal, often yielding uninformative 
      models. In this work, we envision a 'conversational' approach to design machine 
      learning models, which couple modeling decisions to domain expertise. We 
      demonstrate this approach via a retrospective cohort study to identify factors 
      which affect the risk of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (HA-VTE). Using 
      logistic regression for modeling, we have identified drugs that reduce the risk 
      of HA-VTE. Our analysis reveals that ondansetron, an anti-nausea and anti-emetic 
      medication, commonly used in treating side-effects of chemotherapy and 
      post-general anesthesia period, substantially reduces the risk of HA-VTE when 
      compared to aspirin (11% vs. 15% relative risk reduction or RRR, respectively). 
      The low cost and low morbidity of ondansetron may justify further inquiry into 
      its use as a preventative agent for HA-VTE. This case study highlights the 
      importance of engaging domain expertise while applying machine learning in 
      complex domains.

      intracranial pressure with machine learning.
PG  - e0240845
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0240845 [doi]
LID - e0240845
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeated invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is desirable 
      because many neurosurgical pathologies are associated with elevated ICP. On the 
      other hand, it could become a risk for children to repeat sedation, anesthesia, 
      or radiation exposure. As a non-invasive method, measurements of optic nerve 
      sheath diameter (ONSD) has been revealed to accurately predict increased ICP. 
      However, no studies have indicated a relationship among age, brain, and 
      ventricular parameters in normal children, nor a prediction of increased ICP with 
      artificial intelligence. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study enrolled 400 normal 
      children for control and 75 children with signs of increased ICP between 2009 and 
      2019. Measurements of the parameters including ONSD on CT were obtained. A 
      supervised machine learning was applied to predict suspected increased ICP based 
      on CT measurements. A linear correlation was shown between ln(age) and mean ONSD 
      (mONSD) in normal children, revealing mONSD = 0.36ln(age)+2.26 (R2 = 0.60). This 
      study revealed a linear correlation of mONSD measured on CT with ln(age) and the 
      width of the brain, not the width of the ventricles in 400 normal children based 
      on the univariate analyses. Additionally, the multivariate analyses revealed 
      minimum bicaudate nuclei distance was also associated with mONSD. The results of 
      the group comparison between control and suspected increased ICP revealed a 
      statistical significance in mONSD and the width of the ventricles. The study 
      indicated that supervised machine learning application could be applied to 
      predict suspected increased ICP in children, with an accuracy of 94% for 
      training, 91% for test. CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified three issues regarding 
      ONSD and ICP. Mean ONSD measured on CT was correlated with ln(age) and the width 
      of the brain, not the width of the ventricles in 400 normal children based on the 
      univariate analyses. The multivariate analyses revealed minimum bicaudate nuclei 
      distance was also associated with mONSD. Mean ONSD and the width of ventricles 
      were statistically significant in children with signs of elevated ICP. Finally, 
      the study showed that machine learning could be used to predict children with 
      suspected increased ICP.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The opioid epidemic has altered normative clinical perceptions on 
      addressing both acute and chronic pain, particularly within the Emergency 
      Department (ED) setting, where providers are now confronted with balancing pain 
      management and potential abuse. This study aims to examine patient 
      sociodemographic and ED clinical characteristics to comprehensively determine 
      predictors of opioid administration during an ED visit (ED-RX) and prescribing 
      upon discharge (DC-RX). METHODS: ED visit data of patients ≥18 years old from the 
      National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2014 to 2017 were 
      used. Opioid prescriptions were determined utilizing Lexicon narcotic drug 
      classifications. Visit characteristics studied included sociodemographic 
      variables, and ED clinical variables, such as chief complaint, and discharge 
      diagnosis. Machine learning methods were used to determine predictors of ED-RX 
      and DC-RX and weighted logistic regressions were performed using selected 
      predictors. RESULTS: Of the 44,227 ED visits identified, patients tended to be 
      female (57.4%), and White (74.2%) with an average age of 46.4 years (SE = 0.3). 
      Weighted proportions of ED-RX and DC-RX were 23.2% and 18.9%, respectively. The 
      strongest predictors of ED-RX were CT scan ordered (OR = 2.18, 95% 
      CI = 1.84-2.58), abdominal pain (OR = 1.93, 95% CI:1.59-2.34) and back pain 
      (OR = 1.81, 95% CI:1.45-2.27). Tooth pain (OR = 6.94, 95% CI = 4.40-10.94) and 
      fracture injury diagnoses (OR = 3.76, 95% CI = 2.72-5.19) were the strongest 
      predictors of DC-RX. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the utility of 
      machine learning for understanding clinical predictors of opioid administration 
      and prescribing in the ED, and its potential in informing standardized 
      prescribing recommendations and guidelines.

TI  - The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Elements that Most Greatly Impact 
      Length of Stay and Readmission.
PG  - 473-479
LID - 10.1177/0003134820951440 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have been shown to 
      decrease length of stay (LOS) and improve patient outcomes in a wide variety of 
      surgical fields; however, barriers exist preventing the implementation of all 
      elements. We hypothesize that a subset of ERAS elements are most influential on 
      LOS and readmission following colorectal surgery. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective 
      review of 840 patients was performed and their compliance with 24 ERAS components 
      evaluated. Two independent machine-learning statistical algorithms were employed 
      to determine which subset of ERAS elements was most impactful on LOS <3 days and 
      hospital readmission. RESULTS: Increasing compliance with ERAS elements had an 
      inverse linear relationship with LOS. Open (vs minimally invasive) surgery was 
      associated with increased LOS. Early mobilization and multimodal pain management 
      are the elements most protective against increased LOS. Readmissions increase 
      with the number of morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day. The subset of 
      patients who underwent minimally invasive procedures, had multimodal pain 
      control, and less than 16 MME per day were least likely (23%) to have >3-day LOS. 
      Those patients who underwent an open procedure with less than 15 ERAS elements 
      completed were most likely (84%) to have >3-day LOS. CONCLUSION: While increasing 
      compliance with ERAS protocols and minimally invasive procedures decrease LOS and 
      readmission overall, a subset of components-multimodal pain control, limited 
      opioid use, and early mobilization-was most associated with decreased LOS and 
      readmission. This study provides guidance on which ERAS elements should be 
      emphasized.

TI  - Machine learning can reliably identify patients at risk of overnight hospital 
      admission following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PG  - 2958-2966
LID - 10.1007/s00167-020-06321-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Overnight admission following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction 
      has implications on clinical outcomes as well as cost benefit, yet there are few 
      validated risk calculators for reliable identification of appropriate candidates. 
      The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a machine learning algorithm 
      that can effectively identify patients requiring admission following elective 
      anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. METHODS: A retrospective review 
      of a national surgical outcomes database was performed to identify patients who 
      underwent elective ACL reconstruction from 2006 to 2018. Patients admitted 
      overnight postoperatively were identified as those with length of stay of 1 or 
      more days. Models were generated using random forest (RF), extreme gradient 
      boosting (XGBoost), linear discriminant classifier (LDA), and adaptive boosting 
      algorithms (AdaBoost), and an additional model was produced as a weighted 
      ensemble of the four final algorithms. RESULTS: Overall, of the 4,709 patients 
      included, 531 patients (11.3%) required at least one overnight stay following ACL 
      reconstruction. The factors determined most important for identification of 
      candidates for inpatient admission were operative time, anesthesia type, age, 
      gender, and BMI. Smoking history, history of COPD, and history of coagulopathy 
      were identified as less important variables. The following factors supported 
      overnight admission: operative time > 200 min, age < 35.8 or > 53.5 years, male 
      gender, BMI < 25 or > 31.2 kg/m(2), positive smoking history, history of COPD and 
      the presence of preoperative coagulopathy. The ensemble model achieved the best 
      performance based on discrimination assessed via internal validation 
      (AUC = 0.76), calibration, and decision curve analysis. The model was integrated 
      into a web-based open-access application able to provide both predictions and 
      explanations. CONCLUSION: Modifiable risk factors identified by the model such as 
      increased BMI, operative time, anesthesia type, and comorbidities can help 
      clinicians optimize preoperative status to prevent costs associated with 
      unnecessary admissions. If externally validated in independent populations, this 
      algorithm could use these inputs to guide preoperative screening and risk 
      stratification to identify patients requiring overnight admission for observation 
      following ACL reconstruction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

TI  - Is a Fundamental Design Change for Gastrointestinal Endoscopes Required?
PG  - 21-24
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000001430 [doi]
AB  - Since the first fiberoptic instruments, gastrointestinal endoscopy has shaped the 
      field of gastroenterology and is now a key diagnostic and therapeutic tool. 
      Compared with the initial fiberoptic endoscopes state-of-the-art optical chips 
      (or charge-coupled device technology) allowed a quantum leap in image quality. 
      Despite these advances, gastrointestinal endoscopy is far from being perfect. The 
      diagnostic yield (eg, for adenoma detection rates) is highly operator dependent 
      and there is still the need for sedation or even anesthesia to address discomfort 
      during the procedure. Despite highly standardized cleaning and high-level 
      disinfection the reuse of contemporary (and difficult to clean) endoscopes with 
      multiple channels exposes patients to the risk of transmission of infections. 
      Artificial intelligence and pattern recognition should eliminate interindividual 
      variability including polyp detection rates, self-propelled, and (potentially 
      remotely controlled) scopes with a soft shaft could reduce the discomfort during 
      procedures and abolish the need for sedation and anesthesia altogether and 
      single-use designs should eliminate the risk of patient-to-patient transmission 
      of infections. While these innovations are feasible and could be implemented 
      rapidly utilizing available technology, they require a paradigm shift affecting 
      all levels of the value chain from the supplier of the instruments to the 
      end-users. Some may negate the need for a paradigm shift, but it is evident that 
      a major redesign of the endoscopic equipment is overdue to fully utilize novel 
      technologies and most importantly ensure the best possible outcomes for patients.

PG  - 5838-5841
LID - 10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175599 [doi]
AB  - Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder of red blood cells in humans. 
      Complications such as pain, stroke, and organ failure occur in SCD as malformed, 
      sickled red blood cells passing through small blood vessels get trapped. 
      Particularly, acute pain is known to be the primary symptom of SCD. The insidious 
      and subjective nature of SCD pain leads to challenges in pain assessment among 
      Medical Practitioners (MPs). Thus, accurate identification of markers of pain in 
      patients with SCD is crucial for pain management. Classifying clinical notes of 
      patients with SCD based on their pain level enables MPs to give appropriate 
      treatment. We propose a binary classification model to predict pain relevance of 
      clinical notes and a multiclass classification model to predict pain level. While 
      our four binary machine learning (ML) classifiers are comparable in their 
      performance, Decision Trees had the best performance for the multiclass 
      classification task achieving 0.70 in F-measure. Our results show the potential 
      clinical text analysis and machine learning offer to pain management in sickle 
      cell patients.

AB  - Effective pain management can significantly improve quality of life and outcomes 
      for various types of patients (e.g. elderly, adult, young) and often requires 
      assisted living for a significant number of people worldwide. In order to improve 
      our understanding of patients' response to pain and needs for assisted living we 
      need to develop adequate data processing techniques that would enable us to 
      understand underlying interdependencies. To this purpose in this paper we develop 
      several different algorithms that can predict the need for medically assisted 
      living outcomes using a large database obtained as a part of the national health 
      survey. As a part of the survey the respondents provided detailed information 
      about general health care state, acute and chronic problems as well as personal 
      perception of pain associated with performing two simple talks: walking on the 
      flat surface and walking upstairs. We model the correspondent responses using 
      multinomial random variables and propose structured deep learning models based on 
      maximum likelihood estimation and machine learning for information fusion. For 
      comparison purposes we also implement fully connected deep learning network and 
      use its results as benchmark measurements. We evaluate the performance of the 
      proposed techniques using the national survey data and split them into two parts 
      used for training and testing. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed 
      models can potentially be useful in forecasting the need for medically assisted 
      living.

PG  - 4526-4529

AB  - We developed an objective real-time pain detection method using a smartphone and 
      a wrist-worn wearable device to collect electrodermal activity (EDA) signals. 
      Recently, various researchers have developed pain management applications. 
      However, they rely on subjective self-reported pain scores or the video camera of 
      a smartphone to detect pain, but the latter method's accuracy needs further 
      improvement. In our work, we use a wrist-worn EDA device which transmits data via 
      Bluetooth to a smartphone. A smartphone application was developed to analyze the 
      EDA data so that near real-time processed pain detection information can be 
      displayed. The analysis of EDA is based on estimating time-varying spectral power 
      in the frequency range (0.08-0.24 Hz) associated with the sympathetic nervous 
      system. This time-varying characterization of EDA is termed TVSymp. In this work, 
      we also examined whether removing baseline EDA fluctuations from TVSymp would 
      provide more accurate results. This was carried out by taking the moving average 
      of the EDA response prior to stimulus and subtracting that value from the EDA 
      response post stimulus. This approach is termed modified TVSymp (MTVSymp). Pain 
      stimuli were induced in ten subjects using a thermal grill, which gives intense 
      pain perception without damaging skin tissues. We compared both TVSymp and 
      MTVSymp in detecting pain induced by the thermal grill using machine learning 
      approaches. We found the accuracy of pain detection of TVSymp and MTVSymp to be 
      80% and 90%, respectively.

TI  - Deep Learning Techniques to Improve Intraoperative Awareness Detection from 
      Electroencephalographic Signals.
PG  - 142-145
LID - 10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176228 [doi]
AB  - Every year, millions of patients regain conscious- ness during surgery and can 
      potentially suffer from post-traumatic disorders. We recently showed that the 
      detection of motor activity during a median nerve stimulation from 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) signals could be used to alert the medical staff 
      that a patient is waking up and trying to move under general anesthesia [1], [2]. 
      In this work, we measure the accuracy and false positive rate in detecting motor 
      imagery of several deep learning models (EEGNet, deep convolutional network and 
      shallow convolutional network) directly trained on filtered EEG data. We compare 
      them with efficient non-deep approaches, namely, a linear discriminant analysis 
      based on common spatial patterns, the minimum distance to Riemannian mean 
      algorithm applied to covariance matrices, a logistic regression based on a 
      tangent space projection of covariance matrices (TS+LR). The EEGNet improves 
      significantly the classification performance comparing to other classifiers (p- 
      value <; 0.01); moreover it outperforms the best non-deep classifier (TS+LR) for 
      7.2% of accuracy. This approach promises to improve intraoperative awareness 
      detection during general anesthesia.

TI  - Generalized Prediction of Unconsciousness during Propofol Anesthesia using 3D 
      Convolutional Neural Networks.
PG  - 134-137
LID - 10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175324 [doi]
AB  - Neuroscience has generated a number of recent advances in the search for the 
      neural correlates of consciousness, but these have yet to find valuable 
      real-world applications. Electroencephalography under anesthesia provides a 
      powerful experimental setup to identify electrophysiological signatures of 
      altered states of consciousness, as well as a testbed for developing systems for 
      automatic diagnosis and prognosis of awareness in clinical settings. In this 
      work, we use deep convolutional neural networks to automatically differentiate 
      sub-anesthetic states and depths of anesthesia, solely from one second of raw EEG 
      signal. Our results with leave-one-participant-out-cross-validation show that 
      behavioral measures, such as the Ramsay score, can be used to learn generalizable 
      neural networks that reliably predict levels of unconsciousness in unseen 
      transitional anesthetic states, as well as in unseen experimental setups and 
      behaviors. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning to detect 
      progressive changes in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness with higher granularity 
      than behavioral or pharmacological markers. This work has broader significance 
      for identifying generalized patterns of brain activity that index states of 
      consciousness.Clinical Relevance- In the United States alone, over 100,000 people 
      receive general anesthesia every day, from which up to 1% is affected by 
      unintended intraoperative awareness [1]. Despite this, brain-based monitoring of 
      consciousness is not common in the clinic, and has had mixed success [2]. Given 
      this context, our aim is to develop and explore an automated deep learning model 
      that accurately predicts and interprets the depth and quality of anesthesia from 
      the raw EEG signal.

TI  - Enhancement of needle visualization and localization in ultrasound.
PG  - 169-178
LID - 10.1007/s11548-020-02227-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This scoping review covers needle visualization and localization 
      techniques in ultrasound, where localization-based approaches mostly aim to 
      compute the needle shaft (and tip) location while potentially enhancing its 
      visibility too. METHODS: A literature review is conducted on the state-of-the-art 
      techniques, which could be divided into five categories: (1) signal and image 
      processing-based techniques to augment the needle, (2) modifications to the 
      needle and insertion to help with needle-transducer alignment and visibility, (3) 
      changes to ultrasound image formation, (4) motion-based analysis and (5) machine 
      learning. RESULTS: Advantages, limitations and challenges of representative 
      examples in each of the categories are discussed. Evaluation techniques performed 
      in ex vivo, phantom and in vivo studies are discussed and summarized. CONCLUSION: 
      Greatest limitation of the majority of the literature is that they rely on 
      original visibility of the needle in the static image. Need for 
      additional/improved apparatus is the greatest limitation toward clinical utility 
      in practice. SIGNIFICANCE: Ultrasound-guided needle placement is performed in 
      many clinical applications, including biopsies, treatment injections and 
      anesthesia. Despite the wide range and long history of this technique, an ongoing 
      challenge is needle visibility in ultrasound. A robust technique to enhance 
      ultrasonic needle visibility, especially for steeply inserted hand-held needles, 
      and while maintaining clinical utility requirements is needed.

AB  - Echocardiography is a unique diagnostic tool for intraoperative monitoring and 
      assessment of patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, there are high 
      levels of interoperator variations in echocardiography interpretations that could 
      lead to inaccurate diagnosis and incorrect treatment. Furthermore, 
      anesthesiologists are faced with the additional challenge to interpret 
      echocardiography and make decisions in a limited timeframe from these complex 
      data. The need for an automated, less operator-dependent process that enhances 
      speed and accuracy of echocardiography analysis is crucial for anesthesiologists. 
      Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in the medical 
      field and could help anesthesiologists analyze complex echocardiographic data 
      while adding increased accuracy and consistency to interpretation. This review 
      aims to summarize practical use of artificial intelligence in echocardiography 
      and discusses potential limitations and challenges in the future for 
      anesthesiologists.

TI  - A web-based machine-learning algorithm predicting postoperative acute kidney 
      injury after total knee arthroplasty.
PG  - 545-554

AB  - PURPOSE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a deleterious complication after total knee 
      arthroplasty (TKA). The purposes of this study were to identify preoperative risk 
      factors and develop a web-based prediction model for postoperative AKI, and 
      assess how AKI affected the progression to ESRD. METHOD: The study included 5757 
      patients treated in three tertiary teaching hospitals. The model was developed 
      using data on 5302 patients from two hospitals and externally validated in 455 
      patients from the third hospital. Eighteen preoperative variables were collected 
      and feature selection was performed. A gradient boosting machine (GBM) was used 
      to predict AKI. A tenfold-stratified area under the curve (AUC) served as the 
      metric for internal validation. Calibration was performed via isotonic regression 
      and evaluated using a calibration plot. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) was 
      followed up for an average of 41.7 months. RESULTS: AKI develops in up to 10% of 
      patients undergoing TKA, increasing the risk of progression to ESRD. The ESRD 
      odds ratio of AKI patients (compared to non-AKI patients) was 9.8 (95% confidence 
      interval 4.3-22.4). Six key predictors of postoperative AKI were selected: higher 
      preoperative levels of creatinine in serum, the use of general anesthesia, male 
      sex, a higher ASA class (> 3), use of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
      inhibitor, and no use of tranexamic acid (all p < 0.001). The predictive 
      performance of our model was good (area under the curve 0.78 [95% CI 0.74-0.81] 
      in the developmental cohort and improved in the external validation cohort 
      (0.89). Our model can be accessed at https://safetka.net . CONCLUSIONS: A 
      web-based predictive model for AKI after TKA was developed using a 
      machine-learning algorithm featuring six preoperative variables. The model is 
      simple and has been validated to improve both short- and long-term prognoses of 
      TKA patients. Postoperative AKI may lead to ESRD, which surgeons should strive to 
      avoid. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic level II.

TI  - Effects of pain, sedation and delirium monitoring on clinical and economic 
      outcome: A retrospective study.
PG  - e0234801
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0234801 [doi]
LID - e0234801
AB  - BACKGROUND: Significant improvements in clinical outcome can be achieved by 
      implementing effective strategies to optimise pain management, reduce sedative 
      exposure, and prevent and treat delirium in ICU patients. One important strategy 
      is the monitoring of pain, agitation and delirium (PAD bundle). We hypothesised 
      that there is no sufficient financial benefit to implement a monitoring strategy 
      in a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)-based reimbursement system, therefore we 
      expected better clinical and decreased economic outcome for monitored patients. 
      METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study using routinely collected 
      data. We used univariate and multiple linear analysis, machine-learning analysis 
      and a novel correlation statistic (maximal information coefficient) to explore 
      the association between monitoring adherence and resulting clinical and economic 
      outcome. For univariate analysis we split patients in an adherence achieved and 
      an adherence non-achieved group. RESULTS: In total 1,323 adult patients from two 
      campuses of a German tertiary medical centre, who spent at least one day in the 
      ICU between admission and discharge between 1. January 2016 and 31. December 
      2016. Adherence to PAD monitoring was associated with shorter hospital LoS (e.g. 
      pain monitoring 13 vs. 10 days; p<0.001), ICU LoS, duration of mechanical 
      ventilation shown by univariate analysis. Despite the improved clinical outcome, 
      adherence to PAD elements was associated with a decreased case mix per day and 
      profit per day shown by univariate analysis. Multiple linear analysis did not 
      confirm these results. PAD monitoring is important for clinical as well as 
      economic outcome and predicted case mix better than severity of illness shown by 
      machine learning analysis. CONCLUSION: Adherence to PAD bundles is also important 
      for clinical as well as economic outcome. It is associated with improved clinical 
      and worse economic outcome in comparison to non-adherence in univariate analysis 
      but not confirmed by multiple linear analysis. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation mimics non-rapid eye movement stage 3 
      sleep: large-scale validation using machine learning.

LID - zsaa167
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Dexmedetomidine-induced electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns 
      during deep sedation are comparable with natural sleep patterns. Using 
      large-scale EEG recordings and machine learning techniques, we investigated 
      whether dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation indeed mimics natural sleep 
      patterns. METHODS: We used EEG recordings from three sources in this study: 8,707 
      overnight sleep EEG and 30 dexmedetomidine clinical trial EEG. 
      Dexmedetomidine-induced sedation levels were assessed using the Modified 
      Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score. We extracted 22 
      spectral features from each EEG recording using a multitaper spectral estimation 
      method. Elastic-net regularization method was used for feature selection. We 
      compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms (logistic 
      regression, support vector machine, and random forest), trained on individual 
      sleep stages, to predict different levels of the MOAA/S sedation state. RESULTS: 
      The random forest algorithm trained on non-rapid eye movement stage 3 (N3) 
      predicted dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation (MOAA/S = 0) with area under the 
      receiver operator characteristics curve >0.8 outperforming other machine learning 
      models. Power in the delta band (0-4 Hz) was selected as an important feature for 
      prediction in addition to power in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (16-30 Hz) bands. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Using a large-scale EEG data-driven approach and machine learning 
      framework, we show that dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation state mimics N3 
      sleep EEG patterns. CLINICAL TRIALS: Name-Pharmacodynamic Interaction of REMI and

      detect awareness under anesthesia.

AB  - Spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and auditory evoked potentials (AEP) have 
      been suggested to monitor the level of consciousness during anesthesia. As both 
      signals reflect different neuronal pathways, a combination of parameters from 
      both signals may provide broader information about the brain status during 
      anesthesia. Appropriate parameter selection and combination to a single index is 
      crucial to take advantage of this potential. The field of machine learning offers 
      algorithms for both parameter selection and combination. In this study, several 
      established machine learning approaches including a method for the selection of 
      suitable signal parameters and classification algorithms are applied to construct 
      an index which predicts responsiveness in anesthetized patients. The present 
      analysis considers several classification algorithms, among those support vector 
      machines, artificial neural networks and Bayesian learning algorithms. On the 
      basis of data from the transition between consciousness and unconsciousness, a 
      combination of EEG and AEP signal parameters developed with automated methods 
      provides a maximum prediction probability of 0.935, which is higher than 0.916 
      (for EEG parameters) and 0.880 (for AEP parameters) using a cross-validation 
      approach. This suggests that machine learning techniques can successfully be 
      applied to develop an improved combined EEG and AEP parameter to separate 
      consciousness from unconsciousness.

TI  - Comparative Analysis on Machine Learning and Deep Learning to Predict 
      Post-Induction Hypotension.

LID - 4575
AB  - Hypotensive events in the initial stage of anesthesia can cause serious 
      complications in the patients after surgery, which could be fatal. In this study, 
      we intended to predict hypotension after tracheal intubation using machine 
      learning and deep learning techniques after intubation one minute in advance. 
      Meta learning models, such as random forest, extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), 
      and deep learning models, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN) model 
      and the deep neural network (DNN), were trained to predict hypotension occurring 
      between tracheal intubation and incision, using data from four minutes to one 
      minute before tracheal intubation. Vital records and electronic health records 
      (EHR) for 282 of 319 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy from 
      October 2018 to July 2019 were collected. Among the 282 patients, 151 developed 
      post-induction hypotension. Our experiments had two scenarios: using raw vital 
      records and feature engineering on vital records. The experiments on raw data 
      showed that CNN had the best accuracy of 72.63%, followed by random forest 
      (70.32%) and Xgboost (64.6%). The experiments on feature engineering showed that 
      random forest combined with feature selection had the best accuracy of 74.89%, 
      while CNN had a lower accuracy of 68.95% than that of the experiment on raw data. 
      Our study is an extension of previous studies to detect hypotension before 
      intubation with a one-minute advance. To improve accuracy, we built a model using 
      state-of-art algorithms. We found that CNN had a good performance, but that 
      random forest had a better performance when combined with feature selection. In 
      addition, we found that the examination period (data period) is also important.

TI  - Interventional pain management in patients with cancer-related pain.
PG  - 13-16
LID - 10.1080/00325481.2020.1807796 [doi]
AB  - Invasive interventional procedures for managing pain in cancer patients are often 
      underutilized following the popularization of the WHO analgesic ladder. The 
      procedures that were successfully used until then were relegated away from 
      mainstream palliative care practice, with the advent of newer opioids and 
      adjuvants. Even though nerve blocks, intrathecal pumps and spinal cord 
      stimulation were reintroduced as the fourth step of the WHO ladder, often 
      referrals for these procedures are too late to produce a meaningful effect on 
      quality of life. At this point most patients have advanced disease and are 
      requiring end of life care. Additionally, it is becoming evident that at least 
      10% of patients do not achieve good quality analgesia with oral opioids and are 
      often troubled by unacceptable side effects. There is an increasing public 
      awareness of the problems with long-term opioid therapy and some of these 
      patients would certainly benefit from invasive procedures to alleviate their pain 
      and improve their quality of life. Improving life quality and expectancy with 
      better treatment options and increasing number of cancer survivors should be 
      heralding a change and hence neurolytic procedures are to be used only in 
      patients with limited life expectancy. ITDDs, neuromodulation and ever-increasing 
      use of procedures routinely used in treating chronic nonmalignant pain would be 
      the mainstay of interventional management until AI and nanotechnology would open 
      doors for novel treatment options. Interventions should not be used as a last 
      resort after multiple failed attempts at opioid therapy, but as an integral part 
      of a management strategy including medical management, psychological and 
      emotional welfare, and supportive care of the patient in a holistic manner. The 
      curriculum of specialists should include appropriate training to safely perform 
      and produce better quality evidence to validate the efficacy and safety of these 
      challenging procedures.

AB  - There is a critical need for reliable quantitative biomarkers to assess 
      functional brain alterations in mouse models of neuropsychiatric diseases, but 
      current imaging methods measuring drug effects through the neurovascular 
      coupling, face issues including poor sensitivity, drug-induced changes in global 
      brain perfusion and the effects of anesthesia. Here we demonstrate the 
      proof-of-concept of a minimally-invasive fUS imaging approach to detect the acute 
      cholinergic modulatory effects of Scopolamine (ScoP) on functional brain 
      connectivity in awake and behaving mice, through the intact skull. A 
      machine-learning algorithm constructed an ad-hoc pharmacological score from the 
      ScoP-induced changes in connectivity patterns of five mice. The discrimination 
      model shows important ScoP-induced increase of the hippocampo-cortical 
      connectivity. The pharmacological score led to robust discrimination of ScoP 
      treatment from baseline in an independent dataset and showed, in another 
      independent group, dose-dependent specific effects of central cholinergic 
      modulation of functional connectivity, independent from global brain perfusion 
      changes. In conclusion, we introduce pharmaco-fUS as a simple, robust, specific 
      and sensitive modality to monitor drug effects on perfusion and functional 
      connectivity in the awake mouse brain.

      Data.

AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a red blood cell disorder complicated by lifelong 
      issues with pain. Management of SCD related pain is particularly challenging due 
      to its subjective nature. Hence, the development of an objective automatic pain 
      assessment method is critical to pain management in SCD. In this work, we 
      developed a continuous pain assessment model using physiological and body 
      movement sensor signals collected from a wearable wrist-worn device. 
      Specifically, we implemented ensemble feature selection methods to select robust 
      and stable features extracted from wearable data for better understanding of 
      pain. Our experiments showed that the stability of feature selection methods 
      could be substantially increased by using the ensemble approach. Since different 
      ensemble feature selection methods prefer varying feature subsets for pain 
      estimation, we further utilized stacked generalization to maximize the 
      information usage contained in the selected features from different methods. 
      Using this approach, our best performing model obtained the root-mean-square 
      error of 1.526 and the Pearson correlation of 0.618 for continuous pain 
      assessment. This indicates that subjective pain scores can be estimated using 
      objective wearable sensor data with high precision.

TI  - Artifacts annotations in anesthesia blood pressure data by man and machine.
PG  - 259-267

AB  - Physiologic data from anesthesia monitors are automatically captured. Yet 
      erroneous data are stored in the process as well. While this is not interfering 
      with clinical care, research can be affected. Researchers should find ways to 
      remove artifacts. The aim of the present study was to compare different artifact 
      annotation strategies, and to assess if a machine learning algorithm is able to 
      accept or reject individual data points. Non-cardiac procedures requiring 
      invasive blood pressure monitoring were eligible. Two trained research assistants 
      observed procedures live for artifacts. The same procedures were also 
      retrospectively annotated for artifacts by a different person. We compared the 
      different ways of artifact identifications and modelled artifacts with three 
      different learning algorithms (lasso restrictive logistic regression, neural 
      network and support vector machine). In 88 surgical procedures including 5711 
      blood pressure data points, the live observed incidence of artifacts was 2.1% and 
      the retrospective incidence was 2.2%. Comparing retrospective with live 
      annotation revealed a sensitivity of 0.32 and specificity of 0.98. The 
      performance of the learning algorithms which we applied ranged from poor (kappa 
      0.053) to moderate (kappa 0.651). Manual identification of artifacts yielded 
      different incidences in different situations, which were not comparable. Artifact 
      detection in physiologic data collected during anesthesia could be automated, but 
      the performance of the learning algorithms in the present study remained 
      moderate. Future research should focus on optimization and finding ways to apply 
      them with minimal manual work. The present study underlines the importance of an 
      explicit definition for artifacts in database research.

AB  - Capsule endoscopy (CE) is the first-line diagnostic modality for detecting small 
      bowel lesions. CE is non-invasive and does not require sedation, but its 
      movements cannot be controlled, it requires a long time for interpretation, and 
      it has lower image quality compared to wired endoscopy. With the rapid 
      advancement of technology, several methods to solve these problems have been 
      developed. This article describes the ongoing developments regarding external CE 
      locomotion using magnetic force, artificial intelligence-based interpretation, 
      and image-enhancing technologies with the CE system.

TI  - A Real-Time Depth of Anesthesia Monitoring System Based on Deep Neural Network 
      With Large EDO Tolerant EEG Analog Front-End.
PG  - 825-837
LID - 10.1109/TBCAS.2020.2998172 [doi]
AB  - In this article, we present a real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) based depth of 
      anesthesia (DoA) monitoring system in conjunction with a deep learning framework, 
      AnesNET. An EEG analog front-end (AFE) that can compensate ±380-mV electrode DC 
      offset using a coarse digital DC servo loop is implemented in the proposed 
      system. The EEG-based MAC, EEGMAC, is introduced as a novel index to accurately 
      predict the DoA, which is designed for applying to patients anesthetized by both 
      volatile and intravenous agents. The proposed deep learning protocol consists of 
      four layers of convolutional neural network and two dense layers. In addition, we 
      optimize the complexity of the deep neural network (DNN) to operate on a 
      microcomputer such as the Raspberry Pi 3, realizing a cost-effective small-size 
      DoA monitoring system. Fabricated in 110-nm CMOS, the prototype AFE consumes 4.33 
      μW per channel and has the input-referred noise of 0.29 μVrms from 0.5 to 100 Hz 
      with the noise efficiency factor of 2.2. The proposed DNN was evaluated with 
      pre-recorded EEG data from 374 subjects administrated by inhalational anesthetics 
      under surgery, achieving an average squared and absolute errors of 0.048 and 
      0.05, respectively. The EEGMAC with subjects anesthetized by an intravenous agent 
      also showed a good agreement with the bispectral index value, confirming the 
      proposed DoA index is applicable to both anesthetics. The implemented monitoring 
      system with the Raspberry Pi 3 estimates the EEGMAC within 20 ms, which is about 
      thousand-fold faster than the BIS estimation in literature.

TI  - Validation of Random Forest Machine Learning Models to Predict Dementia-Related 
      Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Real-World Data.
PG  - 855-864
LID - 10.3233/JAD-200345 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are the leading cause of the social 
      burden of dementia but their role is underestimated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of 
      the study was to validate predictive models to separately identify psychotic and 
      depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed with dementia using clinical databases 
      representing the whole population to inform decision-makers. METHODS: First, we 
      searched the electronic health records of 4,003 patients with dementia to 
      identify NPS. Second, machine learning (random forest) algorithms were applied to 
      build separate predictive models for psychotic and depressive symptom clusters in 
      the training set (N = 3,003). Third, calibration and discrimination were assessed 
      in the test set (N = 1,000) to assess the performance of the models. RESULTS: 
      Neuropsychiatric symptoms were noted in the electronic health record of 58% of 
      patients. The area under the receiver operating curve reached 0.80 for the 
      psychotic cluster model and 0.74 for the depressive cluster model. The Kappa 
      index and accuracy also showed better discrimination in the psychotic model. 
      Calibration plots indicated that both types of model had less predictive accuracy 
      when the probability of neuropsychiatric symptoms was <25%. The most important 
      variables in the psychotic cluster model were use of risperidone, level of 
      sedation, use of quetiapine and haloperidol and the number of antipsychotics 
      prescribed. In the depressive cluster model, the most important variables were 
      number of antidepressants prescribed, escitalopram use, level of sedation, and 
      age. CONCLUSION: Given their relatively good performance, the predictive models 
      can be used to estimate prevalence of NPS in population databases.

AB  - Opioids play a critical role in acute postoperative pain management. Our 
      objective was to develop machine learning models to predict postoperative opioid 
      requirements in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. To develop the models, we 
      used a perioperative dataset of 13,700 patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing 
      ambulatory surgery between the years 2016-2018. The data, comprising of patient, 
      procedure and provider factors that could influence postoperative pain and opioid 
      requirements, was randomly split into training (80%) and validation (20%) 
      datasets. Machine learning models of different classes were developed to predict 
      categorized levels of postoperative opioid requirements using the training 
      dataset and then evaluated on the validation dataset. Prediction accuracy was 
      used to differentiate model performances. The five types of models that were 
      developed returned the following accuracies at two different stages of surgery: 
      1) Prior to surgery-Multinomial Logistic Regression: 71%, Naïve Bayes: 67%, 
      Neural Network: 30%, Random Forest: 72%, Extreme Gradient Boost: 71% and 2) End 
      of surgery-Multinomial Logistic Regression: 71%, Naïve Bayes: 63%, Neural 
      Network: 32%, Random Forest: 72%, Extreme Gradient Boost: 70%. Analyzing the 
      sensitivities of the best performing Random Forest model showed that the lower 
      opioid requirements are predicted with better accuracy (89%) as compared with 
      higher opioid requirements (43%). Feature importance (% relative importance) of 
      model predictions showed that the type of procedure (15.4%), medical history 
      (12.9%) and procedure duration (12.0%) were the top three features contributing 
      to model predictions. Overall, the contribution of patient and procedure features 
      towards model predictions were 65% and 35% respectively. Machine learning models 
      could be used to predict postoperative opioid requirements in ambulatory surgery 
      patients and could potentially assist in better management of their postoperative 
      acute pain.

AB  - Complex neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia require drugs that can 
      target multiple G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to modulate complex 
      neuropsychiatric functions. Here, we report an automated system comprising a deep 
      recurrent neural network (RNN) and a multitask deep neural network (MTDNN) to 
      design and optimize multitarget antipsychotic drugs. The system has successfully 
      generated novel molecule structures with desired multiple target activities, 
      among which high-ranking compound 3 was synthesized, and demonstrated potent 
      activities against dopamine D(2), serotonin 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors. Hit 
      expansion based on the MTDNN was performed, 6 analogs of compound 3 were 
      evaluated experimentally, among which compound 8 not only exhibited specific 
      polypharmacology profiles but also showed antipsychotic effect in animal models 
      with low potential for sedation and catalepsy, highlighting their suitability for 
      further preclinical studies. The approach can be an efficient tool for designing 
      lead compounds with multitarget profiles to achieve the desired efficacy in the 
      treatment of complex neuropsychiatric diseases.

TI  - Functional and Structural Integrity of Frontoparietal Connectivity in Traumatic 
      and Anoxic Coma.
PG  - e639-e647
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000004406 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recovery from coma might critically depend on the structural and 
      functional integrity of frontoparietal networks. We aimed to measure this 
      integrity in traumatic brain injury and anoxo-ischemic (cardiac arrest) coma 
      patients by using an original multimodal MRI protocol. DESIGN: Prospective cohort 
      study. SETTING: Three Intensive Critical Care Units affiliated to the University 
      in Toulouse (France). PATIENTS: We longitudinally recruited 43 coma patients 
      (Glasgow Coma Scale at the admission < 8; 29 cardiac arrest and 14 traumatic 
      brain injury) and 34 age-matched healthy volunteers. Exclusion criteria were 
      disorders of consciousness lasting more than 30 days and focal brain damage 
      within the explored brain regions. Patient assessments were conducted at least 2 
      days (5 ± 2 d) after complete withdrawal of sedation. All patients were followed 
      up (Coma Recovery Scale-Revised) 3 months after acute brain injury. 
      INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Functional and structural MRI 
      data were recorded, and the analysis was targeted on the posteromedial cortex, 
      the medial prefrontal cortex, and the cingulum. Univariate analyses and machine 
      learning techniques were used to assess diagnostic and predictive values. Coma 
      patients displayed significantly lower medial prefrontal cortex-posteromedial 
      cortex functional connectivity (area under the curve, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93-0.95). 
      Cardiac arrest patients showed specific structural disturbances within 
      posteromedial cortex. Significant cingulum architectural disturbances were 
      observed in traumatic brain injury patients. The machine learning medial 
      prefrontal cortex-posteromedial cortex multimodal classifier had a significant 
      predictive value (area under the curve, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.97), best 
      combination of subregions that discriminates a binary outcome based on Coma 
      Recovery Scale-Revised). CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study suggests that 
      frontoparietal functional disconnections are specifically observed in coma and 
      their structural counterpart provides information about brain injury mechanisms. 
      Multimodal MRI biomarkers of frontoparietal disconnection predict 3-month outcome 
      in our sample. These findings suggest that fronto-parietal disconnection might be 
      particularly relevant for coma outcome prediction and could inspire innovative 
      precision medicine approaches.

PG  - 109-123
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002002 [doi]
AB  - Patients with chronic pain have complex pain profiles and associated problems. 
      Subgroup analysis can help identify key problems. We used a data-based approach 
      to define pain phenotypes and their most relevant associated problems in 320 
      patients undergoing tertiary pain management. Unsupervised machine learning 
      analysis of parameters "pain intensity," "number of pain areas," "pain duration," 
      "activity pain interference," and "affective pain interference," implemented as 
      emergent self-organizing maps, identified 3 patient phenotype clusters. 
      Supervised analyses, implemented as different types of decision rules, identified 
      "affective pain interference" and the "number of pain areas" as most relevant for 
      cluster assignment. These appeared 698 and 637 times, respectively, in 1000 
      cross-validation runs among the most relevant characteristics in an item 
      categorization approach in a computed ABC analysis. Cluster assignment was 
      achieved with a median balanced accuracy of 79.9%, a sensitivity of 74.1%, and a 
      specificity of 87.7%. In addition, among 59 demographic, pain etiology, 
      comorbidity, lifestyle, psychological, and treatment-related variables, sleep 
      problems appeared 638 and 439 times among the most important characteristics in 
      1000 cross-validation runs where patients were assigned to the 2 extreme pain 
      phenotype clusters. Also important were the parameters "fear of pain," 
      "self-rated poor health," and "systolic blood pressure." Decision trees trained 
      with this information assigned patients to the extreme pain phenotype with an 
      accuracy of 67%. Machine learning suggested sleep problems as key factors in the 
      most difficult pain presentations, therefore deserving priority in the treatment 
      of chronic pain.

TI  - EEG Beta-Band Spectral Entropy Can Predict the Effect of Drug Treatment on Pain 
      in Patients With Herpes Zoster.
PG  - 166-173

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication is the main approach for early treatment of herpes zoster, 
      but it could be ineffective in some patients. It is highly desired to predict the 
      medication responses to control the degree of pain for herpes zoster patients. 
      The present study is aimed to elucidate the relationship between medication 
      outcome and neural activity using EEG and to establish a machine learning model 
      for early prediction of the medication responses from EEG. METHODS: The authors 
      acquired and analyzed eye-closed resting-state EEG data 1 to 2 days after 
      medication from 70 herpes zoster patients with different drug treatment outcomes 
      (measured 5-6 days after medication): 45 medication-sensitive pain patients and 
      25 medication-resistant pain patients. EEG power spectral entropy of each 
      frequency band was compared at each channel between medication-sensitive pain and 
      medication-resistant pain patients, and those features showing significant 
      difference between two groups were used to predict medication outcome with 
      different machine learning methods. RESULTS: Medication-sensitive pain patients 
      showed significantly weaker beta-band power spectral entropy in the 
      central-parietal regions than medication-resistant pain patients. Based on these 
      EEG power spectral entropy features and a k-nearest neighbors classifier, the 
      medication outcome can be predicted with 80% ± 11.7% accuracy, 82.5% ± 14.7% 
      sensitivity, 77.7% ± 27.3% specificity, and an area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve of 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: EEG beta-band power spectral entropy 
      in the central-parietal region is predictive of the effectiveness of drug 
      treatment on herpes zoster patients, and it could potentially be used for early 
      pain management and therapeutic prognosis.

AB  - Pain relief is a major concern for patients who have undergone surgery, and it is 
      an eternal pursuit for anesthesiologists. However, postoperative pain management 
      is far from satisfactory, though the past decades have witnessed great progress 
      in the development of novel analgesics and analgesic techniques. A Cochrane 
      systematic review showed that patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) achieved better 
      pain relief and greater patient satisfaction than traditional "on-demand" 
      parenteral analgesia, suggesting that it might be the manner of analgesia 
      implementation that matters for effective postoperative pain management. A 
      wireless intelligent PCA (Wi-PCA) system that incorporated remote monitoring, an 
      intelligent alarm, intelligent analysis and assessment of the PCA equipment, as 
      well as automatically recording and reserving key information functions under a 
      wireless environment was introduced in our department in 2018. The practice 
      showed that the Wi-PCA system significantly reduced the incidence of moderate to 
      severe postoperative pain and relevant adverse effects, shortened hospital stays, 
      and improved patient satisfaction with postoperative pain relief. Nevertheless, 
      for both traditional and Wi-PCA, analgesics are only administered when pain 
      occurs, leaving behind a realm of possibilities for better postoperative pain 
      management. With the rapid development of machinery and deep learning algorithms, 
      artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the mode of clinical decision making. 
      Integrating the big data collected by state-of-the-art monitoring sensors, the 
      Internet of Things and AI algorithms, an AI-assisted PCA (Ai-PCA) may be a 
      promising future direction for postoperative pain management.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of consciousness during anesthesia without EEG data.
PG  - 993-1005
LID - 10.1007/s10877-020-00553-4 [doi]
AB  - Assessing the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is a daily challenge for 
      anesthesiologists. The best assessment of the depth of anesthesia is commonly 
      thought to be the one made by the doctor in charge of the patient. This 
      evaluation is based on the integration of several parameters including 
      epidemiological, pharmacological and physiological data. By developing a protocol 
      to record synchronously all these parameters we aim at having this evaluation 
      made by an algorithm. Our hypothesis was that the standard parameters recorded 
      during anesthesia (without EEG) could provide a good insight into the 
      consciousness level of the patient. We developed a complete solution for 
      high-resolution longitudinal follow-up of patients during anesthesia. A Hidden 
      Markov Model (HMM) was trained on the database in order to predict and assess 
      states based on four physiological variables that were adjusted to the 
      consciousness level: Heart Rate (HR), Mean Blood Pressure (MeanBP) Respiratory 
      Rate (RR), and AA Inspiratory Concentration (AAFi) all without using EEG 
      recordings. Patients undergoing general anesthesia for hernial inguinal repair 
      were included after informed consent. The algorithm was tested on 30 patients. 
      The percentage of error to identify the actual state among Awake, LOC, 
      Anesthesia, ROC and Emergence was 18%. This protocol constitutes the very first 
      step on the way towards a multimodal approach of anesthesia. The fact that our 
      first classifier already demonstrated a good predictability is very encouraging 
      for the future. Indeed, this first model was merely a proof of concept to 
      encourage research ways in the field of machine learning and anesthesia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to establish and validate a machine learning-based 
      model for the prediction of early phase postoperative hypertension (EPOH) 
      requiring the administration of intravenous vasodilators after carotid 
      endarterectomy (CEA). METHODS: Perioperative data from consecutive CEA procedures 
      performed from January 2013 to August 2019 were retrospectively collected. EPOH 
      was defined in post-CEA patients as hypertension involving a systolic blood 
      pressure above 160 mm Hg and requiring the administration of any intravenous 
      vasodilator medications in the first 24 hr after a return to the vascular ward. 
      Gradient boosted regression trees were used to construct the predictive model, 
      and the featured importance scores were generated by using each feature's 
      contribution to each tree in the model. To evaluate the model performance, the 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used as the main 
      metric. Four-fold stratified cross-validation was performed on the data set, and 
      the average performance of the 4 folds was reported as the final model 
      performance. RESULTS: A total of 406 CEA operations were performed under general 
      anesthesia. Fifty-three patients (13.1%) met the definition of EPOH. There was no 
      significant difference in the percentage of postoperative stroke/death between 
      patients with and without EPOH during the hospital stay. Patients with EPOH 
      exhibited a higher incidence of postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome 
      (7.5% vs. 0, P < 0.001), as well as a higher incidence of cerebral hemorrhage 
      (3.8% vs. 0, P < 0.001). The gradient boosted regression trees prediction model 
      achieved an average AUC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.92). When the sensitivity was 
      fixed near 0.90, the model achieved an average specificity of 0.52 (95% CI 0.28 
      to 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: We have built the first-ever machine learning-based 
      prediction model for EPOH after CEA. The validation result from our single-center 
      database was very promising. This novel prediction model has the potential to 
      help vascular surgeons identify high-risk patients and reduce related 
      complications more efficiently.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of pain is critical to its optimal treatment. There is a 
      high demand for accurate objective pain assessment for effectively optimizing 
      pain management interventions. However, pain is a multivalent, dynamic, and 
      ambiguous phenomenon that is difficult to quantify, particularly when the 
      patient's ability to communicate is limited. The criterion standard of pain 
      intensity assessment is self-reporting. However, this unidimensional model is 
      disparaged for its oversimplification and limited applicability in several 
      vulnerable patient populations. Researchers have attempted to develop objective 
      pain assessment tools through analysis of physiological pain indicators, such as 
      electrocardiography, electromyography, photoplethysmography, and electrodermal 
      activity. However, pain assessment by using only these signals can be unreliable, 
      as various other factors alter these vital signs and the adaptation of vital 
      signs to pain stimulation varies from person to person. Objective pain assessment 
      using behavioral signs such as facial expressions has recently gained attention. 
      OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to further the development and research of a pain 
      assessment tool for use with patients who are likely experiencing mild to 
      moderate pain. We will collect observational data through wearable technologies, 
      measuring facial electromyography, electrocardiography, photoplethysmography, and 
      electrodermal activity. METHODS: This protocol focuses on the second phase of a 
      larger study of multimodal signal acquisition through facial muscle electrical 
      activity, cardiac electrical activity, and electrodermal activity as indicators 
      of pain and for building predictive models. We used state-of-the-art standard 
      sensors to measure bioelectrical electromyographic signals and changes in heart 
      rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Based on the results, we further 
      developed the pain assessment tool and reconstituted it with modern wearable 
      sensors, devices, and algorithms. In this second phase, we will test the smart 
      pain assessment tool in communicative patients after elective surgery in the 
      recovery room. RESULTS: Our human research protections application for 
      institutional review board review was approved for this part of the study. We 
      expect to have the pain assessment tool developed and available for further 
      research in early 2021. Preliminary results will be ready for publication during 
      fall 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study will help to further the development of and 
      research on an objective pain assessment tool for monitoring patients likely 
      experiencing mild to moderate pain. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER

AB  - While both the annual incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer are slowly but 
      steadily decreasing in the United States, the incidence of such malignancy is 
      increasing in Japan. Thus, controlling colorectal cancer in Japan is a major 
      concern. In 2006, colon capsule endoscopy was first introduced by Eliakim et al. 
      First-generation colon capsule endoscopy had a moderate sensitivity for detecting 
      polyps of more than 6 mm. Thus, second-generation colon capsule endoscopy was 
      developed to achieve higher sensitivity. Colonoscopy is the gold standard tool 
      for colorectal cancer surveillance. With an improvement in the imaging function, 
      the performance of second-generation colon capsule endoscopy is almost as 
      satisfactory as that of colonoscopy. Certain situations, such as incomplete 
      colonoscopy and contraindication for use of sedation, can benefit from colon 
      capsule endoscopy. Colon capsule endoscopy requires a more extensive bowel 
      preparation than colonoscopy and computed tomography colonography because it 
      requires laxatives not only for bowel cleansing but also for promoting the 
      excretion of the capsule. Another problem with colon capsule endoscopy includes 
      the burden of reading and interpretation and overlook of the lesions. Currently, 
      the development of automatic diagnosis of colon capsule endoscopy using 
      artificial intelligence is still under progress. Although the available 
      guidelines do not support the use of colon capsule endoscopy for inflammatory 
      bowel disease, the possible application of colon capsule endoscopy is ulcerative 
      colitis. This review article summarizes and focuses on the current status of 
      colon capsule endoscopy for colorectal cancer screening and the possibility for 
      its applicability on inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - The role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in clinical anaesthesia 
      practice.
PG  - 483-489
LID - 10.1097/ACO.0000000000000881 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Growing concerns about the environmental effects of volatile 
      anaesthetics are likely to lead to increased use of intravenous anaesthetic 
      drugs. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models can increase the accuracy of 
      intravenous drug titration, especially in populations that differ from the 
      'average.' However, with a growing number of PKPD models, and other technology 
      available to date, it can be hard to see the wood for the trees. This review 
      attempts to guide the reader through the PKPD jungle. RECENT FINDINGS: General 
      purpose PKPD models for propofol and remifentanil designed to apply to a broader 
      population, including children, the elderly and the obese, reduce the need for 
      population-specific models. PKPD models for drugs such as dexmedetomidine and 
      antimicrobial agents may be useful for procedural sedation or in the ICU. 
      Technological advances such as Bayesian model adjustment based on point-of-care 
      plasma concentration measurements, closed-loop drug delivery and artificial 
      intelligence may improve the ease of use of the anaesthetic drugs and increase 
      the accuracy of titration. SUMMARY: Newer and more complex modelling techniques 
      and technological advancements can help to deliver anaesthetic drugs, sedatives 
      and other drugs in a more stable and thereby safer way.

PG  - 187-191
LID - 10.12116/j.issn.1004-5619.2020.02.008 [doi]
AB  - Objective To infer postmortem interval （PMI） based on spectral changes of the 
      dorsal skin of rats within 15 days postmortem using Fourier transform infrared 
      （FTIR） spectroscopy. Methods The rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 
      after anesthesia, and then placed at 25 ℃ and relative humidity of 50%. The FTIR 
      spectral data collected from the dorsal skin at PMI points were modeled with 
      machine learning technique. Results There was no significant difference of 
      absorption peak location among all the PMI groups but their peak intensities 
      changed as a function of PMIs. The model for PMI estimation was constructed using 
      partial least squares （PLS） regression, reaching a R(2) of 0.92 and a root mean 
      square error （RMSE） of 1.30 d. As shown in variable importance for projection 
      （VIP）, four spectral bands including 1 760-1 700 cm(-1), 1 660-1 640 cm(-1), 1 
      580-1 540 cm(-1) and 1 460-1 420 cm(-1) were determined as important 
      contributions to model prediction. Conclusion Application of the FTIR technique 
      to detect postmortem spectral changes of the rat skin provides a novel proposal 
      for PMI estimation.

TI  - Construction and Comparison of Predictive Models for Length of Stay after Total 
      Knee Arthroplasty: Regression Model and Machine Learning Analysis Based on 1,826 
      Cases in a Single Singapore Center.
PG  - 7-14

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive model for length of stay 
      (LOS) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Between 2013 and 2014, 1,826 patients 
      who underwent TKA from a single Singapore center were enrolled in the study after 
      qualification. Demographics of patients with normal and prolonged LOS were 
      analyzed. The risk variables that could affect LOS were identified by univariate 
      analysis. Predictive models for LOS after TKA by logistic regression or machine 
      learning were constructed and compared. The univariate analysis showed that age, 
      American Society of Anesthesiologist level, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, 
      congestive heart failure, general anesthesia, and operation duration were risk 
      factors that could affect LOS (p < 0.05). Comparing with logistic regression 
      models, the machine learning model with all variables was the best model to 
      predict LOS after TKA, of whose area of operator characteristic curve was 0.738. 
      Machine learning algorithms improved the predictive performance of LOS prediction 
      models for TKA patients.

AB  - The practice of anesthesiology is inextricably dependent upon technology. 
      Anesthetics were first made possible, then increasingly safe, and now more 
      scalable and efficient in part due to advances in monitoring and delivery 
      technology. Herein, we discuss salient advances of the last three years in the 
      technology of anesthesiology. Consumer technology and telemedicine have exploded 
      onto the scene of outpatient medicine, and perioperative management is no 
      exception. Preoperative evaluations have been done via teleconference, and 
      copious consumer-generated health data is available. Regulators have acknowledged 
      the vast potential found in the transfer of consumer technology to medical 
      practice, but issues of privacy, data ownership/security, and validity remain. 
      Inside the operating suite, monitoring has become less invasive, and clinical 
      decision support systems are common. These technologies are susceptible to the 
      "garbage in, garbage out" conundrum plaguing artificial intelligence, but they 
      will improve as network latency decreases. Automation looms large in the future 
      of anesthesiology as closed-loop anesthesia delivery systems are being tested in 
      combination (moving toward a comprehensive system). Moving forward, consumer 
      health companies will search for applications of their technology, and loosely 
      regulated health markets will see earlier adoption of next-generation technology. 
      Innovations coming to anesthesia will need to account for human factors as the 
      anesthesia provider is increasingly considered a component of the patient care 
      apparatus.

      learning models.
PG  - 046020
LID - 10.1088/1741-2552/ab98da [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ability to monitor anesthetic states using automated approaches is 
      expected to reduce inaccurate drug dosing and side-effects. Commercially 
      available anesthetic state monitors perform poorly when ketamine is administered 
      as an anesthetic-analgesic adjunct. Poor performance is likely because the models 
      underlying these monitors are not optimized for the electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      oscillations that are unique to the co-administration of ketamine. APPROACH: In 
      this work, we designed two k-nearest neighbors algorithms for anesthetic state 
      prediction. MAIN RESULTS: The first algorithm was trained only on sevoflurane EEG 
      data, making it sevoflurane-specific. This algorithm enabled discrimination of 
      the sevoflurane general anesthesia (GA) state from sedated and awake states (true 
      positive rate = 0.87, [95% CI, 0.76, 0.97]). However, it did not enable 
      discrimination of the sevoflurane-plus-ketamine GA state from sedated and awake 
      states (true positive rate = 0.43, [0.19, 0.67]). In our second algorithm, we 
      implemented a cross drug training paradigm by including both sevoflurane and 
      sevoflurane-plus-ketamine EEG data in our training set. This algorithm enabled 
      discrimination of the sevoflurane-plus-ketamine GA state from sedated and awake 
      states (true positive rate = 0.91, [0.84, 0.98]). SIGNIFICANCE: Instead of a 
      one-algorithm-fits-all-drugs approach to anesthetic state monitoring, our results 
      suggest that drug-specific models are necessary to improve the performance of 
      automated anesthetic state monitors.

TI  - A possible role for inducible arginase isoform (AI) in the pathogenesis of 
      chronic venous leg ulcer.
PG  - 9974-9991
LID - 10.1002/jcp.29812 [doi]
AB  - Chronic venous ulcer (CVU) is a major cause of chronic wounds of lower 
      extremities and presents a significant financial and resource burden to health 
      care systems worldwide. Defects in the vasculature, matrix deposition, and 
      re-epithelialization are the main histopathological changes believed to impede 
      healing. Supplementation of the amino acid arginine that plays a crucial role in 
      the interactions that occur during inflammation and wound healing was proven 
      clinically to improve acute wound healing probably through enhancing activity of 
      inducible arginase (AI) locally in the wounds. However, the possible mechanism of 
      arginine action and the potential beneficial effects of AI/arginine in human 
      chronic wounds remain unclear. In the present study, using biopsies, taken under 
      local anesthesia, from adult patients (n = 12, mean age 55 years old) with CVUs 
      in lower extremities, we investigated the correlation between AI distribution in 
      CVUs and the histopathological changes, mainly proliferative and vascular 
      changes. Our results show a distinct spatial distribution of AI along the ulcer 
      in the epidermis and in the dermis with the highest level of expression being at 
      the ulcer edge and the least expression towards the ulcer base. The AI cellular 
      immunoreactivity, enzymatic activity, and protein levels were significantly 
      increased towards the ulcer edge. Interestingly, a similar pattern of expression 
      was encountered in the proliferative and the vascular changes with strong 
      correlations between AI and the proliferative activity and vascular changes. 
      Furthermore, AI cellular distribution was associated with increased proliferative 
      activity, inflammation, and vascular changes. Our findings of differential 
      expression of AI along the CVU base, edge, and nearby surrounding skin and its 
      associations with increased proliferative activity and vascular changes provide 
      further support to the AI implication in CVU pathogenesis. The presence of high 
      levels of AI in the epidermis of chronic wounds may serve as a molecular marker 
      of impaired healing and may provide future targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Outpatient postoperative pain management in spine patients, 
      specifically involving the use of opioids, demonstrates significant variability. 
      PURPOSE: Using preoperative risk factors and 30-day postoperative opioid 
      prescribing patterns, we developed models for predicting long-term opioid use in 
      patients after elective spine surgery. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This retrospective 
      cohort study utilizes inpatient, outpatient, and pharmaceutical data from 
      MarketScan databases (Truven Health). PATIENT SAMPLE: In all, 19,317 patients who 
      were newly diagnosed with low back or lower extremity pain (LBP or LEP) between 
      2008 and 2015 and underwent thoracic or lumbar surgery within 1 year after 
      diagnosis were enrolled. Some patients initiated opioids after diagnosis but all 
      patients were opioid-naïve before the diagnosis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Long-term 
      opioid use was defined as filling ≥180 days of opioids within one year after 
      surgery. METHODS: Using demographic variables, medical and psychiatric 
      comorbidities, preoperative opioid use, and 30-day postoperative opioid use, we 
      generated seven models on 80% of the dataset and tested the models on the 
      remaining 20%. We used three regression-based models (full logistic regression, 
      stepwise logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), 
      support vector machine, two tree-based models (random forest, stochastic gradient 
      boosting), and time-varying convolutional neural network. Area under the curve 
      (AUC), Brier index, sensitivity, and calibration curves were used to assess the 
      discrimination and calibration of the models. RESULTS: We identified 903 (4.6%) 
      of patients who met criteria for long-term opioid use. The regression-based 
      models demonstrated the highest AUC, ranging from 0.835 to 0.847, and relatively 
      high sensitivities, predicting between 74.9% and 76.5% of the long-term opioid 
      use patients in the test dataset. The three strongest positive predictors of 
      long-term opioid use were high preoperative opioid use (OR 2.70; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 2.27-3.22), number of days with active opioid prescription between 
      postoperative days 15 to 30 (OR 1.10; 95%CI 1.07-1.12), and number of dosage 
      increases between postoperative day 15 to 30 (OR 1.71, 95%CI 1.41-2.08). The 
      strongest negative predictors were number of dosage decreases in the 30-day 
      postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated several predictive models for 
      postoperative long-term opioid use in a large cohort of patients with LBP or LEP 
      who underwent surgery. A regression-based model with high sensitivity and AUC is 
      provided online to screen patients for high risk of long-term opioid use based on 
      preoperative risk factors and opioid prescription patterns in the first 30 days 
      after surgery. It is hoped that this work will improve identification of patients 
      at high risk of prolonged opioid use and enable early intervention and 
      counseling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis legalization may contribute to an increased frequency of 
      chronic use among patients presenting for surgery. At present, it is unknown 
      whether chronic cannabis use modifies the risk of postoperative nausea and 
      vomiting (PONV). METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study conducted 
      at 2 academic medical centers. Twenty-seven thousand three hundred eighty-eight 
      adult ASA 1-3 patients having general anesthesia for non-obstetric, non-cardiac 
      procedures and receiving postoperative care in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit 
      (PACU) were analyzed in the main dataset, and 16,245 patients in the external 
      validation dataset. The main predictor was patient reported use of cannabis in 
      any form collected during pre-anesthesia evaluation and recorded in the chart. 
      The primary outcome was documented PONV of any severity prior to PACU discharge, 
      including administration of rescue medications in PACU. Relevant clinical 
      covariates (risk factors for PONV, surgical characteristics, administered 
      prophylactic antiemetic drugs) were also recorded. RESULTS: 10.0% of patients in 
      the analytic dataset endorsed chronic cannabis use. Using Bayesian Additive 
      Regression Trees (BART), we estimated that the relative risk for PONV associated 
      with daily cannabis use was 1.19 (95 CI% 1.00-1.45). The absolute marginal 
      increase in risk of PONV associated with daily cannabis use was 3.3% (95% CI 
      0.4-6.4%). We observed a lesser association between current, non-daily use of 
      cannabis (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94-1.21). An internal validation analysis conducted 
      using propensity score adjustment and Bayesian logistic modeling indicated a 
      similar size and magnitude of the association between cannabis use and PONV (OR 
      1.15, 90% CI 0.98-1.33). As an external validation, we used data from another 
      hospital in our care system to create an independent model that demonstrated 
      essentially identical associations between cannabis use and PONV. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cannabis use is associated with an increased relative risk and a small increase 
      in the marginal probability of PONV.

TI  - Deep Learning Neural Networks to Predict Serious Complications After Bariatric 
      Surgery: Analysis of Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry Data.
PG  - e15992
LID - 10.2196/15992 [doi]
LID - e15992
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is one of today's most visible public health problems 
      worldwide. Although modern bariatric surgery is ostensibly considered safe, 
      serious complications and mortality still occur in some patients. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to explore whether serious postoperative complications of bariatric 
      surgery recorded in a national quality registry can be predicted preoperatively 
      using deep learning methods. METHODS: Patients who were registered in the 
      Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg) between 2010 and 2015 were included 
      in this study. The patients who underwent a bariatric procedure between 2010 and 
      2014 were used as training data, and those who underwent a bariatric procedure in 
      2015 were used as test data. Postoperative complications were graded according to 
      the Clavien-Dindo classification, and complications requiring intervention under 
      general anesthesia or resulting in organ failure or death were considered 
      serious. Three supervised deep learning neural networks were applied and compared 
      in our study: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), 
      and recurrent neural network (RNN). The synthetic minority oversampling technique 
      (SMOTE) was used to artificially augment the patients with serious complications. 
      The performances of the neural networks were evaluated using accuracy, 
      sensitivity, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: In total, 37,811 and 6250 
      patients were used as the training data and test data, with incidence rates of 
      serious complication of 3.2% (1220/37,811) and 3.0% (188/6250), respectively. 
      When trained using the SMOTE data, the MLP appeared to have a desirable 
      performance, with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95% CI 0.83-0.85). However, 
      its performance was low for the test data, with an AUC of 0.54 (95% CI 
      0.53-0.55). The performance of CNN was similar to that of MLP. It generated AUCs 
      of 0.79 (95% CI 0.78-0.80) and 0.57 (95% CI 0.59-0.61) for the SMOTE data and 
      test data, respectively. Compared with the MLP and CNN, the RNN showed worse 
      performance, with AUCs of 0.65 (95% CI 0.64-0.66) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.53-0.57) for 
      the SMOTE data and test data, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MLP and CNN showed 
      improved, but limited, ability for predicting the postoperative serious 
      complications after bariatric surgery in the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery 
      Registry data. However, the overfitting issue is still apparent and needs to be 
      overcome by incorporating intra- and perioperative information.

TI  - Comparison of the clinical effectiveness of treatments for aromatase 
      inhibitor-induced arthralgia in breast cancer patients: a protocol for a 
      systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - e033461
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033461 [doi]
LID - e033461
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia (AIA) is a major adverse 
      event of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and leads to premature discontinuation of AI 
      therapy in breast cancer patients. The objective of this protocol for a 
      systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) is to provide the methodology 
      to compare the change in pain intensity between different AIA treatments and 
      demonstrate the rank probabilities for different treatments by combining all 
      available direct and indirect evidence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PubMed, the 
      Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, Web of Science and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov will be searched to identify publications in English from 
      inception to November 2019. We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
      assessing the effects of different treatments for AIA in postmenopausal women 
      with stage 0-III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The primary endpoints 
      will be the change in patient-reported pain intensity from baseline to 
      post-treatment. The number of adverse events will be presented as a secondary 
      outcome.Both pairwise meta-analysis and NMA with the Frequentist approach will be 
      conducted. We will demonstrate summary estimates with forest plots in 
      meta-analysis and direct and mixed evidence with a ranking of the treatments as 
      the P-score in NMA. The revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials 
      will be used to assess the methodological quality within individual RCTs. The 
      quality of evidence will be assessed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As this review 
      does not involve individual patients, ethical approval is not required. The 
      results of this systematic review and NMA will be published in a peer-reviewed 
      journal. This review will provide valuable information on AIA therapeutic options 
      for clinicians, health practitioners and breast cancer survivors. PROSPERO

      isoflurane anesthesia.
PG  - 2285-2296
LID - 10.1152/jn.00092.2020 [doi]
AB  - This study quantified eight small-molecule neurotransmitters collected 
      simultaneously from prefrontal cortex of C57BL/6J mice (n = 23) during 
      wakefulness and during isoflurane anesthesia (1.3%). Using isoflurane anesthesia 
      as an independent variable enabled evaluation of the hypothesis that isoflurane 
      anesthesia differentially alters concentrations of multiple neurotransmitters and 
      their interactions. Machine learning was applied to reveal higher order 
      interactions among neurotransmitters. Using a between-subjects design, 
      microdialysis was performed during wakefulness and during anesthesia. 
      Concentrations (nM) of acetylcholine, adenosine, dopamine, GABA, glutamate, 
      histamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the dialysis samples are reported 
      (means ± SD). Relative to wakefulness, acetylcholine concentration was lower 
      during isoflurane anesthesia (1.254 ± 1.118 vs. 0.401 ± 0.134, P = 0.009), and 
      concentrations of adenosine (29.456 ± 29.756 vs. 101.321 ± 38.603, P < 0.001), 
      dopamine (0.0578 ± 0.0384 vs. 0.113 ± 0.084, P = 0.036), and norepinephrine 
      (0.126 ± 0.080 vs. 0.219 ± 0.066, P = 0.010) were higher during anesthesia. 
      Isoflurane reconfigured neurotransmitter interactions in prefrontal cortex, and 
      the state of isoflurane anesthesia was reliably predicted by prefrontal cortex 
      concentrations of adenosine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. A novel finding 
      to emerge from machine learning analyses is that neurotransmitter concentration 
      profiles in mouse prefrontal cortex undergo functional reconfiguration during 
      isoflurane anesthesia. Adenosine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine showed high 
      feature importance, supporting the interpretation that interactions among these 
      three transmitters may play a key role in modulating levels of cortical and 
      behavioral arousal.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study discovered that interactions 
      between neurotransmitters in mouse prefrontal cortex were altered during 
      isoflurane anesthesia relative to wakefulness. Machine learning further 
      demonstrated that, relative to wakefulness, higher order interactions among 
      neurotransmitters were disrupted during isoflurane administration. These findings 
      extend to the neurochemical domain the concept that anesthetic-induced loss of 
      wakefulness results from a disruption of neural network connectivity.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute care technologies, including novel monitoring devices, 
      big data, increased computing capabilities, machine-learning algorithms and 
      automation, are converging. This enables the application of augmented 
      intelligence for improved outcome predictions, clinical decision-making, and 
      offers unprecedented opportunities to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and 
      improve clinician workflow. This article briefly explores recent work in the 
      areas of automation, artificial intelligence and outcome prediction models in 
      pediatric anesthesia and pediatric critical care. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent years 
      have yielded little published research into pediatric physiological closed loop 
      control (a type of automation) beyond studies focused on glycemic control for 
      type 1 diabetes. However, there has been a greater range of research in augmented 
      decision-making, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine-learning 
      techniques, in particular, for pediatric ICU outcome prediction. SUMMARY: Most 
      studies focusing on artificial intelligence demonstrate good performance on 
      prediction or classification, whether they use traditional statistical tools or 
      novel machine-learning approaches. Yet the challenges of implementation, user 
      acceptance, ethics and regulation cannot be underestimated. Areas in which there 
      is easy access to routinely labeled data and robust outcomes, such as those 
      collected through national networks and quality improvement programs, are likely 
      to be at the forefront of the adoption of these advances.

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is currently changing very 
      different areas of life. Artificial intelligence involves the emulation of human 
      behavior with the aid of methods from mathematics and informatics. Machine 
      learning (ML) represents a subdivision of AI. Algorithms for ML have the 
      potential to optimize patient care, in that they can be utilized in a supportive 
      way in personalized medicine, decision making and risk prediction. Although the 
      majority of the applications in medicine are still limited to data analysis and 
      research, it is certain that ML will become increasingly more important in 
      scientific and clinical aspects in this supportive function. Therefore, it is 
      necessary for clinicians to have at least a basic understanding of the functional 
      principles, strengths and weaknesses of ML.

AB  - Arterial hypotension during the early phase of anesthesia can lead to adverse 
      outcomes such as a prolonged postoperative stay or even death. Predicting 
      hypotension during anesthesia induction is complicated by its diverse causes. We 
      investigated the feasibility of developing a machine-learning model to predict 
      postinduction hypotension. Naïve Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and 
      artificial neural network models were trained to predict postinduction 
      hypotension, occurring between tracheal intubation and incision, using data for 
      the period from between the start of anesthesia induction and immediately before 
      tracheal intubation obtained from an anesthesia monitor, a drug administration 
      infusion pump, an anesthesia machine, and from patients' demographics, together 
      with preexisting disease information from electronic health records. Among 222 
      patients, 126 developed postinduction hypotension. The random-forest model showed 
      the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve of 0.842 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.736-0.948). This was higher than 
      that for the Naïve Bayes (0.778; 95% CI: 0.65-0.898), logistic regression (0.756; 
      95% CI: 0.630-0.881), and artificial-neural-network (0.760; 95% CI: 0.640-0.880) 
      models. The most important features affecting the accuracy of machine-learning 
      prediction were a patient's lowest systolic blood pressure, lowest mean blood 
      pressure, and mean systolic blood pressure before tracheal intubation. We found 
      that machine-learning models using data obtained from various anesthesia machines 
      between the start of anesthesia induction and immediately before tracheal 
      intubation can predict hypotension occurring during the period between tracheal 
      intubation and incision.

AB  - Assessing the well-being of an animal is hindered by the limitations of efficient 
      communication between humans and animals. Instead of direct communication, a 
      variety of parameters are employed to evaluate the well-being of an animal. 
      Especially in the field of biomedical research, scientifically sound tools to 
      assess pain, suffering, and distress for experimental animals are highly demanded 
      due to ethical and legal reasons. For mice, the most commonly used laboratory 
      animals, a valuable tool is the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS), a coding system for 
      facial expressions of pain in mice. We aim to develop a fully automated system 
      for the surveillance of post-surgical and post-anesthetic effects in mice. Our 
      work introduces a semi-automated pipeline as a first step towards this goal. A 
      new data set of images of black-furred laboratory mice that were moving freely is 
      used and provided. Images were obtained after anesthesia (with isoflurane or 
      ketamine/xylazine combination) and surgery (castration). We deploy two 
      pre-trained state of the art deep convolutional neural network (CNN) 
      architectures (ResNet50 and InceptionV3) and compare to a third CNN architecture 
      without pre-training. Depending on the particular treatment, we achieve an 
      accuracy of up to 99% for the recognition of the absence or presence of 
      post-surgical and/or post-anesthetic effects on the facial expression.

AB  - Artificial intelligence-driven anesthesiology and perioperative care may just be 
      around the corner. However, its promises of improved safety and patient outcomes 
      can only become a reality if we take the time to examine its technical, ethical, 
      and moral implications. The aim of perioperative medicine is to diagnose, treat, 
      and prevent disease. As we introduce new interventions or devices, we must take 
      care to do so with a conscience, keeping patient care as the main objective, and 
      understanding that humanism is a core component of our practice. In our article, 
      we outline key principles of artificial intelligence for the perioperative 
      physician and explore limitations and ethical challenges in the field.

TI  - Forecasting a Crisis: Machine-Learning Models Predict Occurrence of 
      Intraoperative Bradycardia Associated With Hypotension.
PG  - 1201-1210
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000004636 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Predictive analytics systems may improve perioperative care by 
      enhancing preparation for, recognition of, and response to high-risk clinical 
      events. Bradycardia is a fairly common and unpredictable clinical event with many 
      causes; it may be benign or become associated with hypotension requiring 
      aggressive treatment. Our aim was to build models to predict the occurrence of 
      clinically significant intraoperative bradycardia at 3 time points during an 
      operative course by utilizing available preoperative electronic medical record 
      and intraoperative anesthesia information management system data. METHODS: The 
      analyzed data include 62,182 scheduled noncardiac procedures performed at the 
      University of Washington Medical Center between 2012 and 2017. The clinical event 
      was defined as severe bradycardia (heart rate <50 beats per minute) followed by 
      hypotension (mean arterial pressure <55 mm Hg) within a 10-minute window. We 
      developed models to predict the presence of at least 1 event following 3 time 
      points: induction of anesthesia (TP1), start of the procedure (TP2), and 30 
      minutes after the start of the procedure (TP3). Predictor variables were based on 
      data available before each time point and included preoperative patient and 
      procedure data (TP1), followed by intraoperative minute-to-minute patient 
      monitor, ventilator, intravenous fluid, infusion, and bolus medication data (TP2 
      and TP3). Machine-learning and logistic regression models were developed, and 
      their predictive abilities were evaluated using the area under the ROC curve 
      (AUC). The contribution of the input variables to the models were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: The number of events was 3498 (5.6%) after TP1, 2404 (3.9%) after TP2, 
      and 1066 (1.7%) after TP3. Heart rate was the strongest predictor for events 
      after TP1. Occurrence of a previous event, mean heart rate, and mean pulse rates 
      before TP2 were the strongest predictor for events after TP2. Occurrence of a 
      previous event, mean heart rate, mean pulse rates before TP2 (and their 
      interaction), and 15-minute slopes in heart rate and blood pressure before TP2 
      were the strongest predictors for events after TP3. The best performing 
      machine-learning models including all cases produced an AUC of 0.81 (TP1), 0.87 
      (TP2), and 0.89 (TP3) with positive predictive values of 0.30, 0.29, and 0.15 at 
      95% specificity, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We developed models to predict 
      unstable bradycardia leveraging preoperative and real-time intraoperative data. 
      Our study demonstrates how predictive models may be utilized to predict clinical 
      events across multiple time intervals, with a future goal of developing 
      real-time, intraoperative, decision support.

TI  - Early Detection of Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction Using 
      Perioperative Data Among Noncardiac Surgical Patients: A Machine-Learning 
      Approach.
PG  - 1188-1200
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000004630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a condition 
      imposing significant health care burden. Given its syndromic nature and often 
      insidious onset, the diagnosis may not be made until clinical manifestations 
      prompt further evaluation. Detecting HFrEF in precursor stages could allow for 
      early initiation of treatments to modify disease progression. Granular data 
      collected during the perioperative period may represent an underutilized method 
      for improving the diagnosis of HFrEF. We hypothesized that patients ultimately 
      diagnosed with HFrEF following surgery can be identified via machine-learning 
      approaches using pre- and intraoperative data. METHODS: Perioperative data were 
      reviewed from adult patients undergoing general anesthesia for major surgical 
      procedures at an academic quaternary care center between 2010 and 2016. Patients 
      with known HFrEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, preoperative 
      critical illness, or undergoing cardiac, cardiology, or electrophysiologic 
      procedures were excluded. Patients were classified as healthy controls or 
      undiagnosed HFrEF. Undiagnosed HFrEF was defined as lacking a HFrEF diagnosis 
      preoperatively but establishing a diagnosis within 730 days postoperatively. 
      Undiagnosed HFrEF patients were adjudicated by expert clinician review, excluding 
      cases for which HFrEF was secondary to a perioperative triggering event, or any 
      event not associated with HFrEF natural disease progression. Machine-learning 
      models, including L1 regularized logistic regression, random forest, and extreme 
      gradient boosting were developed to detect undiagnosed HFrEF, using perioperative 
      data including 628 preoperative and 1195 intraoperative features. 
      Training/validation and test datasets were used with parameter tuning. Test set 
      model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC), positive predictive value, and other standard 
      metrics. RESULTS: Among 67,697 cases analyzed, 279 (0.41%) patients had 
      undiagnosed HFrEF. The AUROC for the logistic regression model was 0.869 (95% 
      confidence interval, 0.829-0.911), 0.872 (0.836-0.909) for the random forest 
      model, and 0.873 (0.833-0.913) for the extreme gradient boosting model. The 
      corresponding positive predictive values were 1.69% (1.06%-2.32%), 1.42% 
      (0.85%-1.98%), and 1.78% (1.15%-2.40%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Machine-learning models leveraging perioperative data can detect undiagnosed 
      HFrEF with good performance. However, the low prevalence of the disease results 
      in a low positive predictive value, and for clinically meaningful sensitivity 
      thresholds to be actionable, confirmatory testing with high specificity (eg, 
      echocardiography or cardiac biomarkers) would be required following model 
      detection. Future studies are necessary to externally validate algorithm 
      performance at additional centers and explore the feasibility of embedding 
      algorithms into the perioperative electronic health record for clinician use in 
      real time.

TI  - Prediction of an Acute Hypotensive Episode During an ICU Hospitalization With a 
      Super Learner Machine-Learning Algorithm.
PG  - 1157-1166
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000004539 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute hypotensive episodes (AHE), defined as a drop in the mean 
      arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mm Hg lasting at least 5 consecutive minutes, are 
      among the most critical events in the intensive care unit (ICU). They are known 
      to be associated with adverse outcome in critically ill patients. AHE prediction 
      is of prime interest because it could allow for treatment adjustment to predict 
      or shorten AHE. METHODS: The Super Learner (SL) algorithm is an ensemble 
      machine-learning algorithm that we specifically trained to predict an AHE 10 
      minutes in advance. Potential predictors included age, sex, type of care unit, 
      severity scores, and time-evolving characteristics such as mechanical 
      ventilation, vasopressors, or sedation medication as well as features extracted 
      from physiological signals: heart rate, pulse oximetry, and arterial blood 
      pressure. The algorithm was trained on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
      Care dataset (MIMIC II) database. Internal validation was based on the area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the Brier score (BS). 
      External validation was performed using an external dataset from Lariboisière 
      hospital, Paris, France. RESULTS: Among 1151 patients included, 826 (72%) 
      patients had at least 1 AHE during their ICU stay. Using 1 single random period 
      per patient, the SL algorithm with Haar wavelets transform preprocessing was 
      associated with an AUROC of 0.929 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.899-0.958) and 
      a BS of 0.08. Using all available periods for each patient, SL with Haar wavelets 
      transform preprocessing was associated with an AUROC of 0.890 (95% CI, 
      0.886-0.895) and a BS of 0.11. In the external validation cohort, the AUROC 
      reached 0.884 (95% CI, 0.775-0.993) with 1 random period per patient and 0.889 
      (0.768-1) with all available periods and BSs <0.1. CONCLUSIONS: The SL algorithm 
      exhibits good performance for the prediction of an AHE 10 minutes ahead of time. 
      It allows an efficient, robust, and rapid evaluation of the risk of hypotension 
      that opens the way to routine use.

TI  - Dental caries treatment completed under general anesthesia among American Indian 
      children in a northern plains tribal community.
PG  - 254-256
LID - 10.1111/jphd.12369 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the occurrence of treatment under general anesthesia (GA) 
      for dental caries among American Indian (AI) children from a Northern Plains 
      tribal community. METHODS: As part of a follow-up study of ECC, dental records 
      for children age 6-8 years were evaluated. Descriptive statistics were generated, 
      including the number of dental visits, extent of treatment, and whether the 
      treatment was completed under GA. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 95 dental 
      records. The age of dental visits varied from 15 months to 8 years. Of the 95 
      children, 79 (83.2%) received dental treatment under GA at least once; 24 (25.2%) 
      did so two or more times. The majority of the treatment involved extractions and 
      placement of stainless steel crowns. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of AI children 
      received dental treatment under GA; many did so multiple times. Given the high 
      cost of this treatment, even modestly effective preventive strategies such as 
      silver diamine fluoride could yield cost savings.

TI  - The Association Between Developmental Defects of Enamel and Early Childhood 
      Caries in American Indian Children: A Retrospective Chart Review.
PG  - 126-131
AB  - Purpose: To determine the prevalence of developmental defects of enamel (DDE) 
      among American Indian (AI) children and whether DDE are associated with caries 
      experience and rehabilitative treatment under general anesthesia (GA). Methods: 
      This retrospective study reviewed charts of 557 AI children, between 12 and 84 
      months of age, served by one Indian Health Service clinic in Sisseton, SD, USA. 
      Analyses included descriptive and bivariate statistics, including odds ratios 
      (OR). P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The overall prevalence of DDE 
      was 32.5% (mean equals 0.87±1.59 per child). The presence of DDE was associated 
      with significantly higher mean decayed, extracted and filled (deft) scores 
      (7.94±5.06 versus 4.84±5.14; P<0.001), predicting adverse clinical outcomes. 
      Children with DDE had 3.8, 4.2, and 3.4 times the odds of having caries, 
      early-childhood-caries (ECC), and severe early-childhood-caries (S-ECC), 
      respectively, than those without DDE. DDE were also associated with higher odds 
      of treatment under GA (OR equals 4.4). Conclusions: DDE were prevalent in this 
      cohort of AI children and found to be significantly associated with a higher 
      caries burden and dental rehabilitation under GA. Early recognition of DDE in 
      infants and toddlers along with targeted prevention programs may help reduce the 
      incidence of caries and subsequent treatment under GA.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing anesthesiology research. Unlike 
      classical research methods that are largely inference-based, ML is geared more 
      towards making accurate predictions. ML is a field of artificial intelligence 
      concerned with developing algorithms and models to perform prediction tasks in 
      the absence of explicit instructions. Most ML applications, despite being highly 
      variable in the topics that they deal with, generally follow a common workflow. 
      For classification tasks, a researcher typically tests various ML models and 
      compares the predictive performance with the reference logistic regression model. 
      The main advantage of ML lies in its ability to deal with many features with 
      complex interactions and its specific focus on maximizing predictive performance. 
      However, emphasis on data-driven prediction can sometimes neglect mechanistic 
      understanding. This article mainly focuses on the application of supervised ML to 
      electronic health record (EHR) data. The main limitation of EHR-based studies is 
      in the difficulty of establishing causal relationships. However, the associated 
      low cost and rich information content provide great potential to uncover hitherto 
      unknown correlations. In this review, the basic concepts of ML are introduced 
      along with important terms that any ML researcher should know. Practical tips 
      regarding the choice of software and computing devices are also provided. Towards 
      the end, several examples of successful ML applications in anesthesiology are 
      discussed. The goal of this article is to provide a basic roadmap to novice ML 
      researchers working in the field of anesthesiology.

TI  - Protocol for the Effectiveness of an Anesthesiology Control Tower System in 
      Improving Perioperative Quality Metrics and Clinical Outcomes: the TECTONICS 
      randomized, pragmatic trial.
PG  - 2032
LID - 10.12688/f1000research.21016.1 [doi]
LID - 2032
AB  - Introduction: Perioperative morbidity is a public health priority, and surgical 
      volume is increasing rapidly. With advances in technology, there is an 
      opportunity to research the utility of a telemedicine-based control center for 
      anesthesia clinicians that assess risk, diagnoses negative patient trajectories, 
      and implements evidence-based practices. Objectives: The primary objective of 
      this trial is to determine whether an anesthesiology control tower (ACT) prevents 
      clinically relevant adverse postoperative outcomes including 30-day mortality, 
      delirium, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. Secondary objectives are 
      to determine whether the ACT improves perioperative quality of care metrics 
      including management of temperature, mean arterial pressure, mean airway pressure 
      with mechanical ventilation, blood glucose, anesthetic concentration, antibiotic 
      redosing, and efficient fresh gas flow. Methods and analysis: We are conducting a 
      single center, randomized, controlled, phase 3 pragmatic clinical trial. A total 
      of 58 operating rooms are randomized daily to receive support from the ACT or 
      not. All adults (eighteen years and older) undergoing surgical procedures in 
      these operating rooms are included and followed until 30 days after their 
      surgery. Clinicians in operating rooms randomized to ACT support receive decision 
      support from clinicians in the ACT. In operating rooms randomized to no 
      intervention, the current standard of anesthesia care is delivered. The 
      intention-to-treat principle will be followed for all analyses. Differences 
      between groups will be presented with 99% confidence intervals; p-values <0.005 
      will be reported as providing compelling evidence, and p-values between 0.05 and 
      0.005 will be reported as providing suggestive evidence. Registration: TECTONICS 
      is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03923699; registered on 23 April 2019.

AB  - Measuring the level of analgesia to adapt the opioids infusion during anesthesia 
      to the real needs of the patient is still a challenge. This is a consequence of 
      the absence of a specific measure capable of quantifying the nociception level of 
      the patients. Unlike existing proposals, this paper aims to evaluate the 
      suitability of the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) as a guidance variable to 
      replicate the decisions made by the experts when a modification of the opioid 
      infusion rate is required. To this end, different machine learning classifiers 
      were trained with several sets of clinical features. Data for training were 
      captured from 17 patients undergoing cholecystectomy surgery. Satisfactory 
      results were obtained when including information about minimum values of ANI for 
      predicting a change of dose. Specifically, a higher efficiency of the Support 
      Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was observed compared with the situation in which 
      the ANI index was not included: accuracy: 86.21% (83.62%-87.93%), precision: 
      86.11% (83.78%-88.57%), recall: 91.18% (88.24%-91.18%), specificity: 79.17% 
      (75%-83.33%), AUC: 0.89 (0.87-0.90) and kappa index: 0.71 (0.66-0.75). The 
      results of this research evidenced that including information about the minimum 
      values of ANI together with the hemodynamic information outperformed the 
      decisions made regarding only non-specific traditional signs such as heart rate 
      and blood pressure. In addition, the analysis of the results showed that 
      including the ANI monitor in the decision making process may anticipate a dose 
      change to prevent hemodynamic events. Finally, the SVM was able to perform 
      accurate predictions when making different decisions commonly observed in the 
      clinical practice.

TI  - Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D 
      transrectal ultrasound images.
PG  - 2413-2426

AB  - PURPOSE: Needle-based procedures for diagnosing and treating prostate cancer, 
      such as biopsy and brachytherapy, have incorporated three-dimensional (3D) 
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging to improve needle guidance. Using these 
      images effectively typically requires the physician to manually segment the 
      prostate to define the margins used for accurate registration, targeting, and 
      other guidance techniques. However, manual prostate segmentation is a 
      time-consuming and difficult intraoperative process, often occurring while the 
      patient is under sedation (biopsy) or anesthetic (brachytherapy). Minimizing 
      procedure time with a 3D TRUS prostate segmentation method could provide 
      physicians with a quick and accurate prostate segmentation, and allow for an 
      efficient workflow with improved patient throughput to enable faster patient 
      access to care. The purpose of this study was to develop a supervised deep 
      learning-based method to segment the prostate in 3D TRUS images from different 
      facilities, generated using multiple acquisition methods and commercial 
      ultrasound machine models to create a generalizable algorithm for needle-based 
      prostate cancer procedures. METHODS: Our proposed method for 3D segmentation 
      involved prediction on two-dimensional (2D) slices sampled radially around the 
      approximate central axis of the prostate, followed by reconstruction into a 3D 
      surface. A 2D U-Net was modified, trained, and validated using images from 84 
      end-fire and 122 side-fire 3D TRUS images acquired during clinical biopsies and 
      brachytherapy procedures. Modifications to the expansion section of the standard 
      U-Net included the addition of 50% dropouts and the use of transpose convolutions 
      instead of standard upsampling followed by convolution to reduce overfitting and 
      improve performance, respectively. Manual contours provided the annotations 
      needed for the training, validation, and testing datasets, with the testing 
      dataset consisting of 20 end-fire and 20 side-fire unseen 3D TRUS images. Since 
      predicting with 2D images has the potential to lose spatial and structural 
      information, comparisons to 3D reconstruction and optimized 3D networks including 
      3D V-Net, Dense V-Net, and High-resolution 3D-Net were performed following an 
      investigation into different loss functions. An extended selection of absolute 
      and signed error metrics were computed, including pixel map comparisons [dice 
      similarity coefficient (DSC), recall, and precision], volume percent differences 
      (VPD), mean surface distance (MSD), and Hausdorff distance (HD), to assess 3D 
      segmentation accuracy. RESULTS: Overall, our proposed reconstructed modified 
      U-Net performed with a median [first quartile, third quartile] absolute DSC, 
      recall, precision, VPD, MSD, and HD of 94.1 [92.6, 94.9]%, 96.0 [93.1, 98.5]%, 
      93.2 [88.8, 95.4]%, 5.78 [2.49, 11.50]%, 0.89 [0.73, 1.09] mm, and 2.89 [2.37, 
      4.35] mm, respectively. When compared to the best-performing optimized 3D network 
      (i.e., 3D V-Net with a Dice plus cross-entropy loss function), our proposed 
      method performed with a significant improvement across nearly all metrics. A 
      computation time <0.7 s per prostate was observed, which is a sufficiently short 
      segmentation time for intraoperative implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed 
      algorithm was able to provide a fast and accurate 3D segmentation across variable 
      3D TRUS prostate images, enabling a generalizable intraoperative solution for 
      needle-based prostate cancer procedures. This method has the potential to 
      decrease procedure times, supporting the increasing interest in needle-based 3D 
      TRUS approaches.

TI  - Comparison of temporomandibular joint function and morphology after surgical and 
      non-surgical treatment in adult condylar head fractures.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether surgical treatment can 
      distinctly improve temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function and morphology in adult 
      patients with condylar head fractures (CHFs) when compared with conservative 
      treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to evaluate 
      surgical and conservative outcomes in all patients who had suffered CHFs. In this 
      study, all patients were divided into a surgical group and a conservative group. 
      In the surgical group patients were treated by open reduction and internal 
      fixation (ORIF) combined disc anchorage, while in the conservative group patients 
      were treated by a removable splint combined with intermaxillary elastics. 
      Clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated and functional outcomes were 
      assessed using the Helkimo index score. Paired t-tests, Wilcoxon signed rank 
      tests, independent t-tests and χ(2) tests were used to assess inter-group 
      differences. RESULTS: 75 TMJs in 56 patients were included in this study and were 
      divided into a surgical group (56 TMJs in 40 patients) and a conservative group 
      (19 TMJs in 16 patients). The results showed that the Helkimo index score for TMJ 
      in the surgical group was better than in the conservative group (p(Ai) = 0.032, 
      p(Di) = 0.001, respectively). Ramus height in the surgical group 
      (61.08 ± 4.04 mm) recovered more than in the conservative group (54.82 ± 3.06 mm) 
      (p = 0.012). Discs became shorter, moved further forward, and became severely 
      distorted in the conservative group (disc length = 7.32 ± 1.35 mm). In contrast, 
      discs became longer, retained a normal disc-condyle relationship, and formed a 
      normal shape in the surgical group (disc length = 11.05 ± 2.07 mm) (p = 0.003). 
      According to the MRI images, joint effusion, retrodiscal tear, and lateral 
      capsular tear were better cured in the surgical group (p = 0.001, p < 0.001, 
      p = 0.012, respectively). CONCLUSION: Based on these results, it seems that 
      surgical treatment of condylar head fractures should be the preferred approach if 
      there are no contraindications for general anesthesia.

TI  - Effect of a Machine Learning-Derived Early Warning System for Intraoperative 
      Hypotension vs Standard Care on Depth and Duration of Intraoperative Hypotension 
      During Elective Noncardiac Surgery: The HYPE Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1052-1060
LID - 10.1001/jama.2020.0592 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Intraoperative hypotension is associated with increased morbidity and 
      mortality. A machine learning-derived early warning system to predict hypotension 
      shortly before it occurs has been developed and validated. OBJECTIVE: To test 
      whether the clinical application of the early warning system in combination with 
      a hemodynamic diagnostic guidance and treatment protocol reduces intraoperative 
      hypotension. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Preliminary unblinded randomized 
      clinical trial performed in a tertiary center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 
      among adult patients scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery under general 
      anesthesia and an indication for continuous invasive blood pressure monitoring, 
      who were enrolled between May 2018 and March 2019. Hypotension was defined as a 
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65 mm Hg for at least 1 minute. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the early warning system 
      (n = 34) or standard care (n = 34), with a goal MAP of at least 65 mm Hg in both 
      groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time-weighted average 
      of hypotension during surgery, with a unit of measure of millimeters of mercury. 
      This was calculated as the depth of hypotension below a MAP of 65 mm Hg (in 
      millimeters of mercury) × time spent below a MAP of 65 mm Hg (in minutes) divided 
      by total duration of operation (in minutes). RESULTS: Among 68 randomized 
      patients, 60 (88%) completed the trial (median age, 64 [interquartile range 
      {IQR}, 57-70] years; 26 [43%] women). The median length of surgery was 256 
      minutes (IQR, 213-430 minutes). The median time-weighted average of hypotension 
      was 0.10 mm Hg (IQR, 0.01-0.43 mm Hg) in the intervention group vs 0.44 mm Hg 
      (IQR, 0.23-0.72 mm Hg) in the control group, for a median difference of 0.38 mm 
      Hg (95% CI, 0.14-0.43 mm Hg; P = .001). The median time of hypotension per 
      patient was 8.0 minutes (IQR, 1.33-26.00 minutes) in the intervention group vs 
      32.7 minutes (IQR, 11.5-59.7 minutes) in the control group, for a median 
      difference of 16.7 minutes (95% CI, 7.7-31.0 minutes; P < .001). In the 
      intervention group, 0 serious adverse events resulting in death occurred vs 2 
      (7%) in the control group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center 
      preliminary study of patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, the use of 
      a machine learning-derived early warning system compared with standard care 
      resulted in less intraoperative hypotension. Further research with larger study 
      populations in diverse settings is needed to understand the effect on additional 
      patient outcomes and to fully assess safety and generalizability. TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Esophageo-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) is an important procedure used 
      for detection and diagnosis of esophago-gastric lesions. There exists no 
      consensus on the technique of examination. AIM: To identify recent advances in 
      diagnostic EGDs to improve diagnostic yield. METHODS: We queried the PubMed 
      database for relevant articles published between January 2001 and August 2019 as 
      well as hand searched references from recently published endoscopy guidelines. 
      Keywords used included free text and MeSH terms addressing quality indicators and 
      technological innovations in EGDs. Factors affecting diagnostic yield and EGD 
      quality were identified and divided into the follow segments: Pre endoscopy 
      preparation, sedation, examination schema, examination time, routine biopsy, 
      image enhanced endoscopy and future developments. RESULTS: We identified 120 
      relevant abstracts of which we utilized 67 of these studies in our review. 
      Adequate pre-endoscopy preparation with simethicone and pronase increases gastric 
      visibility. Proper sedation, especially with propofol, increases patient 
      satisfaction after procedure and may improve detection of superficial 
      gastrointestinal lesions. There is a movement towards mandatory picture 
      documentation during EGD as well as dedicating sufficient time for examination 
      improves diagnostic yield. The use of image enhanced endoscopy and magnifying 
      endoscopy improves detection of squamous cell carcinoma and gastric neoplasm. The 
      magnifying endoscopy simple diagnostic algorithm is useful for diagnosis of early 
      gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: There is a steady momentum in the past decade towards 
      improving diagnostic yield, quality and reporting in EGDs. Other interesting 
      innovations, such as Raman spectroscopy, endocytoscopy and artificial 
      intelligence may have widespread endoscopic applications in the near future.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of using machine learning 
      (ML) technology to predict postoperative recurrence risk among stage IV 
      colorectal cancer patients. Four basic ML algorithms were used for 
      prediction-logistic regression, decision tree, GradientBoosting and lightGBM. The 
      research samples were randomly divided into a training group and a testing group 
      at a ratio of 8:2. 999 patients with stage 4 colorectal cancer were included in 
      this study. In the training group, the GradientBoosting model's AUC value was the 
      highest, at 0.881. The Logistic model's AUC value was the lowest, at 0.734. The 
      GradientBoosting model had the highest F1_score (0.912). In the test group, the 
      AUC Logistic model had the lowest AUC value (0.692). The GradientBoosting model's 
      AUC value was 0.734, which can still predict cancer progress. However, the gbm 
      model had the highest AUC value (0.761), and the gbm model had the highest 
      F1_score (0.974). The GradientBoosting model and the gbm model performed better 
      than the other two algorithms. The weight matrix diagram of the GradientBoosting 
      algorithm shows that chemotherapy, age, LogCEA, CEA and anesthesia time were the 
      five most influential risk factors for tumor recurrence. The four machine 
      learning algorithms can each predict the risk of tumor recurrence in patients 
      with stage IV colorectal cancer after surgery. Among them, GradientBoosting and 
      gbm performed best. Moreover, the GradientBoosting weight matrix shows that the 
      five most influential variables accounting for postoperative tumor recurrence are 
      chemotherapy, age, LogCEA, CEA and anesthesia time.

TI  - MRI Techniques to Decrease Imaging Times in Children.
PG  - 485-502
LID - 10.1148/rg.2020190112 [doi]
AB  - Long acquisition times can limit the use of MRI in pediatric patients, and the 
      use of sedation or general anesthesia is frequently necessary to facilitate 
      diagnostic examinations. The use of sedation or anesthesia has disadvantages 
      including increased cost and imaging time and potential risks to the patient. 
      Reductions in imaging time may decrease or eliminate the need for sedation or 
      general anesthesia. Over the past decade, a number of imaging techniques that can 
      decrease imaging time have become commercially available. These products have 
      been used increasingly in clinical practice and include parallel imaging, 
      simultaneous multisection imaging, radial k-space acquisition, compressed sensing 
      MRI reconstruction, and automated protocol selection software. The underlying 
      concepts, supporting data, current clinical applications, and available products 
      for each of these strategies are reviewed in this article. In addition, emerging 
      techniques that are still under investigation may provide further reductions in 
      imaging time, including artificial intelligence-based reconstruction, 
      gradient-controlled aliasing sampling and reconstruction, three-dimensional MR 
      spectroscopy, and prospective motion correction. The preliminary results for 
      these techniques are also discussed. (©)RSNA, 2020 See discussion on this article

TI  - Classification of Current Procedural Terminology Codes from Electronic Health 
      Record Data Using Machine Learning.
PG  - 738-749
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000003150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate anesthesiology procedure code data are essential to quality 
      improvement, research, and reimbursement tasks within anesthesiology practices. 
      Advanced data science techniques, including machine learning and natural language 
      processing, offer opportunities to develop classification tools for Current 
      Procedural Terminology codes across anesthesia procedures. METHODS: Models were 
      created using a Train/Test dataset including 1,164,343 procedures from 16 
      academic and private hospitals. Five supervised machine learning models were 
      created to classify anesthesiology Current Procedural Terminology codes, with 
      accuracy defined as first choice classification matching the 
      institutional-assigned code existing in the perioperative database. The two best 
      performing models were further refined and tested on a Holdout dataset from a 
      single institution distinct from Train/Test. A tunable confidence parameter was 
      created to identify cases for which models were highly accurate, with the goal of 
      at least 95% accuracy, above the reported 2018 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
      Services (Baltimore, Maryland) fee-for-service accuracy. Actual submitted claim 
      data from billing specialists were used as a reference standard. RESULTS: Support 
      vector machine and neural network label-embedding attentive models were the best 
      performing models, respectively, demonstrating overall accuracies of 87.9% and 
      84.2% (single best code), and 96.8% and 94.0% (within top three). Classification 
      accuracy was 96.4% in 47.0% of cases using support vector machine and 94.4% in 
      62.2% of cases using label-embedding attentive model within the Train/Test 
      dataset. In the Holdout dataset, respective classification accuracies were 93.1% 
      in 58.0% of cases and 95.0% among 62.0%. The most important feature in model 
      training was procedure text. CONCLUSIONS: Through application of machine learning 
      and natural language processing techniques, highly accurate real-time models were 
      created for anesthesiology Current Procedural Terminology code classification. 
      The increased processing speed and a priori targeted accuracy of this 
      classification approach may provide performance optimization and cost reduction 
      for quality improvement, research, and reimbursement tasks reliant on 
      anesthesiology procedure codes.

TI  - Performance of the Hypotension Prediction Index with non-invasive arterial 
      pressure waveforms in non-cardiac surgical patients.
PG  - 71-78
LID - 10.1007/s10877-020-00463-5 [doi]
AB  - An algorithm derived from machine learning uses the arterial waveform to predict 
      intraoperative hypotension some minutes before episodes, possibly giving 
      clinician's time to intervene and prevent hypotension. Whether the Hypotension 
      Prediction Index works well with noninvasive arterial pressure waveforms remains 
      unknown. We therefore evaluated sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive 
      value of the Index based on non-invasive arterial waveform estimates. We used 
      continuous hemodynamic data measured from ClearSight (formerly Nexfin) 
      noninvasive finger blood pressure monitors in surgical patients. We re-evaluated 
      data from a trial that included 320 adults ≥ 45 years old designated ASA physical 
      status 3 or 4 who had moderate-to-high-risk non-cardiac surgery with general 
      anesthesia. We calculated sensitivity and specificity for predicting hypotension, 
      defined as mean arterial pressure ≤ 65 mmHg for at least 1 min, and characterized 
      the relationship with receiver operating characteristics curves. We also 
      evaluated the number of hypotensive events at various ranges of the Hypotension 
      Prediction Index. And finally, we calculated the positive predictive value for 
      hypotension episodes when the Prediction Index threshold was 85. The algorithm 
      predicted hypotension 5 min in advance, with a sensitivity of 0.86 [95% 
      confidence interval 0.82, 0.89] and specificity 0.86 [0.82, 0.89]. At 10 min, the 
      sensitivity was 0.83 [0.79, 0.86] and the specificity was 0.83 [0.79, 0.86]. And 
      at 15 min, the sensitivity was 0.75 [0.71, 0.80] and the specificity was 0.75 
      [0.71, 0.80]. The positive predictive value of the algorithm prediction at an 
      Index threshold of 85 was 0.83 [0.79, 0.87]. A Hypotension Prediction Index of 
      80-89 provided a median of 6.0 [95% confidence interval 5.3, 6.7] minutes warning 
      before mean arterial pressure decreased to < 65 mmHg. The Hypotension Prediction 
      Index, which was developed and validated with invasive arterial waveforms, 
      predicts intraoperative hypotension reasonably well from non-invasive estimates 
      of the arterial waveform. Hypotension prediction, along with appropriate 
      management, can potentially reduce intraoperative hypotension. Being able to use 
      the non-invasive pressure waveform will widen the range of patients who might 
      benefit.Clinical Trial Number: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02872896.

TI  - Comparison of intraoperative cortisol levels after preoperative hydrocortisone 
      administration versus placebo in patients without adrenal insufficiency 
      undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal removal of nonfunctioning pituitary 
      adenomas: a double-blind randomized trial.
PG  - 526-534
LID - 10.3171/2019.11.JNS192381 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this double-blind randomized trial, the necessity of preoperative 
      steroid administration in patients without adrenal insufficiency (AI) undergoing 
      endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (ETSS) for pituitary adenoma was evaluated. 
      METHODS: Forty patients with and without AI, defined as a peak cortisol level > 
      18 µg/dl on the insulin tolerance test or rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone 
      (ACTH) test, undergoing ETSS for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas were randomly 
      allocated to treatment with either 100 mg of preoperative hydrocortisone (group 
      HC, n = 20) or normal saline (group C, n = 20). The patients with pituitary 
      apoplexy, the use of a drug within the last 3 months that could affect the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or a previous history of brain or adrenal 
      surgery were excluded. Intraoperative cortisol and ACTH levels were measured 
      after anesthesia induction, dura incision, and tumor removal, and at the end of 
      surgery. Intraoperative hypotension, early postoperative AI, and postoperative 
      3-month pituitary function were investigated. RESULTS: Intraoperative serum 
      cortisol levels were significantly higher in the HC group than in the C group 
      after anesthesia induction (median 69.0 µg/dl [IQR 62.2-89.6 µg/dl] vs 12.7 µg/dl 
      [IQR 8.4-18.2 µg/dl], median difference 57.5 µg/dl [95% CI 33.0-172.9 µg/dl]), 
      after dura incision (median 53.2 µg/dl [IQR 44.9-63.8 µg/dl] vs 6.4 [IQR 4.8-9.2 
      µg/dl], median difference 46.6 µg/dl [95% CI 13.3-89.2 µg/dl]), after tumor 
      removal (median 49.5 µg/dl [IQR 43.6-62.4 µg/dl] vs 9.2 µg/dl [IQR 5.75-16.7 
      µg/dl], median difference 39.4 µg/dl [95% CI 0.3-78.1 µg/dl]), and at the end of 
      surgery (median 46.9 µg/dl [IQR 40.1-63.4 µg/dl] vs 16.9 µg/dl [IQR 12.1-23.2 
      µg/dl], median difference 32.2 µg/dl [95% CI -42.0 to 228.1 µg/dl]). Serum ACTH 
      levels were significantly lower in group HC than in group C after anesthesia 
      induction (median 3.9 pmol/L [IQR 1.7-5.2 pmol/L] vs 6.9 pmol/L [IQR 3.9-11.9 
      pmol/L], p = 0.007). No patient showed intraoperative hypotension due to AI. 
      Early postoperative AI was observed in 3 and 5 patients in groups HC and C, 
      respectively. The postoperative 3-month pituitary hormone outcomes including ACTH 
      deficiency were not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative steroid 
      administration may be unnecessary in patients without AI undergoing ETSS for 
      nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. However, a further large-scale study is needed 
      to determine whether preoperative steroid administration has a significant impact 
      on clinically meaningful events such as perioperative AI and postoperative 
      3-month ACTH deficiency in these patients.Korean Clinical Trial Registry no.:

AB  - Artificial intelligence has been advancing in fields including anesthesiology. 
      This scoping review of the intersection of artificial intelligence and anesthesia 
      research identified and summarized six themes of applications of artificial 
      intelligence in anesthesiology: (1) depth of anesthesia monitoring, (2) control 
      of anesthesia, (3) event and risk prediction, (4) ultrasound guidance, (5) pain 
      management, and (6) operating room logistics. Based on papers identified in the 
      review, several topics within artificial intelligence were described and 
      summarized: (1) machine learning (including supervised, unsupervised, and 
      reinforcement learning), (2) techniques in artificial intelligence (e.g., 
      classical machine learning, neural networks and deep learning, Bayesian methods), 
      and (3) major applied fields in artificial intelligence.The implications of 
      artificial intelligence for the practicing anesthesiologist are discussed as are 
      its limitations and the role of clinicians in further developing artificial 
      intelligence for use in clinical care. Artificial intelligence has the potential 
      to impact the practice of anesthesiology in aspects ranging from perioperative 
      support to critical care delivery to outpatient pain management.

AB  - As exponential expansion of computing capacity converges with unsustainable 
      health care spending, a hopeful opportunity has emerged: the use of artificial 
      intelligence to enhance health care quality and safety. These computer-based 
      algorithms can perform the intricate and extremely complex mathematical 
      operations of classification or regression on immense amounts of data to detect 
      intricate and potentially previously unknown patterns in that data, with the end 
      result of creating predictive models that can be utilized in clinical practice. 
      Such models are designed to distinguish relevant from irrelevant data regarding a 
      particular patient; choose appropriate perioperative care, intervention or 
      surgery; predict cost of care and reimbursement; and predict future outcomes on a 
      variety of anchored measures. If and when one is brought to fruition, an 
      artificial intelligence platform could serve as the first legitimate clinical 
      decision-making tool in spine care, delivering on the value equation while 
      serving as a source for improving physician performance and promoting 
      appropriate, efficient care in this era of financial uncertainty in health care.

PG  - 44
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1481-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, is 
      increasing in medicine. Use of machine learning is rising in the prediction of 
      patient outcomes. Machine learning may also be able to enhance and augment 
      anesthesia clinical procedures such as airway management. In this study, we 
      sought to develop a machine learning algorithm that could classify vocal cords 
      and tracheal airway anatomy real-time during video laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy 
      as well as compare the performance of three novel convolutional networks for 
      detecting vocal cords and tracheal rings. METHODS: Following institutional 
      approval, a clinical dataset of 775 video laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy videos 
      was used. The dataset was divided into two categories for use for training and 
      testing. We used three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNet, Inception 
      and MobileNet. Backpropagation and a mean squared error loss function were used 
      to assess accuracy as well as minimize bias and variance. Following training, we 
      assessed transferability using the generalization error of the CNN, sensitivity 
      and specificity, average confidence error, outliers, overall confidence 
      percentage, and frames per second for live video feeds. After the training was 
      complete, 22 models using 0 to 25,000 steps were generated and compared. RESULTS: 
      The overall confidence of classification for the vocal cords and tracheal rings 
      for ResNet, Inception and MobileNet CNNs were as follows: 0.84, 0.78, and 0.64 
      for vocal cords, respectively, and 0.69, 0.72, 0.54 for tracheal rings, 
      respectively. Transfer learning following additional training resulted in 
      improved accuracy of ResNet and Inception for identifying the vocal cords (with a 
      confidence of 0.96 and 0.93 respectively). The two best performing CNNs, ResNet 
      and Inception, achieved a specificity of 0.985 and 0.971, respectively, and a 
      sensitivity of 0.865 and 0.892, respectively. Inception was able to process the 
      live video feeds at 10 FPS while ResNet processed at 5 FPS. Both were able to 
      pass a feasibility test of identifying vocal cords and tracheal rings in a video 
      feed. CONCLUSIONS: We report the development and evaluation of a CNN that can 
      identify and classify airway anatomy in real time. This neural network 
      demonstrates high performance. The availability of artificial intelligence may 
      improve airway management and bronchoscopy by helping to identify key anatomy 
      real time. Thus, potentially improving performance and outcomes during these 
      procedures. Further, this technology may theoretically be extended to the 
      settings of airway pathology or airway management in the hands of experienced 
      providers. The researchers in this study are exploring the performance of this 
      neural network in clinical trials.

AB  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly expanding fields with 
      increasing relevance in anesthesia and, in particular, airway management. The 
      ability of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to recognize 
      patterns from large volumes of complex data makes them attractive for use in 
      pediatric anesthesia airway management. The purpose of this review is to 
      introduce artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning to the 
      pediatric anesthesiologist. Current evidence and developments in artificial 
      intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning relevant to pediatric airway 
      management are presented. We critically assess the current evidence on the use of 
      artificial intelligence and machine learning in the assessment, diagnosis, 
      monitoring, procedure assistance, and predicting outcomes during pediatric airway 
      management. Further, we discuss the limitations of these technologies and offer 
      areas for focused research that may bring pediatric airway management 
      anesthesiology into the era of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Pain from Facial Expressions: A Survey.
PG  - 1815-1831
LID - 10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2958341 [doi]
AB  - Pain sensation is essential for survival, since it draws attention to physical 
      threat to the body. Pain assessment is usually done through self-reports. 
      However, self-assessment of pain is not available in the case of noncommunicative 
      patients, and therefore, observer reports should be relied upon. Observer reports 
      of pain could be prone to errors due to subjective biases of observers. Moreover, 
      continuous monitoring by humans is impractical. Therefore, automatic pain 
      detection technology could be deployed to assist human caregivers and complement 
      their service, thereby improving the quality of pain management, especially for 
      noncommunicative patients. Facial expressions are a reliable indicator of pain, 
      and are used in all observer-based pain assessment tools. Following the 
      advancements in automatic facial expression analysis, computer vision researchers 
      have tried to use this technology for developing approaches for automatically 
      detecting pain from facial expressions. This paper surveys the literature 
      published in this field over the past decade, categorizes it, and identifies 
      future research directions. The survey covers the pain datasets used in the 
      reviewed literature, the learning tasks targeted by the approaches, the features 
      extracted from images and image sequences to represent pain-related information, 
      and finally, the machine learning methods used.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence: A New Tool in Operating Room Management. Role of Machine 
      Learning Models in Operating Room Optimization.
PG  - 20
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1512-1 [doi]
AB  - We conducted a systematic review of literature to better understand the role of 
      new technologies in the perioperative period; in particular we focus on the 
      administrative and managerial Operating Room (OR) perspective. Studies conducted 
      on adult (≥ 18 years) patients between 2015 and February 2019 were deemed 
      eligible. A total of 19 papers were included. Our review suggests that the use of 
      Machine Learning (ML) in the field of OR organization has many potentials. 
      Predictions of the surgical case duration were obtain with a good performance; 
      their use could therefore allow a more precise scheduling, limiting waste of 
      resources. ML is able to support even more complex models, which can coordinate 
      multiple spaces simultaneously, as in the case of the post-anesthesia care unit 
      and operating rooms. Types of Artificial Intelligence could also be used to limit 
      another organizational problem, which has important economic repercussions: 
      cancellation. Random Forest has proven effective in identifing surgeries with 
      high risks of cancellation, allowing to plan preventive measures to reduce the 
      cancellation rate accordingly. In conclusion, although data in literature are 
      still limited, we believe that ML has great potential in the field of OR 
      organization; however, further studies are needed to assess the effective role of 
      these new technologies in the perioperative medicine.

TI  - Study on miR-384-5p activates TGF-β signaling pathway to promote neuronal damage 
      in abutment nucleus of rats based on deep learning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Any ailment in our organs can be visualized by using different 
      modality signals and images. Hospitals are encountering a massive influx of large 
      multimodality patient data to be analysed accurately and with context 
      understanding. The deep learning techniques, like convolution neural networks 
      (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoencoders, deep generative models and 
      deep belief networks have already been applied to efficiently analyse possible 
      large collections of data. Application of these methods to medical signals and 
      images can aid the clinicians in clinical decision making. PURPOSE: The aim of 
      this study was to explore its potential application mechanism to the abalone 
      basal ganglia neurons in rats based on deep learning. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Firstly, in the GEO database, we obtained data on rat anesthesia, performing 
      differential analysis, co-expression analysis, and enrichment analysis, and then 
      we received the relevant module genes. Besides, the potential regulation of 
      multi-factors on the module was calculated by hypergeometric test, and a series 
      of ncRNA and TF were identified. Finally, we screened the target genes of 
      anesthetized rats to gain insight into the potential role of anesthesia in rat 
      basal lateral nucleus neurons. RESULTS: A total of 535 differentially expressed 
      genes in rats were obtained, involving Mafb and Ryr2. These genes are clustered 
      into 17 anesthesia-related expression disorder modules. At the same time, the 
      biological processes favored by the module are regulation of neuron apoptotic 
      process and transforming growth factor beta2 production. Pivot analysis found 
      that 39 ncRNAs and 4 TFs drive anesthesia-related disorders. Finally, the 
      mechanism of action was analyzed and predicted. The module was regulated by 
      Acvr1. We believe that miR-384-5p in anesthetized rats can activate the TGF-beta 
      signaling pathway. Further, it promotes anesthesia and causes exposure to the 
      basal ganglia neuron damage of the amygdala. CONCLUSION: In this study, the 
      imbalance module was used to explore the multi-factor-mediated anesthesia 
      application mechanism, which provided new methods and ideas for subsequent 
      research. The results suggest that miR-384-5p can promote anesthesia damage to 
      the abalone basal ganglia neurons in rats through a variety of biological 
      processes and signaling pathways. This result lays a solid theoretical foundation 
      for biologists to explore the application mechanism of anesthesiology further.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Technologies for Coping with Alarm Fatigue in Hospital 
      Environments Because of Sensory Overload: Algorithm Development and Validation.
PG  - e15406
LID - 10.2196/15406 [doi]
LID - e15406
AB  - BACKGROUND: Informed estimates claim that 80% to 99% of alarms set off in 
      hospital units are false or clinically insignificant, representing a cacophony of 
      sounds that do not present a real danger to patients. These false alarms can lead 
      to an alert overload that causes a health care provider to miss important events 
      that could be harmful or even life-threatening. As health care units become more 
      dependent on monitoring devices for patient care purposes, the alarm fatigue 
      issue has to be addressed as a major concern for the health care team as well as 
      to enhance patient safety. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this paper was to propose 
      a feasible solution for the alarm fatigue problem by using an automatic reasoning 
      mechanism to decide how to notify members of the health care team. The aim was to 
      reduce the number of notifications sent by determining whether or not to group a 
      set of alarms that occur over a short period of time to deliver them together, 
      without compromising patient safety. METHODS: This paper describes: (1) a model 
      for supporting reasoning algorithms that decide how to notify caregivers to avoid 
      alarm fatigue; (2) an architecture for health systems that support patient 
      monitoring and notification capabilities; and (3) a reasoning algorithm that 
      specifies how to notify caregivers by deciding whether to aggregate a group of 
      alarms to avoid alarm fatigue. RESULTS: Experiments were used to demonstrate that 
      providing a reasoning system can reduce the notifications received by the 
      caregivers by up to 99.3% (582/586) of the total alarms generated. Our 
      experiments were evaluated through the use of a dataset comprising patient 
      monitoring data and vital signs recorded during 32 surgical cases where patients 
      underwent anesthesia at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. We present the results of 
      our algorithm by using graphs we generated using the R language, where we show 
      whether the algorithm decided to deliver an alarm immediately or after a delay. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results strongly suggest that this reasoning 
      algorithm is a useful strategy for avoiding alarm fatigue. Although we evaluated 
      our algorithm in an experimental environment, we tried to reproduce the context 
      of a clinical environment by using real-world patient data. Our future work is to 
      reproduce the evaluation study based on more realistic clinical conditions by 
      increasing the number of patients, monitoring parameters, and types of alarm.

TI  - Quantification of Head Shape from Three-Dimensional Photography for Presurgical 
      and Postsurgical Evaluation of Craniosynostosis.
PG  - 1051e-1060e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000006260 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of surgical treatment for craniosynostosis is typically 
      based on subjective visual assessment or simple clinical metrics of cranial shape 
      that are prone to interobserver variability. Three-dimensional photography 
      provides cheap and noninvasive information to assess surgical outcomes, but there 
      are no clinical tools to analyze it. The authors aim to objectively and 
      automatically quantify head shape from three-dimensional photography. METHODS: 
      The authors present an automatic method to quantify intuitive metrics of local 
      head shape from three-dimensional photography using a normative statistical head 
      shape model built from 201 subjects. The authors use these metrics together with 
      a machine learning classifier to distinguish between patients with (n = 266) and 
      without (n = 201) craniosynostosis (aged 0 to 6 years). The authors also use 
      their algorithms to quantify objectively local surgical head shape improvements 
      on 18 patients with presurgical and postsurgical three-dimensional photographs. 
      RESULTS: The authors' methods detected craniosynostosis automatically with 94.74 
      percent sensitivity and 96.02 percent specificity. Within the data set of 
      patients with craniosynostosis, the authors identified correctly the fused 
      sutures with 99.51 percent sensitivity and 99.13 percent specificity. When the 
      authors compared quantitatively the presurgical and postsurgical head shapes of 
      patients with craniosynostosis, they obtained a significant reduction of head 
      shape abnormalities (p < 0.05), in agreement with the treatment approach and the 
      clinical observations. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative head shape analysis and 
      three-dimensional photography provide an accurate and objective tool to screen 
      for head shape abnormalities at low cost and avoiding imaging with radiation 
      and/or sedation. The authors' automatic quantitative framework allows for the 
      evaluation of surgical outcomes and has the potential to detect relapses.

AB  - Background: Chronic pain is a prevalent and dynamic condition for both patients 
      and providers. Learning how patients with chronic pain successfully manage their 
      pain may prove helpful in guiding health care providers in their treatment of 
      other patients with chronic pain. This research sought to identify successful 
      strategies for managing chronic pain from interviews with individuals 
      experiencing chronic pain who were able to do "most of what they want on most 
      days." Methods: Qualitative, descriptive study. Patients were from metro Denver, 
      Colorado, USA and were recruited from community and health care settings. 
      Appreciative inquiry (AI) was used as an approach to elicit stories of successful 
      pain management. We conducted one-on-one, in person interviews using a 
      semistructured interview guide. Analysis was completed using a grounded 
      hermeneutic editing approach. Results: Twenty-four interviews were completed 
      representing a range of adult ages, genders, race/ethnicities, and underlying 
      reasons for chronic pain. Consistent themes were found in that all patients had 
      developed multiple strategies for ongoing pain management and prevention, as well 
      as a mental approach embedded with elements of positive beliefs and 
      determination. Friends, family, support group members, and health care providers 
      were key in support and ongoing management. Although 10 patients regularly used 
      opioid pain medications, none were dependent, and all stated an active desire to 
      avoid these medications. Conclusions: Successful chronic pain management seems 
      possible as displayed from the patient narratives but requires persistence 
      through individual trial and error. Recommendations for health care provider 
      teams are made to apply these findings to assist patients with chronic pain.

TI  - Quantification of hepatic steatosis in histologic images by deep learning method.
PG  - 1033-1045
LID - 10.3233/XST-190570 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and test a novel method for automatic quantification of 
      hepatic steatosis in histologic images based on the deep learning scheme designed 
      to predict the fat ratio directly, which aims to improve accuracy in diagnosis of 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with objective assessment of the 
      severity of hepatic steatosis instead of subjective visual estimation. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Thirty-six 8-week old New Zealand white rabbits of both sexes were 
      fed with high-cholesterol, high-fat diet and sacrificed under deep anesthesia at 
      various time points to obtain the pathological specimen. All rabbits were 
      performed by multislice computed tomography for surveillance to measure density 
      changes of liver parenchyma. A deep learning scheme using a convolutional neural 
      network was developed to directly predict the liver fat ratio based on the 
      pathological images. The average error value, standard deviation, and accuracy 
      (error <5%) were evaluated and compared between the deep learning scheme and 
      manual segmentation results. The Pearson's correlation coefficient was also 
      calculated in this study. RESULTS: The deep learning scheme performs successfully 
      on rabbit liver histologic data, showing a high degree of accuracy and stability. 
      The average error value, standard deviation, and accuracy (error <5%) were 3.21%, 
      4.02%, and 79.10% for the cropped images, 2.22%, 1.92%, and 88.34% for the 
      original images, respectively. The strong positive correlation was also observed 
      for cropped images (R = 0.9227) and original images (R = 0.9255) in comparison to 
      labeled fat ratio. CONCLUSIONS: This new deep learning scheme may aid in the 
      quantification of steatosis in the liver and facilitate its treatment by 
      providing an earlier clinical diagnosis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of body weight, oxytocin 
      deposition in the uterus at artificial insemination (AI), vaginal cytology, serum 
      progesterone (P(4)) concentration at AI, semen volume and total sperm cells per 
      AI on whelping rate and litter size of English Bulldogs bitches following 
      intrauterine surgical semen deposition. Seventy-eight English Bulldog bitches 
      were artificially inseminated via semen infusion (number of sperm cells 
      inseminated 300-2500 × 10(6)) at the uterine body with fresh semen without 
      extender and under general anesthesia. Whelping rate was greater (P < 0.05) in 
      bitches with >23 kg than bitches with <23 kg (83.9 vs 63.8%). Whelping rate was 
      greater (P < 0.01) in bitches with >75% vaginal cornified epithelium at AI 
      (85.1%) than animals with <75% cornified epithelium (51.6%). Whelping rates were 
      influenced (P < 0.01) by the semen volume at AI (54.3% vs 86.1% for bitches 
      receiving <4 mL or >4 mL of semen). Litter size was larger (P < 0.05) in bitches 
      >23 kg than lighter animals (3.72 ± 1.79 and 2.30 ± 1.46 pups per litter, 
      respectively). Litter size was not influenced by sperm concentration, semen 
      volume, vaginal cytology, serum P(4) concentration and infusion of oxytocin in 
      the uterus at AI (P > 0.1). The results of this study indicate that increasing 
      body weight of English Bulldog bitches is related to higher whelping rates and 
      larger litter size. Also, >75% of superficial cornified vaginal cells (squamous) 
      at AI and >4 mL semen volume maximize whelping rates in this breed of dogs.

      stimulation surgery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the internal segment of the globus 
      pallidus (GPi) in patients with Parkinson's disease and dystonia improves motor 
      symptoms and quality of life. Traditionally, pallidal borders have been 
      demarcated by electrophysiological microelectrode recordings (MERs) during DBS 
      surgery. However, detection of pallidal borders can be challenging due to the 
      variability of the firing characteristics of neurons encountered along the 
      trajectory. MER can also be time-consuming and therefore costly. Here we show the 
      feasibility of real-time machine learning classification of striato-pallidal 
      borders to assist neurosurgeons during DBS surgery. APPROACH: An 
      electrophysiological dataset from 116 trajectories of 42 patients consisting of 
      11 774 MER segments of background spiking activity in five classes of disease was 
      used to train the classification algorithm. The five classes included awake 
      Parkinson's disease patients, as well as awake and lightly anesthetized genetic 
      and non-genetic dystonia patients. A machine learning algorithm was designed to 
      provide prediction of the striato-pallidal borders, based on hidden Markov models 
      (HMMs) and the L(1)-distance measure in normalized root mean square (NRMS) and 
      power spectra of the MER. We tested its performance prospectively against the 
      judgment of three electrophysiologists in the operating rooms of three hospitals 
      using newly collected data. MAIN RESULTS: The awake and the light anesthesia 
      dystonia classes could be merged. Using MER NRMS and spectra, the machine 
      learning algorithm was on par with the performance of the three 
      electrophysiologists across the striatum-GPe, GPe-GPi, and GPi-exit transitions 
      for all disease classes. SIGNIFICANCE: Machine learning algorithms enable 
      real-time GPi navigation systems to potentially shorten the duration of 
      electrophysiological mapping of pallidal borders, while ensuring correct pallidal 
      border detection.

AB  - Determining the level of consciousness in patients with disorders of 
      consciousness (DOC) remains challenging. To address this challenge, resting-state 
      fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been widely used for detecting the local, regional, and 
      network activity differences between DOC patients and healthy controls. Although 
      substantial progress has been made towards this endeavor, the identification of 
      robust rs-fMRI-based biomarkers for level of consciousness is still lacking. 
      Recent developments in machine learning show promise as a tool to augment the 
      discrimination between different states of consciousness in clinical practice. 
      Here, we investigated whether machine learning models trained to make a binary 
      distinction between conscious wakefulness and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness 
      would then be capable of reliably identifying pathologically induced 
      unconsciousness. We did so by extracting rs-fMRI-based features associated with 
      local activity, regional homogeneity, and interregional functional activity in 44 
      subjects during wakefulness, light sedation, and unresponsiveness (deep sedation 
      and general anesthesia), and subsequently using those features to train three 
      distinct candidate machine learning classifiers: support vector machine, Extra 
      Trees, artificial neural network. First, we show that all three classifiers 
      achieve reliable performance within-dataset (via nested cross-validation), with a 
      mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95, 0.92, 
      and 0.94, respectively. Additionally, we observed comparable cross-dataset 
      performance (making predictions on the DOC data) as the anesthesia-trained 
      classifiers demonstrated a consistent ability to discriminate between 
      unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS/VS) patients and healthy controls with 
      mean AUC's of 0.99, 0.94, 0.98, respectively. Lastly, we explored the potential 
      of applying the aforementioned classifiers towards discriminating intermediate 
      states of consciousness, specifically, subjects under light anesthetic sedation 
      and patients diagnosed as having a minimally conscious state (MCS). Our findings 
      demonstrate that machine learning classifiers trained on rs-fMRI features derived 
      from participants under anesthesia have potential to aid the discrimination 
      between degrees of pathological unconsciousness in clinical patients.

AB  - Precise cerebral dynamics of action of the anesthetics are a challenge for 
      neuroscientists. This explains why there is no gold standard for monitoring the 
      Depth of Anesthesia (DoA) and why experimental studies may use several 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, ranging from 2 to 128 EEG-channels. Our 
      study aimed at finding the scalp area providing valuable information about brain 
      activity under general anesthesia (GA) to select the more optimal EEG channel to 
      characterized the DoA. We included 30 patients undergoing elective, minor surgery 
      under GA and used a 32-channel EEG to record their electrical brain activity. In 
      addition, we recorded their physiological parameters and the BIS monitor. Each 
      individual EEG channel data were processed to test their ability to differentiate 
      awake from asleep states. Due to strict quality criteria adopted for the EEG data 
      and the difficulties of the real-life setting of the study, only 8 patients 
      recordings were taken into consideration in the final analysis. Using 2 
      classification algorithms, we identified the optimal channels to discriminate 
      between asleep and awake states: the frontal and temporal F8 and T7 were 
      retrieved as being the two bests channels to monitor DoA. Then, using only data 
      from the F8 channel, we tried to minimize the number of features required to 
      discriminate between the awake and asleep state. The best algorithm turned out to 
      be the Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) requiring only 5 features (Area Under the ROC 
      Curve - AUC- of 0.93 ± 0.04). This finding may pave the way to improve the 
      assessment of DoA by combining one EEG channel recordings with a multimodal 
      physiological monitoring of the brain state under GA. Further work is needed to 
      see if these results may be valid to asses the depth of sedation in ICU.

TI  - The use of a machine-learning algorithm that predicts hypotension during surgery 
      in combination with personalized treatment guidance: study protocol for a 
      randomized clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraoperative hypotension is associated with increased morbidity and 
      mortality. Current treatment is mostly reactive. The Hypotension Prediction Index 
      (HPI) algorithm is able to predict hypotension minutes before the blood pressure 
      actually decreases. Internal and external validation of this algorithm has shown 
      good sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that the use of this algorithm 
      in combination with a personalized treatment protocol will reduce the time 
      weighted average (TWA) in hypotension during surgery spent in hypotension 
      intraoperatively. METHODS/DESIGN: We aim to include 100 adult patients undergoing 
      non-cardiac surgery with an anticipated duration of more than 2 h, necessitating 
      the use of an arterial line, and an intraoperatively targeted mean arterial 
      pressure (MAP) of > 65 mmHg. This study is divided into two parts; in phase A 
      baseline TWA data from 40 patients will be collected prospectively. A device 
      (HemoSphere) with HPI software will be connected but fully covered. Phase B is 
      designed as a single-center, randomized controlled trial were 60 patients will be 
      randomized with computer-generated blocks of four, six or eight, with an 
      allocation ratio of 1:1. In the intervention arm the HemoSphere with HPI will be 
      used to guide treatment; in the control arm the HemoSphere with HPI software will 
      be connected but fully covered. The primary outcome is the TWA in hypotension 
      during surgery. DISCUSSION: The aim of this trial is to explore whether the use 
      of a machine-learning algorithm intraoperatively can result in less hypotension. 
      To test this, the treating anesthesiologist will need to change treatment 
      behavior from reactive to proactive. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been 
      registered with the NIH, U.S. National Library of Medicine at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      ID: NCT03376347 . The trial was submitted on 4 November 2017 and accepted for 
      registration on 18 December 2017.

AB  - Could an overly deep sedation be anticipated from ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) 
      patterns? We report here motifs hidden in the EEG signal that predict the 
      appearance of Iso-Electric Suppressions (IES), observed during epileptic 
      encephalopathies, drug intoxications, comatose, brain death or during anesthetic 
      over-dosage that are considered to be detrimental. To show that IES occurrences 
      can be predicted from EEG traces dynamics, we focus on transient suppression of 
      the alpha rhythm (8-14 Hz) recorded for 80 patients, that had a Propofol target 
      controlled infusion of 5 μg/ml during a general anesthesia. We found that the 
      first time of appearance as well as changes in duration of these 
      Alpha-Suppressions (αS) are two parameters that anticipate the appearance of IES. 
      Using machine learning, we predicted IES appearance from the first 10 min of EEG 
      (AUC of 0.93). To conclude, transient motifs in the alpha rhythm predict IES 
      during anesthesia and can be used to identify patients, with higher risks of 
      post-operative complications.

      using deep learning.

AB  - Over- and under-sedation are common in the ICU, and contribute to poor ICU 
      outcomes including delirium. Behavioral assessments, such as Richmond 
      Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) for monitoring levels of sedation and Confusion 
      Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for detecting signs of delirium, are 
      often used. As an alternative, brain monitoring with electroencephalography (EEG) 
      has been proposed in the operating room, but is challenging to implement in ICU 
      due to the differences between critical illness and elective surgery, as well as 
      the duration of sedation. Here we present a deep learning model based on a 
      combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks that automatically 
      tracks both the level of consciousness and delirium using frontal EEG signals in 
      the ICU. For level of consciousness, the system achieves a median accuracy of 70% 
      when allowing prediction to be within one RASS level difference across all 
      patients, which is comparable or higher than the median technician-nurse 
      agreement at 59%. For delirium, the system achieves an AUC of 0.80 with 69% 
      sensitivity and 83% specificity at the optimal operating point. The results show 
      it is feasible to continuously track level of consciousness and delirium in the 
      ICU.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Stroke Volume Estimation Outperforms Conventional Arterial 
      Contour Method in Patients with Hemodynamic Instability.
LID - 10.3390/jcm8091419 [doi]
LID - 1419
AB  - Although the stroke volume (SV) estimation by arterial blood pressure has been 
      widely used in clinical practice, its accuracy is questionable, especially during 
      periods of hemodynamic instability. We aimed to create novel SV estimating model 
      based on deep-learning (DL) method. A convolutional neural network was applied to 
      estimate SV from arterial blood pressure waveform data recorded from liver 
      transplantation (LT) surgeries. The model was trained using a gold standard 
      referential SV measured via pulmonary artery thermodilution method. Merging a 
      gold standard SV and corresponding 10.24 seconds of arterial blood pressure 
      waveform as an input/output data set with 2-senconds of sliding overlap, 484,384 
      data sets from 34 LT surgeries were used for training and validation of DL model. 
      The performance of DL model was evaluated by correlation and concordance analyses 
      in another 491,353 data sets from 31 LT surgeries. We also evaluated the 
      performance of pre-existing commercialized model (EV1000), and the performance 
      results of DL model and EV1000 were compared. The DL model provided an acceptable 
      performance throughout the surgery (r = 0.813, concordance rate = 74.15%). During 
      the reperfusion phase, where the most severe hemodynamic instability occurred, DL 
      model showed superior correlation (0.861; 95% Confidence Interval, (CI), 
      0.855-0.866 vs. 0.570; 95% CI, 0.556-0.584, P < 0.001) and higher concordance 
      rate (90.6% vs. 75.8%) over EV1000. In conclusion, the DL-based model was 
      superior for estimating intraoperative SV and thus might guide physicians to 
      precise intraoperative hemodynamic management. Moreover, the DL model seems to be 
      particularly promising because it outperformed EV1000 in circumstance of rapid 
      hemodynamic changes where physicians need most help.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adequate postoperative pain management is crucial in pediatric 
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery because pain can lead to devastating short- 
      and long-term consequences. This review discusses the limitations of current 
      postoperative pain assessment and management in children after cardiac surgery, 
      the obstacles to providing optimal treatment, and concepts to consider that may 
      overcome these barriers. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE and PubMed. CONCLUSIONS: Effective 
      pain management in infants and young children undergoing cardiac surgery 
      continues to evolve with innovative methods of both assessment and therapy using 
      newer drugs or novel routes of administration. Artificial intelligence- and 
      machine learning-based pain assessment and patient-tailored management in both 
      pain measurement and prevention are already being integrated into the routine of 
      current practice.

TI  - Feasibility of sedation on demand in Taiwan using water exchange and air 
      insufflation: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 256-262
LID - 10.1111/jgh.14839 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Completion of colonoscopy without sedation eliminates 
      sedation cost and complications. Reported in the United States and Europe, 
      on-demand sedation is not routine practice in Taiwan. Water exchange (WE), 
      characterized by infusion and nearly complete removal of infused water during 
      insertion, reduces insertion pain compared to air insufflation (AI) during 
      colonoscopy. We evaluated the feasibility of on-demand sedation in Taiwan. In a 
      randomized controlled trial of WE vs AI colonoscopy, we also aimed to determine 
      if WE augmented the implementation by reducing insertion pain and decreasing 
      sedation requirement. METHODS: This prospective patient-blinded study randomized 
      patients to AI or WE (75 patients/group) to aid insertion. The primary outcome 
      was the proportion of patients completing without sedation. RESULTS: In the AI 
      and WE groups, 76.0% and 93.3% (P = 0.006) completed without need for sedation, 
      respectively. The WE group had lower insertion pain score (mean [SD]) (4.0 [2.9] 
      vs 2.1 [2.6], P < 0.001), lower doses of propofol (25.7 [52.7] mg vs 9.1 [35.6] 
      mg, P = 0.012), and less time in the recovery room (3.4 [7.4] vs 1.5 [5.5], 
      P = 0.027) than the AI group. Patient satisfaction scores and willingness to 
      repeat if needed in the future were similar. CONCLUSION: On-demand sedation was 
      feasible in Taiwan. The completion rate without sedation was high in patients 
      (76.0% with standard AI) open to the option (no prior intent to receive the 
      standard of full or minimal sedation). WE augmented the implementation by 
      reducing insertion pain and decreasing sedation requirement without adversely 
      affecting patient satisfaction or willingness to repeat.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pain researchers and clinicians increasingly encounter machine 
      learning algorithms in both research methods and clinical practice. This review 
      provides a summary of key machine learning principles, as well as applications to 
      both structured and unstructured datasets. RECENT FINDINGS: Aside from increasing 
      use in the analysis of electronic health record data, machine and deep learning 
      algorithms are now key tools in the analyses of neuroimaging and facial 
      expression recognition data used in pain research. SUMMARY: In the coming years, 
      machine learning is likely to become a key component of evidence-based medicine, 
      yet will require additional skills and perspectives for its successful and 
      ethical use in research and clinical settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to demonstrate that supervised machine learning (ML) models 
      can better predict postoperative complications after total shoulder arthroplasty 
      (TSA) than comorbidity indices. METHODS: The American College of 
      Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried from 
      2005-2017 for TSA cases. Training and validation sets were created by randomly 
      assigning 80% and 20% of the data set. Included variables were age, body mass 
      index (BMI), operative time, smoking status, comorbidities, diagnosis, and 
      preoperative hematocrit and albumin. Complications included any adverse event, 
      transfusion, extended length of stay (>3 days), surgical site infection, return 
      to the operating room, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 
      readmission. Each SML algorithm was compared with one another and to a baseline 
      model using American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification. Model 
      strength was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUC) and the positive predictive value (PPV) of 
      complications. RESULTS: We identified a total of 17,119 TSA cases. Mean age, BMI, 
      and length of stay were 69.5 ± 9.6 years, 31.1 ± 6.8, and 2.0 ± 2.2 days. 
      Percentage hematocrit, BMI, and operative time were of highest importance in 
      outcome prediction. SML algorithms outperformed ASA classification models for 
      predicting any adverse event (71.0% vs. 63.0%), transfusion (77.0% vs. 64.0%), 
      extended length of stay (68.0% vs. 60.0%), surgical site infection (65.0% vs. 
      58.0%), return to the operating room (59.0% vs. 54.0%), and readmission (64.0% 
      vs. 58.0%). SML algorithms demonstrated the greatest PPV for any adverse event 
      (62.5%), extended length of stay (61.4%), transfusion (52.2%), and readmission 
      (10.1%). ASA classification had a 0.0% PPV for complications. CONCLUSION: With 
      continued validation, intelligent models could calculate patient-specific risk 
      for complications to adjust perioperative care and site of surgery.

AB  - Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) becomes a standard procedure in 
      surgical operations and pain management, offers the advantages of nerve 
      localization, and provides region of interest anatomical structure visualization. 
      Nerve tracking presents a crucial step for practicing UGRA and it is useful and 
      important to develop a tool to facilitate this step. However, nerve tracking is a 
      very challenging task that anesthetists can encounter due to the noise, 
      artifacts, and nerve structure variability. Deep-learning has shown outstanding 
      performances in computer vision task including tracking. Many deep-learning 
      trackers have been proposed, where their performance depends on the application. 
      While no deep-learning study exists for tracking the nerves in ultrasound images, 
      this paper explores thirteen most recent deep-learning trackers for nerve 
      tracking and presents a comparative study for the best deep-learning trackers on 
      different types of nerves in ultrasound images. We evaluate the performance of 
      the trackers in terms of accuracy, consistency, time complexity, and handling 
      different nerve situations, such as disappearance and losing shape information. 
      Through the experimentation, certain conclusions were noted on deep learning 
      trackers performance. Overall, deep-learning trackers provide good performance 
      and show a comparative performance for tracking different kinds of nerves in 
      ultrasound images.

AB  - Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common birth anomalies, and the 
      care of children with CHD has improved over the past 4 decades. However, children 
      with CHD who undergo general anesthesia remain at increased risk for morbidity 
      and mortality. The proliferation of electronic health record systems and 
      sophisticated patient monitors affords the opportunity to capture and analyze 
      large amounts of CHD patient data, and the application of novel, effective 
      analytics methods to these data can enable clinicians to enhance their care of 
      pediatric CHD patients. This narrative review covers recent efforts to leverage 
      analytics in pediatric cardiac anesthesia and critical care to improve the care 
      of children with CHD.

TI  - Novel drug-independent sedation level estimation based on machine learning of 
      quantitative frontal electroencephalogram features in healthy volunteers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sedation indicators based on a single quantitative EEG (QEEG) feature 
      have been criticised for their limited performance. We hypothesised that 
      integration of multiple QEEG features into a single sedation-level estimator 
      using a machine learning algorithm could reliably predict levels of sedation, 
      independent of the sedative drug used. METHODS: In total, 102 subjects receiving 
      propofol (N=36; 16 male/20 female), sevoflurane (N=36; 16 male/20 female), or 
      dexmedetomidine (N=30; 15 male/15 female) were included in this study of healthy 
      volunteers. Sedation level was assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment 
      of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score. We used 44 QEEG features estimated from the 
      EEG data in a logistic regression algorithm, and an elastic-net regularisation 
      method was used for feature selection. The area under the receiver operator 
      characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the logistic 
      regression model. RESULTS: The performances obtained when the system was trained 
      and tested as drug-dependent mode to distinguish between awake and sedated states 
      (mean AUC [standard deviation]) were propofol=0.97 (0.03), sevoflurane=0.74 
      (0.25), and dexmedetomidine=0.77 (0.10). The drug-independent system resulted in 
      mean AUC=0.83 (0.17) to discriminate between the awake and sedated states. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of large numbers of QEEG features and machine 
      learning algorithms is feasible for next-generation monitors of sedation level. 
      Different QEEG features were selected for propofol, sevoflurane, and 
      dexmedetomidine groups, but the sedation-level estimator maintained a high 
      performance for predicting MOAA/S independent of the drug used. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - The advantages of water immersion colonoscopy in ambulatory service.
PG  - 636-640
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2019.18784 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The purpose of this prospective study was to compare patients' 
      discomfort during water immersion (WI) colonoscopy without sedation or available 
      on request, with that of patients during air insufflation (AI) colonoscopy with 
      sedation, in the ambulatory setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective 
      observational study was conducted in 100 patients who performed a colonoscopy 
      between August 2015 and February 2016 in an Ambulatory Gastroenterology Center in 
      Cluj-Napoca, Romania. They were divided into two branches A and B. Patients in 
      Group A underwent a classic colonoscopy with AI and standard sedation (2 mg of 
      midazolam and 50 mg of tramadol), while patients in Group B underwent an 
      unsedated or on demand sedation colonoscopy with WI technique. RESULTS: The 
      patients in group A presented a higher discomfort (statistically significant) 
      compared to those in group B, and had also the median total discomfort score 
      higher than those in group B. The patients in group A had also a higher 
      discomfort score after examination. The total time of examination was the same in 
      the two groups, but in group B the progression to cecum time was 3 minutes lower 
      than for those in group A. A greater discomfort of the patient was correlated 
      with the longer time required to reach the cecum. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, WI 
      colonoscopy is superior to AI technique in reducing insertion pain, 
      progression-to-cecum time, minimizing sedation requirements and also in the 
      willingness to repeat the technique.

TI  - Effects of sedatives and opioids on trigger and cycling asynchronies throughout 
      mechanical ventilation: an observational study in a large dataset from critically 
      ill patients.
PG  - 245
LID - 10.1186/s13054-019-2531-5 [doi]
LID - 245
AB  - BACKGROUND: In critically ill patients, poor patient-ventilator interaction may 
      worsen outcomes. Although sedatives are often administered to improve comfort and 
      facilitate ventilation, they can be deleterious. Whether opioids improve 
      asynchronies with fewer negative effects is unknown. We hypothesized that opioids 
      alone would improve asynchronies and result in more wakeful patients than 
      sedatives alone or sedatives-plus-opioids. METHODS: This prospective multicenter 
      observational trial enrolled critically ill adults mechanically ventilated (MV) 
      > 24 h. We compared asynchronies and sedation depth in patients receiving 
      sedatives, opioids, or both. We recorded sedation level and doses of sedatives 
      and opioids. BetterCare™ software continuously registered ineffective inspiratory 
      efforts during expiration (IEE), double cycling (DC), and asynchrony index (AI) 
      as well as MV modes. All variables were averaged per day. We used linear 
      mixed-effects models to analyze the relationships between asynchronies, sedation 
      level, and sedative and opioid doses. RESULTS: In 79 patients, 14,166,469 breaths 
      were recorded during 579 days of MV. Overall asynchronies were not significantly 
      different in days classified as sedatives-only, opioids-only, and 
      sedatives-plus-opioids and were more prevalent in days classified as no-drugs 
      than in those classified as sedatives-plus-opioids, irrespective of the 
      ventilatory mode. Sedative doses were associated with sedation level and with 
      reduced DC (p < 0.0001) in sedatives-only days. However, on days classified as 
      sedatives-plus-opioids, higher sedative doses and deeper sedation had more IEE 
      (p < 0.0001) and higher AI (p = 0.0004). Opioid dosing was inversely associated 
      with overall asynchronies (p < 0.001) without worsening sedation levels into 
      morbid ranges. CONCLUSIONS: Sedatives, whether alone or combined with opioids, do 
      not result in better patient-ventilator interaction than opioids alone, in any 
      ventilatory mode. Higher opioid dose (alone or with sedatives) was associated 
      with lower AI without depressing consciousness. Higher sedative doses 
      administered alone were associated only with less DC. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - This editorial previews and summarizes the content of the current themed issue of 
      J Pharm Tox Methods derived from the recent 2018 Annual Safety Pharmacology 
      Society (SPS) meeting held in Washington, DC. The papers highlight improvements 
      in methods and study endpoints used in non-clinical safety pharmacology (SP) to 
      enhance clinical translatability. Articles cover areas including the SP 
      assessment of oligonucleotides and gene therapy, core battery clinical 
      translation case studies, next generation non-opiate pain management strategy, 
      aspects of cardio-oncology that extend the traditional objectives of an SP 
      assessment, real-world advanced imaging techniques used in preclinical safety, in 
      silico approaches including mathematical modeling, machine learning, and 
      bioinformatics and how secondary SP studies impact clinical trial interpretation 
      and design. The meeting included scientific content from >190 abstracts 
      (reproduced in the current volume of J Pharm Tox Methods).

AB  - Monitoring the hypnotic component of anesthesia during surgeries is critical to 
      prevent intraoperative awareness and reduce adverse side effects. For this 
      purpose, electroencephalographic (EEG) methods complementing measures of 
      autonomic functions and behavioral responses are in use in clinical practice. 
      However, in human neonates and infants existing methods may be unreliable and the 
      correlation between brain activity and anesthetic depth is still poorly 
      understood. Here, we characterized the effects of different anesthetics on brain 
      activity in neonatal mice and developed machine learning approaches to identify 
      electrophysiological features predicting inspired or end-tidal anesthetic 
      concentration as a proxy for anesthetic depth. We show that similar features from 
      EEG recordings can be applied to predict anesthetic concentration in neonatal 
      mice and humans. These results might support a novel strategy to monitor 
      anesthetic depth in human newborns.

TI  - Design and Implementation of a Machine Learning Based EEG Processor for Accurate 
      Estimation of Depth of Anesthesia.
PG  - 658-669
LID - 10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2921875 [doi]
AB  - Accurate monitoring of the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is essential for 
      intraoperative and postoperative patient's health. Commercially available 
      electroencephalograph (EEG)-based DoA monitors are recommended only for certain 
      anesthetic drugs and specific age-group patients. This paper presents a machine 
      learning classification processor for accurate DoA estimation irrespective of the 
      patient's age and anesthetic drug. The classification is solely based on six 
      features extracted from EEG signal, i.e., spectral edge frequency (SEF), beta 
      ratio, and four bands of spectral energy (FBSE). A machine learning fine decision 
      tree classifier is adopted to achieve a four-class DoA classification (deep, 
      moderate, and light DoA versus awake state). The feature selection and the 
      classification processor are optimized to achieve the highest classification 
      accuracy for the state of moderate anesthesia required for the surgical 
      operations. The proposed 256-point fast Fourier transform accelerator is 
      implemented to realize SEF, beta ratio, and FBSE that enables minimal latency and 
      high accuracy feature extraction. The proposed DoA processor is implemented using 
      a 65 nm CMOS technology and experimentally verified using field programming gate 
      array (FPGA) based on the EEG recordings of 75 patients undergoing elective 
      surgery with different types of anesthetic agents. The processor achieves an 
      average accuracy of 92.2% for all DoA states, with a latency of 1s The 0.09 mm(2) 
      DoA processor consumes 140nJ/classification.

TI  - Identifying Patients Experiencing Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression During 
      Recovery From Anesthesia: The Application of Electronic Monitoring Devices.
PG  - 186-194
LID - 10.1111/wvn.12362 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postsurgical patients experiencing opioid-related adverse drug events 
      have 55% longer hospital stays, 47% higher costs associated with their care, 36% 
      increased risk of 30-day readmission, and 3.4 times higher risk of inpatient 
      mortality compared to those with no opioid-related adverse drug events. Most of 
      the adverse events are preventable. GENERAL AIM: This study explored three types 
      of electronic monitoring devices (pulse oximetry, capnography, and minute 
      ventilation [MV]) to determine which were more effective at identifying the 
      patient experiencing respiratory compromise and, further, to determine whether 
      algorithms could be developed from the electronic monitoring data to aid in 
      earlier detection of respiratory depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A study was 
      performed in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) in an inner city. Sixty patients 
      were recruited in the preoperative admissions department on the day of their 
      surgery. Forty-eight of the 60 patients wore three types of electronic monitoring 
      devices while they were recovering from back, neck, hip, or knee surgery. Machine 
      learning models were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-four of the 48 
      patients exhibited sustained signs of opioid-induced respiratory depression 
      (OIRD). Although the SpO(2) values did not change, end-tidal CO(2) levels 
      increased, and MV decreased, representing hypoventilation. A machine learning 
      model was able to predict an OIRD event 10 min before the actual event occurred 
      with 80% accuracy. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Electronic monitoring devices are 
      currently used as a tool to assess respiratory status using thresholds to 
      distinguish when respiratory depression has occurred. This study introduces a 
      potential paradigm shift from a reactive approach to a proactive approach that 
      would identify a patient at high risk for OIRD. Capnography and MV were found to 
      be effective tools in detecting respiratory compromise in the PACU.

TI  - Nonoperating room anesthesia education: preparing our residents for the future.
PG  - 490-497
LID - 10.1097/ACO.0000000000000743 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nonoperating room anesthesia (NORA) is the fastest growing 
      segment of anesthetic practice. This review provides an overview of knowledge and 
      trends that will need to be introduced to residents as part of their education. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Topics for the future include, but are not limited to, new 
      medications, artificial intelligence and big data, monitoring depth of hypnosis, 
      translational innovation and collaboration, demographic changes, financial 
      driving forces, destination hubs, medical tourism, and new approaches to 
      education training and self-management. SUMMARY: Implementing new medical 
      technologies for anesthesia outside the operating room will help to successfully 
      master this ever evolving subspecialty. Anesthesiologists require specific 
      preparation for the diverse settings that they will encounter during their 
      training. In this rapidly changing field, cognitive fitness must be factored into 
      teaching and evaluation of residents. We describe the most important topics to 
      consider when educating anesthesiology residents, and highlight research that 
      addresses upcoming challenges.

TI  - Therapeutic Effect of Dipsacus asperoides C. Y. Cheng et T. M. Ai in

LID - 10.3390/ijms20081855 [doi]
LID - 1855
AB  - Dipsacus asperoides C. Y. Cheng et T. M. Ai (DA) has been used in China as a 
      traditional medicine to treat lumbar and knee pain, liver dysfunction, and 
      fractures. We explored the suppressive effect of DA on allergic asthma using an 
      ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma model. In the asthma model, female Balb/c mice 
      were sensitized to OVA on day 0 and 14 to boost immune responses and then exposed 
      to OVA solution by using an ultrasonic nebulizer on days 21 to 23. DA (20 and 40 
      mg/kg) was administered to mice by oral gavage on days 18 to 23. Methacholine 
      responsiveness was determined on day 24 using a plethysmography. On day 25, we 
      collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, serum, and lung tissue from animals under 
      anesthesia. DA treatment effectively inhibited methacholine responsiveness, 
      inflammatory cell infiltration, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 
      (IL)-5 and IL-13, and immunoglobulin (Ig) E in OVA-induced asthma model. 
      Reductions in airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion, accompanied by 
      decreases in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the 
      phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), were also observed. Our 
      results indicated that DA attenuated the asthmatic response, and that this 
      attenuation was closely linked to NF-κB suppression. Thus, this study suggests 
      that DA is a potential therapeutic for allergic asthma.

AB  - Commercial applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have made 
      remarkable progress recently, particularly in areas such as image recognition, 
      natural speech processing, language translation, textual analysis, and 
      self-learning. Progress had historically languished in these areas, such that 
      these skills had come to seem ineffably bound to intelligence. However, these 
      commercial advances have performed best at single-task applications in which 
      imperfect outputs and occasional frank errors can be tolerated.The practice of 
      anesthesiology is different. It embodies a requirement for high reliability, and 
      a pressured cycle of interpretation, physical action, and response rather than 
      any single cognitive act. This review covers the basics of what is meant by 
      artificial intelligence and machine learning for the practicing anesthesiologist, 
      describing how decision-making behaviors can emerge from simple equations. 
      Relevant clinical questions are introduced to illustrate how machine learning 
      might help solve them-perhaps bringing anesthesiology into an era of 
      machine-assisted discovery.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of a New Depth of Anesthesia Index in ConView® System and 
      the Bispectral Index during Total Intravenous Anesthesia: A Multicenter Clinical 
      Trial.

AB  - The performance of a new monitor for the depth of anesthesia (DOA), the Depth of 
      Anesthesia Index (Ai) based on sample entropy (SampEn), 95% spectral edge 
      frequency (95%SEF), and burst suppression ratio (BSR) was evaluated compared to 
      Bispectral Index (BIS) during total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). 144 patients 
      in six medical centers were enrolled. General anesthesia was induced with 
      stepwise-increased target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol until loss of 
      consciousness (LOC). During surgery propofol was titrated according to BIS. Both 
      Ai and BIS were recorded. Primary outcomes: the limits of agreement between Ai 
      and BIS were -17.68 and 16.49, which were, respectively, -30.0% and 28.0% of the 
      mean value of BIS. Secondary outcomes: prediction probability (Pk) of BIS and Ai 
      was 0.943 and 0.935 (p=0.102) during LOC and 0.928 and 0.918 (p=0.037) during 
      recovery of consciousness (ROC). And the values of BIS and Ai were 68.19 and 
      66.44 at 50%LOC, and 76.65 and 78.60 at 50%ROC. A decrease or an increase of Ai 
      was significantly greater than that of BIS when consciousness changes (during 
      LOC: -9.13±10.20 versus -5.83±9.63, p<0.001; during ROC: 10.88±11.51 versus 
      5.32±7.53, p<0.001). The conclusion is that Ai has similar characteristic of BIS 
      as a DOA monitor and revealed the advantage of SampEn for indicating conscious 
      level. This trial is registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry with 
      ChiCTR-IOR-16009471.

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach for the Identification of a Biomarker of Human Pain 
      using fNIRS.
PG  - 5645
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-42098-w [doi]
LID - 5645
AB  - Pain is a highly unpleasant sensory and emotional experience, and no objective 
      diagnosis test exists to assess it. In clinical practice there are two main 
      methods for the estimation of pain, a patient's self-report and clinical 
      judgement. However, these methods are highly subjective and the need of 
      biomarkers to measure pain is important to improve pain management, reduce risk 
      factors, and contribute to a more objective, valid, and reliable diagnosis. 
      Therefore, in this study we propose the use of functional near-infrared 
      spectroscopy (fNIRS) and machine learning for the identification of a possible 
      biomarker of pain. We collected pain information from 18 volunteers using the 
      thermal test of the quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol, according to 
      temperature level (cold and hot) and pain intensity (low and high). Feature 
      extraction was completed in three different domains (time, frequency, and 
      wavelet), and a total of 69 features were obtained. Feature selection was carried 
      out according to three criteria, information gain (IG), joint mutual information 
      (JMI), and Chi-squared (χ(2)). The significance of each feature ranking was 
      evaluated using three learning models separately, linear discriminant analysis 
      (LDA), the K-nearest neighbour (K-NN) and support vector machines (SVM) using the 
      linear and Gaussian and polynomial kernels. The results showed that the Gaussian 
      SVM presented the highest accuracy (94.17%) using only 25 features to identify 
      the four types of pain in our database. In addition, we propose the use of the 
      top 13 features according to the JMI criteria, which exhibited an accuracy of 
      89.44%, as promising biomarker of pain. This study contributes to the idea of 
      developing an objective assessment of pain and proposes a potential biomarker of 
      human pain using fNIRS.

      Measures Using Machine Learning Techniques.
PG  - 48-59
LID - 10.1016/j.smhl.2018.01.002 [doi]
AB  - Pain management is a crucial part in Sickle Cell Disease treatment. Accurate pain 
      assessment is the first stage in pain management. However, pain is a subjective 
      response and hard to assess via objective approaches. In this paper, we proposed 
      a system to map objective physiological measures to subjective self-reported pain 
      scores using machine learning techniques. Using Multinomial Logistic Regression 
      and data from 40 patients, we were able to predict patients' pain scores on an 
      11-point rating scale with an average accuracy of 0.578 at the intra-individual 
      level, and an accuracy of 0.429 at the inter-individual level. With a condensed 
      4-point rating scale, the accuracy at the inter-individual level was further 
      improved to 0.681. Overall, we presented a preliminary machine learning model 
      that can predict pain scores in SCD patients with promising results. To our 
      knowledge, such a system has not been proposed earlier within the SCD or pain 
      domains by exploiting machine learning concepts within the clinical framework.

TI  - Techniques for minimizing sedation in pediatric MRI.
PG  - 1047-1054
LID - 10.1002/jmri.26703 [doi]
AB  - MRI is used widely in infants and young children. However, in these young cases 
      deep sedation or general anesthesia is often required to minimize motion 
      artifacts during MRI examinations. Although the benefits of MR typically outweigh 
      the potential risks of sedation when delivered by an experienced team, there are 
      increasing concerns regarding the affect of sedation on young children. There 
      continues to be a push to develop various strategies that can minimize the need 
      for sedation. The present review summarizes several technical and clinical 
      approaches that can help decrease the need for sedation in the pediatric patient. 
      Optimization of the MRI environment, the role of child life specialists,

TI  - Pushing the limits of liver surgery for colorectal liver metastases: Current 
      state and future directions.
PG  - 34-40
LID - 10.4240/wjgs.v11.i2.34 [doi]
AB  - Liver surgery for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases is the standard 
      treatment in a dynamic surgical field with many variables that should be 
      considered in a curative intent scenario. Hepatectomy for colorectal liver 
      metastases has undergone constant changes over the last 30 years, including 
      indications until the need for rescue procedures of recurrent and advanced 
      diseases as well as minimally invasive surgery. These advancements in liver 
      surgery have not only resulted from overall improvements in the surgical field 
      but have also resulted from a better understanding of the biological behavior of 
      the disease, liver regeneration, and homeostasis during and after surgery. 
      Improvements in anesthesiology, intensive care medicine, radiology, and surgical 
      devices have correlated with further advancements of hepatectomies. Moreover, 
      changes are still forthcoming, and both fields of augmented reality and 
      artificial intelligence will likely have future contributions in this field in 
      regard to both diagnoses and the planning of procedures. The aim of this 
      editorial is to emphasize several aspects that have contributed to the paradigm 
      shifts in colorectal liver metastases surgery over the last three decades as well 
      as to discuss the factors concerning patient selection and the technical aspects 
      of liver surgery. Finally, this editorial will highlight the promising new 
      features of this surgery for diagnoses and treatments in this field.

TI  - Investigating a Needle-Based Epidural Procedure in Obstetric Anesthesia.
PG  - 720-729
AB  - This study investigates the safety and efficacy of a large-dose, needle-based 
      epidural technique in obstetric anesthesia. The technique differs from a 
      standard, catheter-based approach in that the anesthetic dose is administered 
      through an epidural needle prior to insertion of the epidural catheter. Using a 
      data-driven informatics and machine learning approach, our findings show that the 
      needle-based technique is faster and more dose-effective in achieving sensory 
      level. We also find that injecting large doses in the epidural space through the 
      epidural needle is safe, with complication rates similar to those reported in 
      published literature for catheter-based technique. Further, machine learning 
      reveals that if the needle dose is kept under 18 ml, the resulting hypotension 
      rate will be significantly lower than published results. The machine learning 
      framework can predict the incidence of hypotension with 85% accuracy. The 
      findings from this investigation facilitate delivery improvement and establish an 
      improved clinical practice guideline for training and for dissemination of safe 
      practice.

TI  - Negative Patient-Experience Comments After Total Shoulder Arthroplasty.
PG  - 330-337
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.18.00695 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in enhancing the patient experience after 
      discretionary orthopaedic surgery. Patient narratives are a potentially valuable 
      but largely unscrutinized source of information. Using machine learning to 
      understand sentiment within patient-experience comments, we explored the content 
      of negative comments after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), their associated 
      factors, and their relationship with traditional measures of patient satisfaction 
      and with perioperative outcomes. METHODS: An institutional registry was used to 
      link the records of 186 patients who had undergone elective primary TSA between 
      2016 and 2017 with vendor-supplied patient satisfaction data, which included 
      patient comments and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and 
      Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Using a machine-learning-based natural language 
      processing approach, all patient comments were mined for sentiment and classified 
      as positive, negative, mixed, or neutral. Negative comments were further 
      classified into themes. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to 
      determine characteristics associated with providing a negative comment. RESULTS: 
      Most patients (71%) provided at least 1 comment; 32% of the comments were 
      negative, 62% were positive, 5% were mixed, and 1% were neutral. The themes of 
      the negative comments were room condition (27%), time management (17%), 
      inefficient communication (13%), lack of compassion (12%), difficult intravenous 
      (IV) insertion (10%), food (10%), medication side effects (6%), discharge 
      instructions (4%), and pain management (2%). Women and sicker patients were more 
      likely to provide negative comments. Patients who made negative comments were 
      more likely to be dissatisfied with overall hospital care and with pain 
      management (2 HCAHPS core items), but there were no differences in any of the 
      studied outcomes (peak pain intensity, opioid intake, operative time, hospital 
      length of stay, discharge disposition, or 1-year American Shoulder and Elbow 
      Surgeons [ASES] score) between those who provided negative comments and those who 
      did not. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-narrative analysis can shed light on the aspects of 
      the process of care that are most critiqued by patients. While patient 
      satisfaction may not be a surrogate for effectiveness of care or functional 
      outcomes, efforts to improve the hospital environment, enhance nontechnical 
      skills, and reduce unnecessary delays are important in providing high-quality, 
      patient-centered care after TSA.

AB  - Widely-prescribed prodrug opioids (e.g., hydrocodone) require conversion by liver 
      enzyme CYP-2D6 to exert their analgesic effects. The most commonly prescribed 
      antidepressant, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), inhibits CYP-2D6 
      activity and therefore may reduce the effectiveness of prodrug opioids. We used a 
      machine learning approach to identify patients prescribed a combination of SSRIs 
      and prodrug opioids postoperatively and to examine the effect of this combination 
      on postoperative pain control. Using EHR data from an academic medical center, we 
      identified patients receiving surgery over a 9-year period. We developed and 
      validated natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to extract 
      depression-related information (diagnosis, SSRI use, symptoms) from structured 
      and unstructured data elements. The primary outcome was the difference between 
      preoperative pain score and postoperative pain at discharge, 3-week and 8-week 
      time points. We developed computational models to predict the increase or 
      decrease in the postoperative pain across the 3 time points by using the 
      patient's EHR data (e.g. medications, vitals, demographics) captured before 
      surgery. We evaluate the generalizability of the model using 10-fold 
      cross-validation method where the holdout test method is repeated 10 times and 
      mean area-under-the-curve (AUC) is considered as evaluation metrics for the 
      prediction performance. We identified 4,306 surgical patients with symptoms of 
      depression. A total of 14.1% were prescribed both an SSRI and a prodrug opioid, 
      29.4% were prescribed an SSRI and a non-prodrug opioid, 18.6% were prescribed a 
      prodrug opioid but were not on SSRIs, and 37.5% were prescribed a non-prodrug 
      opioid but were not on SSRIs. Our NLP algorithm identified depression with a F1 
      score of 0.95 against manual annotation of 300 randomly sampled clinical notes. 
      On average, patients receiving prodrug opioids had lower average pain scores 
      (p<0.05), with the exception of the SSRI+ group at 3-weeks postoperative 
      follow-up. However, SSRI+/Prodrug+ had significantly worse pain control at 
      discharge, 3 and 8-week follow-up (p < .01) compared to SSRI+/Prodrug- patients, 
      whereas there was no difference in pain control among the SSRI- patients by 
      prodrug opioid (p>0.05). The machine learning algorithm accurately predicted the 
      increase or decrease of the discharge, 3-week and 8-week follow-up pain scores 
      when compared to the pre-operative pain score using 10-fold cross validation 
      (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.87, 0.81, and 
      0.69, respectively). Preoperative pain, surgery type, and opioid tolerance were 
      the strongest predictors of postoperative pain control. We provide the first 
      direct clinical evidence that the known ability of SSRIs to inhibit prodrug 
      opioid effectiveness is associated with worse pain control among depressed 
      patients. Current prescribing patterns indicate that prescribers may not account 
      for this interaction when choosing an opioid. The study results imply that 
      prescribers might instead choose direct acting opioids (e.g. oxycodone or 
      morphine) in depressed patients on SSRIs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sedation of neurocritically ill patients is one of the most 
      challenging situation in ICUs. Quantitative knowledge on the sedation effect on 
      brain activity in that complex scenario could help to uncover new markers for 
      sedation assessment. Hence, we aim to evaluate the existence of changes of 
      diverse EEG-derived measures in deeply-sedated (RASS-Richmond agitation-sedation 
      scale  -4 and  -5) neurocritically ill patients, and also whether sedation doses 
      are related with those eventual changes. APPROACH: We performed an observational 
      prospective cohort study in the intensive care unit of the Hospital de la 
      Princesa. Twenty-six adult patients suffered from traumatic brain injury and 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage were included in the present study. Long-term continuous 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings (2141 h) and hourly annotated 
      information were used to determine the relationship between intravenous sedation 
      infusion doses and network and spectral EEG measures. To do that, two different 
      strategies were followed: assessment of the statistical dependence between both 
      variables using the Spearman correlation rank and by performing an automatic 
      classification method based on a machine learning algorithm. MAIN RESULTS: More 
      than 60% of patients presented a correlation greater than 0.5 in at least one of 
      the calculated EEG measures with the sedation dose. The automatic classification 
      method presented an accuracy of 84.3% in discriminating between different 
      sedation doses. In both cases the nodes' degree was the most relevant 
      measurement. SIGNIFICANCE: The results presented here provide evidences of brain 
      activity changes during deep sedation linked to sedation doses. Particularly, the 
      capability of network EEG-derived measures in discriminating between different 
      sedation doses could be the framework for the development of accurate methods for 
      sedation levels assessment.

AB  - Aim: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a useful tool for assisting in 
      correct differentiation of tumor progression from reactive changes. 
      O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET)-PET in combination with MRI can add 
      valuable information for clinical decision making. Acquiring FET-PET/MRI 
      simultaneously allows for a one-stop-shop that limits the need for a second 
      sedation or anesthesia as with PET and MRI in sequence. PET/MRI is challenged by 
      lack of a direct measure of photon attenuation. Accepted solutions for 
      attenuation correction (AC) might not be applicable to pediatrics. The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate the use of the subject-specific MR-derived AC method 
      RESOLUTE, modified to a pediatric cohort, against the performance of an MR-AC 
      technique based on deep learning in a pediatric brain tumor cohort. Methods: The 
      modifications to RESOLUTE and the implementation of a deep learning method were 
      performed using 79 pediatric patient examinations. We analyzed the 36 of these 
      with active brain tumor area above 1 mL. We measured background (B), tumor mean 
      and maximal activity (T(MEAN), T(MAX)), biological tumor volume (BTV), and 
      calculated the clinical metrics T(MEAN)/B and T(MAX)/B. Results: Overall, we 
      found both RESOLUTE and our DeepUTE methodologies to accurately reproduce the 
      CT-AC clinical metrics. Regardless of age, both methods were able to obtain AC 
      maps similar to the CT-AC, albeit with DeepUTE producing the most similar based 
      on both quantitative metrics and visual inspection. In the patient-by-patient 
      analysis DeepUTE was the only technique with all patients inside the predefined 
      acceptable clinical limits. It also had a higher precision with relative 
      %-difference to the reference CT-AC (T(MAX)/B mean: -0.1%, CI: [-0.8%, 0.5%], p = 
      0.54) compared to RESOLUTE (T(MAX)/B mean: 0.3%, CI: [-0.6%, 1.2%], p = 0.67) and 
      DIXON-AC (T(MAX)/B mean: 5.9%, CI: [4.5%, 7.4%], p < 0.0001). Conclusion: 
      Overall, we found DeepUTE to be the AC method that most robustly reproduced the 
      CT-AC clinical metrics per se, closely followed by RESOLUTE modified to pediatric 
      cohorts. The added accuracy due to better noise handling of DeepUTE, ease of use, 
      as well as the improved runtime makes DeepUTE the method of choice for PET/MRI 
      attenuation correction.

AB  - The Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx) is a 
      National Institutes for Neurological Diseases and Stoke funded 
      Centers-Without-Walls international multidisciplinary study aimed at preventing 
      epileptogenesis. The preclinical biomarker discovery in EpiBios4Rx applies a 
      multicenter study design to allow the number of animals that are required for 
      adequate statistical power for the analysis to be studied in an efficient manner. 
      Further, the use of multiple centers mimics the clinical trial situation, and 
      therefore potentially the chance of successful clinical translation of the 
      outcomes of the study. Its successful implementation requires harmonization of 
      procedures and data analyses between the three contributing centers in Finland, 
      Australia, and USA. The objective of the present analysis was to develop metrics 
      for analysis of the success of harmonization of procedures to guide further data 
      analyses and plan the future multicenter preclinical studies. The interim 
      analysis of data is based on the analysis of data from 212 rats with lateral 
      fluid-percussion injury or sham-operation included in the biomarker discovery by 
      April 30, 2018. The details of protocols, including production of injury, 
      post-injury follow-up, blood sampling, electroencephalogram recording, and 
      magnetic resonance imaging have been presented in the accompanying manuscripts in 
      this Supplement. Implementation of protocols in EpiBios4Rx project participant 
      centers was visualized in 2D using t-distributed stochastic neighborhood 
      embedding (t-SNE). The protocols applied to each rat were presented as feature 
      vectors of procedure related variables (e.g., impact pressure, anesthesia time). 
      The total number of protocol features linked to each rat was 112. The missing 
      data was accounted in visualization by utilizing imputation and adding the number 
      of missing values as a third dimension to 2D t-SNE plot, resulting in a 3D 
      overview of protocol data. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) using 
      Euclidean distances and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 
      of k-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN) were utilized to quantify the degree of 
      clustering by center. Both subsets of data with incomplete protocol vectors 
      omitted and missing protocol data imputed were assessed. Our data show that a 
      visible clustering by center was observed in all t-SNE plots, except for day 7 
      neuroscores. Both ICC and AUC indicated clustering by center in all protocol 
      variable subsets, excluding unimputed day 7 neuroscores (ICC 0.04 and AUC 0.6). 
      ICC for imputed set of all protocol related variables was 0.1 and KNN AUC 0.92. 
      In conclusion, both ICC and AUC indicated differences in protocol between 
      EpiBios4Rx participating centers, which needs to be taken into account in data 
      analysis. Importantly, the majority of observed differences are recoverable as 
      they relate to insufficient updates in record keeping. While AUC score of KNN is 
      a more sensitive measure for protocol harmonization than ICC for data that 
      displays complex splintered clustering, ICC and AUC provide complementary 
      measures to assess the degree of procedural harmonization. This experience should 
      be helpful for other groups planning such multicenter post-traumatic 
      epileptogenesis studies in the future.

PG  - 90-99

AB  - Elective surgical pathways offer a particular opportunity to plan radical change 
      in the way care is delivered, based on patient need rather than provider 
      convenience. Peri-operative pathway redesign enables improved patient experience 
      of care (including quality and satisfaction), population/public health, and 
      healthcare value (outcome per unit of currency). Among physicians with the skills 
      to work within peri-operative medicine, anaesthetists are well positioned to lead 
      the re-engineering of such pathways. Re-engineered pre-operative pathways open up 
      opportunities for intervention before surgery including shared decision-making, 
      comorbidity management and collaborative behavioural change. Individualised, 
      risk-adapted, intra-operative interventions will drive more reliable and 
      consistent care. Risk-adapted postoperative care, particularly around transitions 
      of care, has a significant role in improving value through peri-operative 
      medicine. Improved integration with primary care providers offers the potential 
      for minimising errors around transitions of care before and after surgery, as 
      well as maximising opportunities for population health interventions, including 
      lifestyle modification (e.g. activity/exercise, smoking and/or alcohol 
      cessation), pain management and sleep medicine. Systematic data collection 
      focused on quality improvement is essential to drive continuous clinical 
      improvement and will be enabled by technological development in predictive 
      analytics, systems modelling and artificial intelligence.

AB  - In sheep industry, genetic progress rate achieved by artificial insemination (AI) 
      is limited by the convoluted anatomy of the cervix, which does not allow the 
      passage of an insemination catheter for uterine semen deposition. The aim of this 
      study was to test, in 98 pregnant at term Sarda ewes, the effects of: Experiment 
      1) total or partial ablation of cervical folds and Experiment 2) 4 or 2 incisions 
      of cervical folds, on the passage of an insemination catheter, deposition of 
      frozen-thawed semen and pregnancy rates. Surgical procedures were performed 
      within 24 h from parturition providing deep sedation and epidural anaesthesia. 
      Duration of surgeries and post-operatory recovery were carefully monitored. For 
      both experiments, 5 months since surgery, independently of the stage of oestrus 
      cycle, cervical patency was tested through the transcervical passage of a 
      palpation probe. Six months since surgery, in Experiment 1, ewes were naturally 
      mated with fertile rams. In Experiment 2, ewes submitted to incisions of the 
      cervical folds and a control group underwent synchronisation of oestrus and 
      transcervical AI with frozen-thawed semen. Thirty days later, for both 
      experiments, pregnancy rates were assessed by ultrasonography and lambing rates 
      were recorded. Five months after surgery, in Experiment 1, transcervical passage 
      of a palpation probe to reach the uterine lumen was possible in all ewes 
      submitted to total and partial ablation of folds. In Experiment 2, this was 
      achievable in 90.5% ewes with 4 incisions of the folds and in 89.6% ewes with 2 
      incisions with no significant differences among groups (P = 0.44). In Experiment 
      1, pregnancy rates in ewes mated to rams after total or partial ablation of the 
      cervical folds was 100%. In Experiment 2, following transcervical AI, pregnancy 
      rates were higher in groups submitted to 4 (63.7%) or 2 (41.4%) incisions of the 
      cervical folds compared to the control group (8%; P<0.05). These data were 
      confirmed at lambing with rates of 56.8% and 41.4% in ewes submitted to 4 or 2 
      incisions respectively, significantly higher than the control group (4%; P<0.05). 
      Surgical ablation or incision of the cervical folds in post-partum ewes represent 
      valid procedures for transcervical intrauterine deposition of semen for AI, 
      obtaining satisfactory pregnancy rates. These procedures might be useful in 
      programs of genetic selection and MOET.

TI  - Trends in anesthesiology research: a machine learning approach to theme discovery 
      and summarization.
PG  - 283-293
LID - 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooy009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Traditionally, summarization of research themes and trends within a 
      given discipline was accomplished by manual review of scientific works in the 
      field. However, with the ushering in of the age of "big data," new methods for 
      discovery of such information become necessary as traditional techniques become 
      increasingly difficult to apply due to the exponential growth of document 
      repositories. Our objectives are to develop a pipeline for unsupervised theme 
      extraction and summarization of thematic trends in document repositories, and to 
      test it by applying it to a specific domain. METHODS: To that end, we detail a 
      pipeline, which utilizes machine learning and natural language processing for 
      unsupervised theme extraction, and a novel method for summarization of thematic 
      trends, and network mapping for visualization of thematic relations. We then 
      apply this pipeline to a collection of anesthesiology abstracts. RESULTS: We 
      demonstrate how this pipeline enables discovery of major themes and temporal 
      trends in anesthesiology research and facilitates document classification and 
      corpus exploration. DISCUSSION: The relation of prevalent topics and extracted 
      trends to recent events in both anesthesiology, and healthcare in general, 
      demonstrates the pipeline's utility. Furthermore, the agreement between the 
      unsupervised thematic grouping and human-assigned classification validates the 
      pipeline's accuracy and demonstrates another potential use. CONCLUSION: The 
      described pipeline enables summarization and exploration of large document 
      repositories, facilitates classification, aids in trend identification. A more 
      robust and user-friendly interface will facilitate the expansion of this 
      methodology to other domains. This will be the focus of future work for our 
      group.

TI  - Defining and Predicting Pain Volatility in Users of the Manage My Pain App: 
      Analysis Using Data Mining and Machine Learning Methods.
PG  - e12001
LID - 10.2196/12001 [doi]
LID - e12001
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring and predicting pain volatility (fluctuation or variability 
      in pain scores over time) can help improve pain management. Perceptions of pain 
      and its consequent disabling effects are often heightened under the conditions of 
      greater uncertainty and unpredictability associated with pain volatility. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use data mining and machine learning methods to 
      (1) define a new measure of pain volatility and (2) predict future pain 
      volatility levels from users of the pain management app, Manage My Pain, based on 
      demographic, clinical, and app use features. METHODS: Pain volatility was defined 
      as the mean of absolute changes between 2 consecutive self-reported pain severity 
      scores within the observation periods. The k-means clustering algorithm was 
      applied to users' pain volatility scores at the first and sixth month of app use 
      to establish a threshold discriminating low from high volatility classes. 
      Subsequently, we extracted 130 demographic, clinical, and app usage features from 
      the first month of app use to predict these 2 volatility classes at the sixth 
      month of app use. Prediction models were developed using 4 methods: (1) logistic 
      regression with ridge estimators; (2) logistic regression with Least Absolute 
      Shrinkage and Selection Operator; (3) Random Forests; and (4) Support Vector 
      Machines. Overall prediction accuracy and accuracy for both classes were 
      calculated to compare the performance of the prediction models. Training and 
      testing were conducted using 5-fold cross validation. A class imbalance issue was 
      addressed using a random subsampling of the training dataset. Users with at least 
      five pain records in both the predictor and outcome periods (N=782 users) are 
      included in the analysis. RESULTS: k-means clustering algorithm was applied to 
      pain volatility scores to establish a threshold of 1.6 to differentiate between 
      low and high volatility classes. After validating the threshold using random 
      subsamples, 2 classes were created: low volatility (n=611) and high volatility 
      (n=171). In this class-imbalanced dataset, all 4 prediction models achieved 78.1% 
      (611/782) to 79.0% (618/782) in overall accuracy. However, all models have a 
      prediction accuracy of less than 18.7% (32/171) for the high volatility class. 
      After addressing the class imbalance issue using random subsampling, results 
      improved across all models for the high volatility class to greater than 59.6% 
      (102/171). The prediction model based on Random Forests performs the best as it 
      consistently achieves approximately 70% accuracy for both classes across 3 random 
      subsamples. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a novel method for measuring pain volatility. 
      Cluster analysis was applied to divide users into subsets of low and high 
      volatility classes. These classes were then predicted at the sixth month of app 
      use with an acceptable degree of accuracy using machine learning methods based on 
      the features extracted from demographic, clinical, and app use information from 
      the first month.

TI  - Automated Pain Assessment using Electrodermal Activity Data and Machine Learning.
PG  - 372-375
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512389 [doi]
AB  - Objective pain assessment is required for appropriate pain management in the 
      clinical setting. However, clinical gold standard pain assessment is based on 
      subjective methods. Automated pain detection from physiological data may provide 
      important objective information to better standardize pain assessment. 
      Specifically, electrodermal activity (EDA) can identify features of stress and 
      anxiety induced by varying pain levels. However, notable variability in EDA 
      measurement exists and research to date has demonstrated sensitivity but lack of 
      specificity in pain assessment. In this paper, we use timescale decomposition 
      (TSD) to extract salient features from EDA signals to identify an accurate and 
      automated EDA pain detection algorithm to sensitively and specifically 
      distinguish pain from no-pain conditions.

TI  - Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury after Liver Transplantation: Machine Learning 
      Approaches vs. Logistic Regression Model.
LID - 10.3390/jcm7110428 [doi]
LID - 428
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) after liver transplantation has been reported to be 
      associated with increased mortality. Recently, machine learning approaches were 
      reported to have better predictive ability than the classic statistical analysis. 
      We compared the performance of machine learning approaches with that of logistic 
      regression analysis to predict AKI after liver transplantation. We reviewed 1211 
      patients and preoperative and intraoperative anesthesia and surgery-related 
      variables were obtained. The primary outcome was postoperative AKI defined by 
      acute kidney injury network criteria. The following machine learning techniques 
      were used: decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting machine, support 
      vector machine, naïve Bayes, multilayer perceptron, and deep belief networks. 
      These techniques were compared with logistic regression analysis regarding the 
      area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). AKI developed in 
      365 patients (30.1%). The performance in terms of AUROC was best in gradient 
      boosting machine among all analyses to predict AKI of all stages (0.90, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 0.86⁻0.93) or stage 2 or 3 AKI. The AUROC of logistic 
      regression analysis was 0.61 (95% CI 0.56⁻0.66). Decision tree and random forest 
      techniques showed moderate performance (AUROC 0.86 and 0.85, respectively). The 
      AUROC of support the vector machine, naïve Bayes, neural network, and deep belief 
      network was smaller than that of the other models. In our comparison of seven 
      machine learning approaches with logistic regression analysis, the gradient 
      boosting machine showed the best performance with the highest AUROC. An 
      internet-based risk estimator was developed based on our model of gradient 
      boosting. However, prospective studies are required to validate our results.

TI  - Improving the efficiency of the operating room environment with an optimization 
      and machine learning model.

AB  - The operating room is a major cost and revenue center for most hospitals. Thus, 
      more effective operating room management and scheduling can provide significant 
      benefits. In many hospitals, the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), where patients 
      recover after their surgical procedures, is a bottleneck. If the PACU reaches 
      capacity, patients must wait in the operating room until the PACU has available 
      space, leading to delays and possible cancellations for subsequent operating room 
      procedures. We develop a generalizable optimization and machine learning approach 
      to sequence operating room procedures to minimize delays caused by PACU 
      unavailability. Specifically, we use machine learning to estimate the required 
      PACU time for each type of surgical procedure, we develop and solve two integer 
      programming models to schedule procedures in the operating rooms to minimize 
      maximum PACU occupancy, and we use discrete event simulation to compare our 
      optimized schedule to the existing schedule. Using data from Lucile Packard 
      Children's Hospital Stanford, we show that the scheduling system can 
      significantly reduce operating room delays caused by PACU congestion while still 
      keeping operating room utilization high: simulation of the second half of 2016 
      shows that our model could have reduced total PACU holds by 76% without 
      decreasing operating room utilization. We are currently working on implementing 
      the scheduling system at the hospital.

TI  - Derivation and Validation of Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Acute Kidney 
      Injury after Cardiac Surgery.
LID - 10.3390/jcm7100322 [doi]
LID - 322
AB  - Machine learning approaches were introduced for better or comparable predictive 
      ability than statistical analysis to predict postoperative outcomes. We sought to 
      compare the performance of machine learning approaches with that of logistic 
      regression analysis to predict acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery. We 
      retrospectively reviewed 2010 patients who underwent open heart surgery and 
      thoracic aortic surgery. Baseline medical condition, intraoperative anesthesia, 
      and surgery-related data were obtained. The primary outcome was postoperative 
      acute kidney injury (AKI) defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving 
      Global Outcomes criteria. The following machine learning techniques were used: 
      decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, 
      neural network classifier, and deep learning. The performance of these techniques 
      was compared with that of logistic regression analysis regarding the area under 
      the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). During the first postoperative 
      week, AKI occurred in 770 patients (38.3%). The best performance regarding AUC 
      was achieved by the gradient boosting machine to predict the AKI of all stages 
      (0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75⁻0.80) or stage 2 or 3 AKI. The AUC of 
      logistic regression analysis was 0.69 (95% CI 0.66⁻0.72). Decision tree, random 
      forest, and support vector machine showed similar performance to logistic 
      regression. In our comprehensive comparison of machine learning approaches with 
      logistic regression analysis, gradient boosting technique showed the best 
      performance with the highest AUC and lower error rate. We developed an 
      Internet⁻based risk estimator which could be used for real-time processing of 
      patient data to estimate the risk of AKI at the end of surgery.

TI  - A Predictive Model for Determining Patients Not Requiring Prolonged Hospital 
      Length of Stay After Elective Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty.
PG  - 43-50
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000003798 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital length of stay (LOS) is an important quality metric for 
      total hip arthroplasty. Accurately predicting LOS is important to expectantly 
      manage bed utilization and other hospital resources. We aimed to develop a 
      predictive model for determining patients who do not require prolonged LOS. 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective single-institution study analyzing patients 
      undergoing elective unilateral primary total hip arthroplasty from 2014 to 2016. 
      The primary outcome of interest was LOS less than or equal to the expected 
      duration, defined as ≤3 days. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to 
      generate a model for this outcome, and a point-based calculator was designed. The 
      model was built on a training set, and performance was assessed on a validation 
      set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the 
      Hosmer-Lemeshow test were calculated to determine discriminatory ability and 
      goodness-of-fit, respectively. Predictive models using other machine learning 
      techniques (ridge regression, Lasso, and random forest) were created, and model 
      performances were compared. RESULTS: The point-based score calculator included 9 
      variables: age, opioid use, metabolic equivalents score, sex, anemia, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, obesity, and primary anesthesia 
      type. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the 
      calculator on the validation set was 0.735 (95% confidence interval, 0.675-0.787) 
      and demonstrated adequate goodness-of-fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P = .37). When 
      using a score of 12 as a threshold for predicting outcome, the positive 
      predictive value was 86.1%. CONCLUSIONS: A predictive model that can help 
      identify patients at higher odds for not requiring a prolonged hospital LOS was 
      developed and may aid hospital administrators in strategically planning bed 
      availability to reduce both overcrowding and underutilization when coordinating 
      with surgical volume.

TI  - Water exchange versus air insufflation for colonoscopy: A meta-analysis.
PG  - 311-316
LID - 10.4103/sjg.SJG_118_18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To compare water exchange (WE) method with conventional air 
      insufflation (AI) method for colonoscopy, evaluating the technical quality, 
      screening efficacy, and patients' acceptance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic 
      databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials comparing 
      WE colonoscopy with AI colonoscopy. The pooled data of procedure-associated and 
      patient-related outcomes were assessed, using the weighted mean difference (WMD) 
      with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous variables and relative risk (RR) 
      with 95% CI for dichotomous variables, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 13 
      studies involving 7056 patients were included. The cecum intubation rate was 
      similar between WE and AI methods (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.99-1.02,P = 0.37); 
      however, a significantly longer cecum intubation time was shown in WE group (WMD 
      = 1.56, 95% CI = 0.75-2.37,P = 0.002). Compared with AI, WE was associated with a 
      higher risk of adenoma detection rate (ADR) (RR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.18-1.38,P < 
      0.00001) and polyp detection rate (PDR) (RR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.21-1.39,P < 
      0.00001). Patients in WE group experienced significantly less maximum pain score 
      (WMD = -1.99, 95% CI = -2.68 to -1.30,P < 0.00001) and less requested on-demand 
      sedation (RR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.44-0.77,P = 0.0002). Likewise, they also 
      experienced less abdominal compression (RR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.51-0.74,P < 
      0.00001) and reposition (RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.63-0.86,P = 0.0001). Moreover, 
      patients' willingness to repeat colonoscopy was significantly greater for WE (RR 
      = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.07-1.21,P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis confirmed 
      that WE method could significantly increase ADR/PDR and improve patients' 
      acceptance of colonoscopy, while reducing the degree of pain and minimize the 
      need for on-demand sedation and adjunct maneuvers, despite requiring more cecal 
      intubation time.

TI  - Handover training for medical students: a controlled educational trial of a pilot 
      curriculum in Germany.
PG  - e021202
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-021202 [doi]
LID - e021202
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to implement and evaluate a newly developed 
      standardised handover curriculum for medical students. We sought to assess its 
      effect on students' awareness, confidence and knowledge regarding handover. 
      DESIGN: A controlled educational research study. SETTING: The pilot handover 
      training curriculum was integrated into a curriculum led by the Departments of 
      Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (AI) at the University Hospital. It consisted 
      of three modules integrated into a 4-week course of AI. Multiple types of 
      handover settings namely end-of-shift, operating room/postanaesthesia recovery 
      unit, intensive care unit, telephone and discharge were addressed. PARTICIPANTS: 
      A total of n=147 fourth-year medical students participated in this study, who 
      received either the current standard existing curriculum (no teaching of 
      handover, n=78) or the curriculum that incorporated the pilot handover training 
      (n=69). OUTCOME MEASURES: Paper-based questionnaires regarding attitude, 
      confidence and knowledge towards handover and patient safety were used for 
      pre-assessment and post-assessment. RESULTS: Students showed a significant 
      increase in knowledge (p<0.01) and self-confidence for the use of standardised 
      handover tools (p<0.01) as well as accurate handover performance (p<0.01) among 
      the pilot group. CONCLUSION: We implemented and evaluated a pilot curriculum for 
      undergraduate handover training. Students displayed a significant increase in 
      knowledge and self-confidence for the use of standardised handover tools and 
      accuracy in handover performance. Further studies should evaluate whether the 
      observed effect is sustained across time and is associated with patient benefit.

PG  - 723-731
LID - 10.1097/ACO.0000000000000659 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This narrative review will discuss what value Big Data has to 
      offer anesthesiology and aims to highlight recently published articles of large 
      databases exploring factors influencing perioperative outcome. Additionally, the 
      future perspectives of Big Data and its major pitfalls will be discussed. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: The potential of Big Data has given an incentive to create nationwide 
      and anesthesia-initiated registries like the MPOG and NACOR. These large 
      databases have contributed in elucidating some of the rare perioperative 
      complications, such as declined cognition after exposure to general anesthesia 
      and epidural hematomas in parturients. Additionally, they are useful in finding 
      patterns such as similar outcome in subtypes of beta-blockers and lower incidence 
      of pneumonia in preoperative influenza vaccinations in the elderly. SUMMARY: Big 
      Data is becoming increasingly popular with the collaborative collection of 
      registries offering anesthesia a way to explore rare perioperative complications 
      and outcome to encourage further hypotheses testing. Although Big Data has its 
      flaws in security, lack of expertise and methodological concerns, the future 
      potential of analytics combined with genomics, machine learning and real-time 
      decision support looks promising.

PG  - 1111-1123
LID - 10.2217/pgs-2018-0085 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Delayed recovery from general anesthesia is a well-known complication that 
      requires predictive tools and approaches. This study aimed to determine 
      significant factors associated with postanesthesia recovery and to develop an 
      algorithm for estimating recovery time from general anesthesia. MATERIALS & 
      METHODS: The genotypes of patients were determined by SNaPshot or ARMS-qPCR. The 
      algorithm was developed via machine-learning and tested by the worm plot. 
      RESULTS: Results showed that OPRM1 rs1799971 (p = 0.006) and ABCG2 rs2231142 (p 
      = 0.041) were significantly associated with recovery time. Ten factors after 
      random forest and stepwise selection were associated with recovery time. Ten 
      factors after random forest and stepwise selection were associated with recovery 
      time. Meanwhile, seven factors were associated with delayed recovery. CONCLUSION: 
      This study demonstrated that both clinical and pharmacogenetic data are 
      significantly associated with recovery from general anesthesia and provide the 
      basis for pre-emptive prediction tools.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to develop a predictive algorithm detecting 
      early signs of deterioration (ESODs) in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), 
      thus being able to intervene earlier in the future to avoid serious adverse 
      events. The algorithm must utilize continuously collected cardiopulmonary vital 
      signs and may serve as an alternative to current practice, in which an alarm is 
      activated by single parameters. METHODS: The study was a single center, 
      prospective cohort study including 178 patients admitted to the PACU after major 
      surgical procedures. Peripheral blood oxygenation, arterial blood pressure, 
      perfusion index, heart rate and respiratory rate were monitored continuously. 
      Potential ESODs were automatically detected and scored by two independent experts 
      with regards to the severity of the observation. Based on features extracted from 
      the obtained measurements, a random forest classifier was trained, classifying 
      each event being either an ESOD or not an ESOD. The algorithm was evaluated and 
      compared to the automated single modality alarm system at the PACU. RESULTS: The 
      algorithm detected ESODs with an accuracy of 92.2% (99% CI: 89.6%-94.8%), 
      sensitivity of 90.6% (99% CI: 85.7%-95.5%), specificity of 93.0% (99% CI: 
      89.9%-96.2%) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 96.9% 
      (99% CI: 95.3%-98.5%). The number of false alarms decreased by 85% (99% CI: 
      77%-93%) and the number of missed ESODs decreased by 73% (99% CI: 61%-85%) as 
      compared to the currently used alarm system in the hospital. The algorithm was 
      able to detect an ESOD in average 26.4 (99% CI: 1.1-51.7) minutes before the 
      current single parameter system used in the PACU. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the 
      proposed biomedical classification algorithm, when compared to the currently used 
      single parameter alarm system of the hospital, showed significantly increased 
      performance in both detecting ESODs fast and classifying these correctly. The 
      clinical effect of the predictive system must be evaluated in future trials.

      Hypotension.
PG  - 675-688
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000002374 [doi]
AB  - WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: 
      BACKGROUND:: Hypotension is a risk factor for adverse perioperative outcomes. 
      Machine-learning methods allow large amounts of data for development of robust 
      predictive analytics. The authors hypothesized that machine-learning methods can 
      provide prediction for the risk of postinduction hypotension. METHODS: Data was 
      extracted from the electronic health record of a single quaternary care center 
      from November 2015 to May 2016 for patients over age 12 that underwent general 
      anesthesia, without procedure exclusions. Multiple supervised machine-learning 
      classification techniques were attempted, with postinduction hypotension (mean 
      arterial pressure less than 55 mmHg within 10 min of induction by any 
      measurement) as primary outcome, and preoperative medications, medical 
      comorbidities, induction medications, and intraoperative vital signs as features. 
      Discrimination was assessed using cross-validated area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve. The best performing model was tuned and final 
      performance assessed using split-set validation. RESULTS: Out of 13,323 cases, 
      1,185 (8.9%) experienced postinduction hypotension. Area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve using logistic regression was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.70 
      to 0.72), support vector machines was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.60), naive Bayes 
      was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.69), k-nearest neighbor was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.63 to 
      0.65), linear discriminant analysis was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.73), random 
      forest was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.75), neural nets 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.71), 
      and gradient boosting machine 0.76 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.77). Test set area for the 
      gradient boosting machine was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      success of this technique in predicting postinduction hypotension demonstrates 
      feasibility of machine-learning models for predictive analytics in the field of 
      anesthesiology, with performance dependent on model selection and appropriate 
      tuning.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis through 
      severe diseases and stress courses leads to a rise in circulatory cortisol for an 
      adequate response to stress. This axis is one of the important systems that 
      involve in neuroendocrine response to the surgical stress. Hepatoadrenal syndrome 
      that is a manifestation of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in the course of liver 
      disease is described as insufficient production of steroid hormones mainly 
      cortisol due to primary dysfunction of the adrenal gland or secondary malfunction 
      of the HPA axis to provoke the adrenal gland leading to severe illness and 
      increased mortality. Through this evidence, we presented this question as to 
      whether cirrhotic patients have a greater mortality rate than other patients 
      after surgery and if the HPA axis is partly responsible for this phenomenon. Also 
      how the adrenal gland functions during surgery in cirrhotic rats. We conducted 
      this study to assess the effect of cirrhosis on the HPA axis through surgery in 
      cirrhotic rats by evaluating the changes in serum corticosterone level and blood 
      sugar before, immediately, and 30 minutes after surgery. METHOD: This study was 
      performed in the animal lab approved by the Ethics Committee of Tehran University 
      of Medical Sciences in 2014, on 25 male Wistar rats. Thioacetamide was used for 
      induction of cirrhosis in rats with new method of monitoring weekly changes of 
      rats' weight which had 100% success in procedure and reduction in mortality rate. 
      Laparotomy was performed on all of the rats during 9-12 in the morning within 
      10-15 minutes. Laparotomy was chosen as surgical stress because of its simplicity 
      and feasibility. Three blood samples were obtained from each rat immediately 
      after inducing anesthesia, immediately after the conclusion of surgery, and 30 
      minutes after surgery. The plasma concentration of corticosterone was measured 
      with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. P value of 0.05 or less was 
      considered as statistical significance. RESULT: Cirrhotic rat group consisted of 
      15 rats and control group consisted of 10 rats. There was a significant 
      difference in the mean level of corticosterone and blood sugar between the 
      cirrhotic rat group and control group in the 3 time levels (P=0.044/P < 0.001). 
      Pairwise comparison of mean corticosterone and blood sugar levels between case 
      (mean: 249.359 ± 3.90) and control (mean: 262.40 ± 4.69) showed a significant 
      difference (P=0.04, 95% CI = 0.30-25.79/P < 0.001, 95% CI = 129.62-233.96). 
      Unlike the control group, the level of serum corticosterone was compared in the 
      cirrhotic rat group (group 1) before, immediately, and 30 minutes after surgery, 
      which showed a significant difference in our study (P value  = 0.005). However, 
      this result was also significant in comparing the blood sugar in 3 time levels of 
      surgery in the control group (P value < 0.001) but not in the cirrhotic rat group 
      (P value = 0.233). CONCLUSION: There was a significant rise in corticosterone 
      levels during 3 time levels of surgery in cirrhotic rats; nevertheless, this 
      elevation was significantly lower than the control group. Also the mean level of 
      blood sugar was higher in the control group than in cirrhotic rats. However, this 
      difference was significant in comparison with the same times of surgery between 
      the two groups. These results approximately can substantiate our hypothesis that 
      AI in the field of cirrhosis would also affect the response of HPA axis to stress 
      during and after surgery that can be concomitant with higher rate of 
      cardiovascular unsteadiness incidences, deteriorating the severity of illness and 
      rise in mortality rate.

TI  - Correlations between brain changes and pain management after cognitive and 
      meditative therapies: A systematic review of neuroimaging studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are different ways of dealing with pain and cognitive and 
      meditative therapies (CMT) are alternative ways to regulate the emotions 
      associated with pain. Current studies apply neuroimaging techniques trying to 
      elucidate the neural mechanisms of cognitive strategies for pain. This systematic 
      review aimed to summarize the evidence on brain activity changes after CMT, which 
      include cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness and/or meditation, for pain 
      management as well as to evaluate clinical pain outcomes. METHODS: Electronic 
      databases - Pubmed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Science Direct, Scopus - were searched to 
      find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining neuroimaging data of CMT for 
      chronic pain patients or healthy individuals with experimental pain. Two 
      reviewers independently selected the relevant trials, rated for quality 
      assessment and extracted all data using a standardized form. Primary outcome was 
      brain activity changes (activation, deactivation or functional connectivity). 
      Secondary outcomes were pain intensity, self-management, pain coping, quality of 
      life, anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Nine RCTs were included involving 280 
      adults (18-59 years), 139 chronic pain patients vs. 148 healthy subjects. Three 
      main kinds of intervention were identified: cognitive-behavioral therapy (n = 4), 
      mindfulness meditation (n = 4) and transcendental meditation technique (n = 1). 
      Neuroimaging results revealed distinct patterns of activity, but the main 
      findings were related to increased activation of prefrontal cortex (PFC), 
      specially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal 
      cortex (vlPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OBF), somatosensory cortices (SSC) and 
      limbic system in chronic pain population; and increased activation of anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insular cortex (AI) and decreased activation of 
      thalamus in healthy individuals following CMT. CONCLUSION: This result means that 
      regulation of pain by CMT can alter functioning of brain regions in an extensive 
      network including non-nociceptive regions. CMT reduced the affective experience 
      of pain, while reductions of pain intensity ratings were less consistent. Brain 
      changes have been demonstrated as a result of the application of psychological 
      measures and may represent the clinical implications of changes in brain activity 
      or morphology.

TI  - Hospitalizations due to alcohol intoxication among children and adolescents - 
      data from one clinical hospital in Poland.
PG  - 387-398
LID - 67601 [pii]
LID - 10.12740/PP/67601 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of hospitalizations due to alcohol 
      intoxication (AI) at the Pediatric Health Center, and to attempt to identify 
      factors contributing to the occurrence of intoxication in the population of 
      children and adolescents. METHODS: Medical documentation of 227 patients 
      hospitalized due to AI. 108 (48%) patients were girls and 119 (52%) patients were 
      boys. The mean age of the study group was 14.9 years ±2.1. Data regarding 
      patients, their families and the circumstances of intoxication underwent 
      analysis. RESULTS: Alcohol intoxication constituted 2.8% of all hospitalizations. 
      The number of hospitalizations between 2000 and 2011 showed an increasing 
      tendency with some fluctuations within years. Spirits were predominant alcohol 
      beverages. Over 10% of patients required a short-term hospital stay at the 
      Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care. In 13% of children, coexisting 
      medicine or drug intoxication was observed and 10% of patients presented with 
      alcohol-related injury to the head or extremities. Risky sexual behaviors were 
      noted in 25% of girls. The majority of children were raised by two parents who 
      had received primary education. Alcoholism was present in over 20% of the 
      families. In single-parent families, fathers were more frequently absent and a 
      lack of a regular source of income was more often related to mothers. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There are no uniform standards of multi-specialist medical care for 
      children hospitalized due to AI. Identification of children consuming alcohol is 
      recommended. It should be done by primary physicians, pediatricians, teachers and 
      psychologists. Minor patients hospitalized due to AI should be provided with a 
      long-term and comprehensive care.

      for Assessing Pain in People With Dementia.
PG  - 117

AB  - Background: Pain in dementia is predominant particularly in the advanced stages 
      or in those who are unable to verbalize. Uncontrolled pain alters the course of 
      behaviors in patients with dementia making them perturbed, unsettled, and 
      devitalized. Current measures of assessing pain in this population group are 
      inadequate and underutilized in clinical practice because they lack systematic 
      evaluation and innovative design. Objective: To describe a novel method and 
      system of pain assessment using a combination of technologies: automated facial 
      recognition and analysis (AFRA), smart computing, affective computing, and cloud 
      computing (Internet of Things) for people with advanced dementia. Methods and 
      Results: Cognification and affective computing were used to conceptualize the 
      system. A computerized clinical system was developed to address the challenging 
      problem of identifying pain in non-verbal patients with dementia. The system is 
      composed of a smart device enabled app (App) linked to a web admin portal (WAP). 
      The App "PainChek™" uses AFRA to identify facial action units indicative of pain 
      presence, and user-fed clinical information to calculate a pain intensity score. 
      The App has various functionalities including: pain assessment, pain monitoring, 
      patient profiling, and data synchronization (into the WAP). The WAP serves as a 
      database that collects the data obtained through the App in the clinical setting. 
      These technologies can assist in addressing the various characteristics of pain 
      (e.g., subjectivity, multidimensionality, and dynamicity). With over 750 paired 
      assessments conducted, the App has been validated in two clinical studies (n = 
      74, age: 60-98 y), which showed sound psychometric properties: excellent 
      concurrent validity (r = 0.882-0.911), interrater reliability (Kw = 0.74-0.86), 
      internal consistency (α = 0.925-0.950), and excellent test-retest reliability 
      (ICC = 0.904), while it possesses good predictive validity and discriminant 
      validity. Clinimetric data revealed high accuracy (95.0%), sensitivity (96.1%), 
      and specificity (91.4%) as well as excellent clinical utility (0.95). 
      Conclusions: PainChek™ is a comprehensive and evidence-based pain management 
      system. This novel approach has the potential to transform pain assessment in 
      people who are unable to verbalize because it can be used by clinicians and 
      carers in everyday clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A common limiting factor in the throughput of gastrointestinal 
      endoscopy units is the availability of space for patients to recover 
      post-procedure. This study sought to identify predictors of abnormally long 
      recovery time after colonoscopy performed with procedural sedation. In clinical 
      research, this type of study would be performed using only one regression 
      modeling approach. A goal of this study was to apply various "machine learning" 
      techniques to see if better prediction could be achieved. METHODS: Procedural 
      data for 31,442 colonoscopies performed on 29,905 adult patients at Massachusetts 
      General Hospital from 2011 to 2015 were analyzed to identify potential predictors 
      of long recovery times. These data included the identities of hospital personnel, 
      and the initial statistical analysis focused on the impact of these personnel on 
      recovery time via multivariate logistic regression. Secondary analyses included 
      more information on patient vitals both to identify secondary predictors and to 
      predict long recoveries using more complex techniques. RESULTS: In univariate 
      analysis, the endoscopist, procedure room nurse, recovery room nurse, and 
      surgical technician all showed a statistically significant relationship to long 
      recovery times, with p-value below 0.0001 in all cases. In the multivariate 
      logistic regression, the most significant predictor of a long recovery time was 
      the identity of the recovery room nurse, with the endoscopist also showing a 
      statistically significant relationship with a weaker effect. Complex techniques 
      led to a negligible improvement over simple techniques in prediction of long 
      recovery periods. CONCLUSION: The hospital personnel involved in performing a 
      colonoscopy show a strong association with the likelihood of a patient spending 
      an abnormally long time recovering from the procedure, with the most pronounced 
      effect for the nurse in the recovery room. The application of more advanced 
      approaches to improve prediction in this clinical data set only yielded modest 
      improvements.

PG  - 523-529

AB  - GOALS: To assess the factors associated with adenoma detection in 
      propofol-sedated patients. BACKGROUNDS: Low adenoma detection rate (ADR) are 
      linked to increased risk of interval cancer and related deaths. Compared with air 
      insufflation (AI) colonoscopy, the method of water exchange (WE) significantly 
      decreased insertion pain and increased ADR in unsedated patients. Deep sedation 
      with propofol has been increasingly used in colonoscopy. One report suggested 
      that WE significantly increased ADR in propofol-sedated patients, but the factors 
      associated with adenoma detection were not analyzed. STUDY: Post hoc multiple 
      logistic regression analyses were performed based on pooled data from 2 
      randomized controlled trials to assess the factors associated with adenoma 
      detection in propofol-sedated patients. RESULTS: Propofol-sedated patients 
      (n=510) were randomized to AI and WE. The baseline characteristics were 
      comparable. Multiple logistic regression analyses show that age, withdrawal time, 
      indications (screening vs. diagnostic), and WE were significantly and 
      independently associated with higher ADR. WE had fewer patients with inadequate 
      Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score of <6. Despite a significantly shorter 
      inspection time, WE had significantly higher overall ADR than AI, especially in 
      those with adequate Boston Bowel Preparation Scale of ≥6. Right colon ADR (17.5% 
      vs. 10.5%), flat ADR (32.3% vs. 19.4%), combined advanced and sessile serrated 
      ADR (13.1% vs. 7.4%) of WE were significantly higher than those of AI. 
      CONCLUSIONS: WE enhanced quality of colonoscopy in propofol-sedated patients by 
      significantly improving colon cleanliness and overall ADR. Colonoscopists with 
      patients under propofol sedation might consider evaluating WE method for 
      performance improvement.

TI  - Evidence Review Conducted for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
      Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery: Focus on Anesthesiology 
      for Total Knee Arthroplasty.
PG  - 441-453
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000003564 [doi]
AB  - Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has rapidly gained popularity in a variety 
      of surgical subspecialities. A large body of literature suggests that ERAS leads 
      to superior outcomes, improved patient satisfaction, reduced length of hospital 
      stay, and cost benefits, without affecting rates of readmission after surgery. 
      These patterns have been described for patients undergoing elective total knee 
      arthroplasty (TKA); however, adoption of ERAS to orthopedic surgery has lagged 
      behind other surgical disciplines. The Agency for Healthcare Research and 
      Quality, in partnership with the American College of Surgeons and the Johns 
      Hopkins Medicine Armstrong Institute (AI) for Patient Safety and Quality, has 
      developed the Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery. The 
      program comprises a national effort to incorporate best practice in perioperative 
      care and improve patient safety, for over 750 hospitals and multiple procedures 
      over the next 5 years, including orthopedic surgery. We have conducted a full 
      evidence review of anesthetic interventions to derive anesthesiology-related 
      components of an evidence-based ERAS pathway for TKA. A PubMed search was 
      performed for each protocol component, focusing on the highest levels of evidence 
      in the literature. Search findings are summarized in narrative format. 
      Anesthesiology components of care were identified and evaluated across the pre-, 
      intra-, and postoperative phases. A summary of the best available evidence, 
      together with recommendations for inclusion in ERAS protocols for TKA, is 
      provided. There is extensive evidence in the literature, and from society 
      guidelines to support the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Safety 
      Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery goals for TKA.

AB  - Rhythmic neuronal synchronization across large-scale networks is thought to play 
      a key role in the regulation of conscious states. Changes in neuronal oscillation 
      amplitude across states of consciousness have been widely reported, but little is 
      known about possible changes in the temporal dynamics of these oscillations. The 
      temporal structure of brain oscillations may provide novel insights into the 
      neural mechanisms underlying consciousness. To address this question, we examined 
      long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of EEG oscillation amplitudes recorded 
      during both wakefulness and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Importantly, the 
      time-varying EEG oscillation envelopes were assessed over the course of a 
      sevoflurane sedation protocol during which the participants alternated between 
      states of consciousness and unconsciousness. Both spectral power and LRTC in 
      oscillation amplitude were computed across multiple frequency bands. 
      State-dependent differences in these features were assessed using non-parametric 
      tests and supervised machine learning. We found that periods of unconsciousness 
      were associated with increases in LRTC in beta (15-30Hz) amplitude over 
      frontocentral channels and with a suppression of alpha (8-13Hz) amplitude over 
      occipitoparietal electrodes. Moreover, classifiers trained to predict states of 
      consciousness on single epochs demonstrated that the combination of beta LRTC 
      with alpha amplitude provided the highest classification accuracy (above 80%). 
      These results suggest that loss of consciousness is accompanied by an 
      augmentation of temporal persistence in neuronal oscillation amplitude, which may 
      reflect an increase in regularity and a decrease in network repertoire compared 
      to the brain's activity during resting-state consciousness.

      anesthetic depth.
PG  - 431-438
LID - 10.1097/ACO.0000000000000618 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Electroencephalography (EEG) was introduced into anesthesia 
      practice in the 1990s as a tool to titrate anesthetic depth. However, limitations 
      in current analysis techniques have called into question whether these techniques 
      improve standard of care, or instead call for improved, more ubiquitously 
      applicable measures to assess anesthetic transitions and depth. This review 
      highlights emerging analytical approaches and techniques from neuroscience 
      research that have the potential to better capture anesthetic transitions to 
      provide better measurements of anesthetic depth. RECENT FINDINGS: Since the 
      introduction of electroencephalography, neuroscientists, engineers, 
      mathematicians, and clinicians have all been developing new ways of analyzing 
      continuous electrical signals. Collaborations between these fields have 
      proliferated several analytical techniques that demonstrate how anesthetics 
      affect brain dynamics and conscious transitions. Here, we review techniques in 
      the following categories: network science, integration and information, nonlinear 
      dynamics, and artificial intelligence. SUMMARY: Up-and-coming techniques have the 
      potential to better clinically define and characterize altered consciousness time 
      points. Such new techniques used alongside traditional measures have the 
      potential to improve depth of anesthesia measurements and enhance an 
      understanding of how the brain is affected by anesthetic agents. However, new 
      measures will be needed to be tested for robustness in real-world environments 
      and on diverse experimental protocols.

TI  - Changes in the augmentation index and postoperative orthostatic intolerance in 
      orthopedic surgery: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 1012-1028
LID - 10.1007/s12630-018-1149-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative orthostatic intolerance (OI) can be a major obstacle to 
      early ambulation and its determinants are poorly understood. We aimed to study 
      postoperative changes in vascular tone and their potential association with OI in 
      various orthopedic surgical settings. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 
      350 patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty under neuraxial anesthesia or 
      spine surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. We determined the 
      augmentation index (AI) as a measure of vascular tone and studied symptoms of OI 
      using a validated questionnaire at various postoperative time points. RESULTS: 
      The AI was significantly reduced postoperatively (at spinal resolution in 
      patients with neuraxial anesthesia or two hours postoperatively in general 
      anesthesia) compared with baseline values in all procedures and did not 
      subsequently return to baseline throughout the postoperative period in the 
      majority of patients [252/335 (75.2%); P < 0.001]. The majority [260/342 (76.0%); 
      P < 0.001] of patients had postoperative symptoms of OI. Nevertheless, no 
      association was found between postoperative change in AI from baseline and 
      postoperative symptoms of OI. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly prolonged decrease in 
      AI and symptoms of OI are common after orthopedic surgery. Nevertheless, an 
      association between the two measures was not observed. While compensatory 
      mechanisms may limit the influence of an AI decrease on symptoms of OI, more 
      research is needed to understand the contributing factors and aid in the 
      identification of patients at risk of OI.

AB  - Conventionally inseminated spermatozoa suffer a dramatic reduction in numbers 
      during their long journey until fertilization. In addition sperm survival seems 
      to be strongly affected by the reconstitution of the female reproductive tract in 
      the post partum period. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel AI 
      technique for cattle that allows the deposition of spermatozoa directly into the 
      ampulla in the immediate vicinity of the fertilization site. This new 
      reproductive biotechnique was investigated with focus on semen origin, sperm 
      dosage, semen preparation and time of insemination. Finally, a first practical 
      application was carried out by inseminating superovulated heifers with sex-sorted 
      semen. In total, 49 Simmental heifers were used for 65 intratubal inseminations 
      (ITI) with single ovulation and 8 ITIs after superovulation, respectively. 
      Insemination into the oviduct was performed under epidural anesthesia via 
      transvaginal endoscopy using a curved glass capillary loaded with semen. Two days 
      later the oviduct and the adjacent uterine horn were endoscopically flushed and 
      embryos or unfertilized oocytes were collected for determination of fertilization 
      success. Across all experimental groups, tubal insemination successfully resulted 
      in the collection of embryos; however, first tubal AI attempts and ITIs close to 
      ovulation led to low recovery rates. In total, 109 complexes were flushed from 
      ITIs in superstimulated heifers (n = 8) using sex sorted semen, of which 24 (22%) 
      were at the embryo stage. In conclusion, it was shown that intratubal 
      insemination can be successfully used for semen deposition, thus bypassing the 
      lower female genital tract. Factors such as time of insemination, semen 
      processing and semen quantity for superovulatory use should be further 
      investigated.

AB  - There have been many attempts to incorporate automation into the practice of 
      anesthesiology, though none have been successful. Fundamentally, these failures 
      are due to the underlying complexity of anesthesia practice and the inability of 
      rule-based feedback loops to fully master it. Recent innovations in artificial 
      intelligence, especially machine learning, may usher in a new era of automation 
      across many industries, including anesthesiology. It would be wise to consider 
      the implications of such potential changes before they have been fully realized.

TI  - A comparison of the effects of carbon dioxide and medical air for abdominal 
      insufflation on respiratory parameters in xylazine-sedated sheep undergoing 
      laparoscopic artificial insemination.
PG  - 167-171
LID - 10.1080/00480169.2018.1458661 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To determine if abdominal insufflation with medical air will improve 
      oxygenation and ventilation parameters when compared to insufflation with CO(2) 
      in xylazine-sedated sheep undergoing laparoscopic artificial insemination (AI). 
      METHODS: Forty-seven sheep underwent oestrus synchronisation and were fasted for 
      24 hours prior to laparoscopic AI. Each animal was randomised to receive either 
      CO(2) or medical air for abdominal insufflation. An auricular arterial catheter 
      was placed and utilised for serial blood sampling. Respiratory rates (RR) and 
      arterial blood samples were collected at baseline, after xylazine (0.1 mg/kg I/V) 
      sedation, 2 minutes after Trendelenburg positioning, 5 minutes after abdominal 
      insufflation, and 10 minutes after being returned to a standing position. Blood 
      samples were collected in heparinised syringes, stored on ice, and analysed for 
      arterial pH, partial pressure of arterial O(2) (PaO(2)), and CO(2) (PaCO(2)). The 
      number of ewes conceiving to AI was also determined. RESULTS: Repeated measures 
      ANOVA demonstrated temporal effects on RR, PaO(2), PaCO(2) and arterial pH during 
      the laparoscopic AI procedure (p<0.001), but no difference between insufflation 
      groups (p>0.01). No sheep experienced hypercapnia (PaCO(2)>50 mmHg) or acidaemia 
      (pH<7.35). Hypoxaemia (PaO(2)<70 mmHg) was diagnosed during the procedure in 
      14/22 (64%) ewes in the CO(2) group compared with 8/23 (35%) ewes in the medical 
      air group (p=0.053). Overall, 15/20 (75%) ewes in the CO(2) group conceived to AI 
      compared with 16/22 (72.7%) in the medical air group (p=0.867). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There were no statistical or clinical differences in RR, 
      PaO(2), PaCO(2), pH, or conception to AI when comparing the effects of CO(2) and 
      medical air as abdominal insufflation gases. None of the sheep experienced 
      hypercapnia or acidaemic, yet 42% (19/45) of sheep developed clinical hypoxaemia, 
      with a higher percentage of ewes in the CO(2) group developing hypoxaemia than in 
      the medical air group. Based on the overall analysis, medical air could be 
      utilised as a comparable alternative for abdominal insufflation during 
      laparoscopic AI procedures.

TI  - Face and content validity of variables associated with the difficult-to-sedate 
      child in the paediatric intensive care unit: A survey of paediatric critical care 
      clinicians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians recognise that some critically ill children are 
      difficult-to-sedate. It may be possible to identify this clinical phenotype for 
      sedation response using statistical modelling techniques adopted from machine 
      learning. This requires identification of a finite number of variables to include 
      in the statistical model. OBJECTIVE: To establish face and content validity for 
      17 candidate variables identified in the international literature as 
      characteristic of the difficult-to-sedate child phenotype. METHODS: Paediatric 
      critical care clinicians rated the relevance of 17 variables characterising the 
      difficult-to-sedate child using a four-point scale ranging from not (1) to highly 
      relevant (4). Face and content validity of these variables were assessed by 
      calculating a mean score for each item and computing an item-level content 
      validity index. Items with a mean score >1 were rated as having adequate face 
      validity. An item-level content validity index ≥0.70 indicated good to excellent 
      content validity. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Web-based survey emailed to members 
      of the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators Network or the 
      Society of Critical Care Medicine Pediatric Sedation Study Group. RESULTS: Of 411 
      possible respondents, 121 useable surveys were returned for a response rate of 
      29%. All items had a mean score >1, indicating adequate face validity. Ten of 17 
      items scored an item-level content validity index ≥0.70. The highest scoring 
      items were requiring three or more sedation classes simultaneously, daily modal 
      sedation score indicating agitation, sedation score indicating agitation for 2 
      consecutive hours, receiving sedatives at a dose >90th percentile of the usual 
      starting dose, and receiving intermittent paralytic doses for sedation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Computation of an item-level content validity index validated 
      variables to include in statistical modelling of the difficult-to-sedate 
      phenotype. The results indicate consensus among paediatric critical care 
      clinicians that the majority of candidate variables identified through literature 
      review are characteristic of the difficult-to-sedate child.

TI  - Brom Aortoplasty for Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis.
PG  - 139-146
LID - 10.1177/2150135118754520 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy remains regarding the optimal surgical approach for 
      children with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS). METHODS: Since 1997 we have 
      used Brom three-patch aortoplasty for patients with SVAS. We prefer computed 
      tomography (CT) imaging for preoperative evaluation rather than cardiac 
      catheterization as it avoids the well-known morbidity of general anesthesia. The 
      purpose of this study was to present our intermediate-term results of this 
      strategy. RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients with SVAS were treated with Brom 
      aortoplasty. Mean age was 3.7 ± 5.9 years (median, 1.5 years). Twelve patients 
      had Williams syndrome. Ten patients had preoperative advanced medical imaging 
      (seven CT, three magnetic resonance imaging) and did not have cardiac 
      catheterization. Mean times for cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp were 172 ± 
      29 minutes and 110 ± 21 minutes, respectively. Ten patients had simultaneous 
      pulmonary artery stenosis patching. Median length of stay was seven days. There 
      was no operative or late mortality. Mean follow-up was 6 ± 5 years. There were no 
      reoperations on the aortic root. Fifteen patients had mild or less aortic 
      insufficiency (AI) and two had moderate AI. One patient who had infant balloon 
      dilation of the aortic valve and postoperative subacute bacterial endocarditis 
      had moderate-to-severe AI and aortic stenosis (AS). One patient had moderate 
      residual SVAS; all others had no AS. No patients had late coronary insufficiency. 
      CONCLUSION: Brom aortoplasty promotes restoration of normal aortic root geometry 
      and relief of coronary ostial stenosis, which is important in preventing 
      myocardial ischemia. Computed tomography imaging is our preferred diagnostic 
      modality. Intermediate-term outcomes are excellent with no recurrent SVAS, 
      coronary events, or reoperations on the aortic valve.

TI  - Artificial neural networks can be effectively used to model changes of 
      intracranial pressure (ICP) during spinal surgery using different noninvasive ICP 
      surrogate estimators.
PG  - 288-296
LID - 10.23736/S0390-5616.18.04299-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques play a major role in 
      anesthesiology, even though their importance is often overlooked. In the extant 
      literature, AI approaches, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been 
      underutilized, being used mainly to model patient's consciousness state, to 
      predict the precise number of anesthetic gases, the level of analgesia, or the 
      need of anesthesiological blocks, among others. In the field of neurosurgery, 
      ANNs have been effectively applied to the diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral 
      tumors, seizures, low back pain, and also to the monitoring of intracranial 
      pressure (ICP). METHODS: A multilayer perceptron (MLP), which is a feedforward 
      ANN, with hyperbolic tangent as activation function in the input/hidden layers, 
      softmax as activation function in the output layer, and cross-entropy as error 
      function, was used to model the impact of prone versus supine position and the 
      use of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) on ICP in a sample of 30 patients 
      undergoing spinal surgery. Different noninvasive surrogate estimations of ICP 
      have been used and compared: namely, mean optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), 
      noninvasive estimated cerebral perfusion pressure (NCPP), Pulsatility Index (PI), 
      ICP derived from PI (ICP-PI), and flow velocity diastolic formula (FVDICP). 
      RESULTS: ONSD proved to be a more robust surrogate estimation of ICP, with a 
      predictive power of 75%, whilst the power of NCPP, ICP-PI, PI, and FVDICP were 
      60.5%, 54.8%, 53.1%, and 47.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our MLP analysis 
      confirmed our findings previously obtained with regression, correlation, 
      multivariate receiving operator curve (multi-ROC) analyses. ANNs can be 
      successfully used to predict the effects of prone versus supine position and PEEP 
      on ICP in patients undergoing spinal surgery using different noninvasive 
      surrogate estimators of ICP.

TI  - Objectively measuring pain using facial expression: is the technology finally 
      ready?
PG  - 105-113
LID - 10.2217/pmt-2017-0049 [doi]
AB  - Currently, clinicians observe pain-related behaviors and use patient self-report 
      measures in order to determine pain severity. This paper reviews the evidence 
      when facial expression is used as a measure of pain. We review the literature 
      reporting the relevance of facial expression as a diagnostic measure, which 
      facial movements are indicative of pain, and whether such movements can be 
      reliably used to measure pain. We conclude that although the technology for 
      objective pain measurement is not yet ready for use in clinical settings, the 
      potential benefits to patients in improved pain management, combined with the 
      advances being made in sensor technology and artificial intelligence, provide 
      opportunities for research and innovation.

TI  - Acupuncture versus medication for pain management: a cross-sectional study of 
      breast cancer survivors.
PG  - 80-87
LID - 10.1136/acupmed-2017-011435 [doi]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Breast cancer survivors who take aromatase inhibitors (AI) 
      often suffer from chronic pain. Emerging evidence supports the use of acupuncture 
      as an effective pain management strategy for this condition, but its 
      acceptability among cancer survivors is unknown. We evaluated breast cancer 
      survivors' preferences for acupuncture as compared with medication use and 
      identified factors predictive of this preference. METHODS: We conducted a 
      cross-sectional study among breast cancer survivors who were currently, or had 
      been, taking an AI. The primary outcome was degree of preference for acupuncture 
      as compared with medication for pain management. We conducted multivariate 
      logistic regression analyses to evaluate the effects of socioeconomic status 
      (SES) factors and health beliefs on treatment preference. RESULTS: Among 592 
      participants, 160 (27.0%) preferred acupuncture, 153 (25.8%) preferred medication 
      and 279 (47.1%) had no clear preference. In a multivariate analysis that only 
      included SES, higher education and white race were significantly associated with 
      greater preference for acupuncture. When health beliefs were added, SES effects 
      were attenuated, while greater expectation of acupuncture's effect, lower 
      perceived barriers to its use, higher social norm (endorsement from family 
      members and healthcare professionals) related to acupuncture and higher holistic 
      health beliefs were associated with greater preference for acupuncture. 
      CONCLUSION: We found similar rates of preference for acupuncture versus 
      medication among breast cancer survivors for pain management. Specific attitudes 
      and beliefs predicted such preferences, highlighting the importance of a 
      patient-centred approach to align patient beliefs and preferences with 
      therapeutic options for more effective pain management. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Augmented Personalized Health: How Smart Data with IoTs and AI is about to Change 
      Healthcare.
LID - 10.1109/RTSI.2017.8065963 [doi]
AB  - Healthcare as we know it is in the process of going through a massive change - 
      from episodic to continuous, from disease focused to wellness and quality of life 
      focused, from clinic centric to anywhere a patient is, from clinician controlled 
      to patient empowered, and from being driven by limited data to 360-degree, 
      multimodal personal-public-population physical-cyber-social big data driven. 
      While ability to create and capture data is already here, the upcoming 
      innovations will be in converting this big data into smart data through 
      contextual and personalized processing such that patients and clinicians can make 
      better decisions and take timely actions for augmented personalized health. This 
      paper outlines current opportunities and challenges, with a focus on key AI 
      approaches to make this a reality. The broader vision is exemplified using three 
      ongoing applications (asthma in children, bariatric surgery, and pain management) 
      as part of the Kno.e.sis kHealth personalized digital health initiative.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Use of opioids for pain management has increased over the past decade; 
      however, inadequate analgesic response is common. Genetic variability may be 
      related to opioid efficacy, but due to the many possible combinations and 
      variables, statistical computations may be difficult. This study investigated 
      whether data processing with support vector machine learning could predict 
      required opioid dose in cancer pain patients, using genetic profiling. Eighteen 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the µ and δ opioid receptor genes 
      and the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene were selected for analysis. RESULTS: 
      Data from 1237 cancer pain patients were included in the analysis. Support vector 
      machine learning did not find any associations between the assessed SNPs and 
      opioid dose in cancer pain patients, and hence, did not provide additional 
      information regarding prediction of required opioid dose using genetic profiling.

TI  - The Association Between Ventilator Dyssynchrony, Delivered Tidal Volume, and 
      Sedation Using a Novel Automated Ventilator Dyssynchrony Detection Algorithm.
PG  - e151-e157
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000002849 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventilator dyssynchrony is potentially harmful to patients with or at 
      risk for the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Automated detection of 
      ventilator dyssynchrony from ventilator waveforms has been difficult. It is 
      unclear if certain types of ventilator dyssynchrony deliver large tidal volumes 
      and whether levels of sedation alter the frequency of ventilator dyssynchrony. 
      DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: A university medical ICU. 
      PATIENTS: Patients with or at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Continuous pressure-time, flow-time, and volume-time data were 
      directly obtained from the ventilator. The level of sedation and the use of 
      neuromuscular blockade was extracted from the medical record. Machine learning 
      algorithms that incorporate clinical insight were developed and trained to detect 
      four previously described and clinically relevant forms of ventilator 
      dyssynchrony. The association between normalized tidal volume and ventilator 
      dyssynchrony and the association between sedation and the frequency of ventilator 
      dyssynchrony were determined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 4.26 
      million breaths were recorded from 62 ventilated patients. Our algorithm detected 
      three types of ventilator dyssynchrony with an area under the receiver operator 
      curve of greater than 0.89. Ventilator dyssynchrony occurred in 34.4% (95% CI, 
      34.41-34.49%) of breaths. When compared with synchronous breaths, 
      double-triggered and flow-limited breaths were more likely to deliver tidal 
      volumes greater than 10 mL/kg (40% and 11% compared with 0.2%; p < 0.001 for both 
      comparisons). Deep sedation reduced but did not eliminate the frequency of all 
      ventilator dyssynchrony breaths (p < 0.05). Ventilator dyssynchrony was 
      eliminated with neuromuscular blockade (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We developed a 
      computerized algorithm that accurately detects three types of ventilator 
      dyssynchrony. Double-triggered and flow-limited breaths are associated with the 
      frequent delivery of tidal volumes of greater than 10 mL/kg. Although ventilator 
      dyssynchrony is reduced by deep sedation, potentially deleterious tidal volumes 
      may still be delivered. However, neuromuscular blockade effectively eliminates 
      ventilator dyssynchrony.

AB  - Anesthesia information management systems (AIMS) have evolved from simple, 
      automated intraoperative record keepers in a select few institutions to widely 
      adopted, sophisticated hardware and software solutions that are integrated into a 
      hospital's electronic health record system and used to manage and document a 
      patient's entire perioperative experience. AIMS implementations have resulted in 
      numerous billing, research, and clinical benefits, yet there remain challenges 
      and areas of potential improvement to AIMS utilization. This article provides an 
      overview of the history of AIMS, the components and features of AIMS, and the 
      benefits and challenges associated with implementing and using AIMS. As AIMS 
      continue to proliferate and data are increasingly shared across 
      multi-institutional collaborations, visual analytics and advanced analytics 
      techniques such as machine learning may be applied to AIMS data to reap even more 
      benefits.

TI  - Examining the Ability of Artificial Neural Networks Machine Learning Models to 
      Accurately Predict Complications Following Posterior Lumbar Spine Fusion.
PG  - 853-860
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000002442 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional database study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study 
      was to train and validate machine learning models to identify risk factors for 
      complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND 
      DATA: Machine learning models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are 
      valuable tools for analyzing and interpreting large and complex datasets. ANNs 
      have yet to be used for risk factor analysis in orthopedic surgery. METHODS: The 
      American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 
      (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried for patients who underwent posterior lumbar 
      spine fusion. This query returned 22,629 patients, 70% of whom were used to train 
      our models, and 30% were used to evaluate the models. The predictive variables 
      used included sex, age, ethnicity, diabetes, smoking, steroid use, coagulopathy, 
      functional status, American Society for Anesthesiology (ASA) class ≥3, body mass 
      index (BMI), pulmonary comorbidities, and cardiac comorbidities. The models were 
      used to predict cardiac complications, wound complications, venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE), and mortality. Using ASA class as a benchmark for 
      prediction, area under receiver operating curves (AUC) was used to determine the 
      accuracy of our machine learning models. RESULTS: On the basis of AUC values, ANN 
      and LR both outperformed ASA class for predicting all four types of 
      complications. ANN was the most accurate for predicting cardiac complications, 
      and LR was most accurate for predicting wound complications, VTE, and mortality, 
      though ANN and LR had comparable AUC values for predicting all types of 
      complications. ANN had greater sensitivity than LR for detecting wound 
      complications and mortality. CONCLUSION: Machine learning in the form of logistic 
      regression and ANNs were more accurate than benchmark ASA scores for identifying 
      risk factors of developing complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion, 
      suggesting they are potentially great tools for risk factor analysis in spine 
      surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

      pediatric patients: a preliminary experience.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Cerebral mapping for surgical planning and operative guidance is a 
      challenging task in neurosurgery. Pediatric patients are often poor candidates 
      for many modern mapping techniques because of inability to cooperate due to their 
      immature age, cognitive deficits, or other factors. Resting-state functional MRI 
      (rs-fMRI) is uniquely suited to benefit pediatric patients because it is 
      inherently noninvasive and does not require task performance or significant 
      cooperation. Recent advances in the field have made mapping cerebral networks 
      possible on an individual basis for use in clinical decision making. The authors 
      present their initial experience translating rs-fMRI into clinical practice for 
      surgical planning in pediatric patients. METHODS The authors retrospectively 
      reviewed cases in which the rs-fMRI analysis technique was used prior to 
      craniotomy in pediatric patients undergoing surgery in their institution. 
      Resting-state analysis was performed using a previously trained machine-learning 
      algorithm for identification of resting-state networks on an individual basis. 
      Network maps were uploaded to the clinical imaging and surgical navigation 
      systems. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics, including need for 
      sedation during imaging and use of task-based fMRI, were also recorded. RESULTS 
      Twenty patients underwent rs-fMRI prior to craniotomy between December 2013 and 
      June 2016. Their ages ranged from 1.9 to 18.4 years, and 12 were male. Five of 
      the 20 patients also underwent task-based fMRI and one underwent awake 
      craniotomy. Six patients required sedation to tolerate MRI acquisition, including 
      resting-state sequences. Exemplar cases are presented including anatomical and 
      resting-state functional imaging. CONCLUSIONS Resting-state fMRI is a rapidly 
      advancing field of study allowing for whole brain analysis by a noninvasive 
      modality. It is applicable to a wide range of patients and effective even under 
      general anesthesia. The nature of resting-state analysis precludes any need for 
      task cooperation. These features make rs-fMRI an ideal technology for cerebral 
      mapping in pediatric neurosurgical patients. This review of the use of rs-fMRI 
      mapping in an initial pediatric case series demonstrates the feasibility of 
      utilizing this technique in pediatric neurosurgical patients. The preliminary 
      experience presented here is a first step in translating this technique to a 
      broader clinical practice.

TI  - Prediction of Bispectral Index during Target-controlled Infusion of Propofol and 
      Remifentanil: A Deep Learning Approach.
PG  - 492-501
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000001892 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The discrepancy between predicted effect-site concentration and 
      measured bispectral index is problematic during intravenous anesthesia with 
      target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. We hypothesized that 
      bispectral index during total intravenous anesthesia would be more accurately 
      predicted by a deep learning approach. METHODS: Long short-term memory and the 
      feed-forward neural network were sequenced to simulate the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic parts of an empirical model, respectively, to predict 
      intraoperative bispectral index during combined use of propofol and remifentanil. 
      Inputs of long short-term memory were infusion histories of propofol and 
      remifentanil, which were retrieved from target-controlled infusion pumps for 
      1,800 s at 10-s intervals. Inputs of the feed-forward network were the outputs of 
      long short-term memory and demographic data such as age, sex, weight, and height. 
      The final output of the feed-forward network was the bispectral index. The 
      performance of bispectral index prediction was compared between the deep learning 
      model and previously reported response surface model. RESULTS: The model 
      hyperparameters comprised 8 memory cells in the long short-term memory layer and 
      16 nodes in the hidden layer of the feed-forward network. The model training and 
      testing were performed with separate data sets of 131 and 100 cases. The 
      concordance correlation coefficient (95% CI) were 0.561 (0.560 to 0.562) in the 
      deep learning model, which was significantly larger than that in the response 
      surface model (0.265 [0.263 to 0.266], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning 
      model-predicted bispectral index during target-controlled infusion of propofol 
      and remifentanil more accurately compared to the traditional model. The deep 
      learning approach in anesthetic pharmacology seems promising because of its 
      excellent performance and extensibility.

TI  - Machine Learning Models of Post-Intubation Hypoxia During General Anesthesia.
PG  - 212-216
AB  - Fine-meshed perioperative measurements are offering enormous potential for 
      automatically investigating clinical complications during general anesthesia. In 
      this study, we employed multiple machine learning methods to model perioperative 
      hypoxia and compare their respective capabilities. After exporting and 
      visualizing 620 series of perioperative vital signs, we had ten anesthesiologists 
      annotate the subjective presence and severity of temporary post-intubation oxygen 
      desaturation. We then applied specific clustering and prediction methods on the 
      acquired annotations, and evaluated their performance in comparison to the 
      inter-rater agreement between experts. When reproducing the expert annotations, 
      the sensitivity and specificity of multi-layer neural networks substantially 
      outperformed clustering and simpler threshold-based methods. The achieved 
      performance of our best automated hypoxia models thereby approximately equaled 
      the observed agreement between different medical experts. Furthermore, we 
      deployed our classification methods for processing unlabeled inputs to estimate 
      the incidence of hypoxic episodes in another sizeable patient cohort, which 
      attests to the feasibility of using the approach on a larger scale. We interpret 
      that our machine learning models could be instrumental for computerized 
      observational studies of the clinical determinants of post-intubation oxygen 
      deficiency. Future research might also investigate potential benefits of more 
      advanced preprocessing approaches such as automated feature learning.

AB  - Anesthesia monitoring currently needs a reliable method to evaluate the effects 
      of the anesthetics on its primary target, the brain. This study focuses on 
      investigating the clinical usability of a functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
      (fNIRS)-derived machine learning classifier to perform automated and real-time 
      classification of maintenance and emergence states during sevoflurane anesthesia. 
      For 19 surgical procedures, we examine the entire continuum of the 
      maintenance-transition-emergence phases and evaluate the predictive capability of 
      a support vector machine (SVM) classifier during these phases. We demonstrate the 
      robustness of the predictions made by the SVM classifier and compare its 
      performance with that of minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and bispectral 
      (BIS) index-based predictions. The fNIRS-SVM investigated in this study provides 
      evidence to the usability of the fNIRS signal for anesthesia monitoring. The 
      method presented enables classification of the signal as maintenance or emergence 
      automatically as well as in real-time with high accuracy, sensitivity, and 
      specificity. The features local mean HbTotal, std [Formula: see text], local min 
      Hb and [Formula: see text], and range Hb and [Formula: see text] were found to be 
      robust biomarkers of this binary classification task. Furthermore, fNIRS-SVM was 
      capable of identifying emergence before movement in a larger number of patients 
      than BIS and MAC.

TI  - Neural Network Classifier for Automatic Detection of Invasive Versus Noninvasive 
      Airway Management Technique Based on Respiratory Monitoring Parameters in a 
      Pediatric Anesthesia.
PG  - 153
LID - 10.1007/s10916-017-0787-3 [doi]
AB  - Children undergoing general anesthesia require airway monitoring by an anesthesia 
      provider. The airway may be supported with noninvasive devices such as face mask 
      or invasive devices such as a laryngeal mask airway or an endotracheal tube. The 
      physiologic data stored provides an opportunity to apply machine learning 
      algorithms distinguish between these modes based on pattern recognition. We 
      retrieved three data sets from patients receiving general anesthesia in 2015 with 
      either mask, laryngeal mask airway or endotracheal tube. Patients underwent 
      myringotomy, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy or inguinal hernia repair procedures. 
      We retrieved measurements for end-tidal carbon dioxide, tidal volume, and peak 
      inspiratory pressure and calculated statistical features for each data element 
      per patient. We applied machine learning algorithms (decision tree, support 
      vector machine, and neural network) to classify patients into noninvasive or 
      invasive airway device support. We identified 300 patients per group (mask, 
      laryngeal mask airway, and endotracheal tube) for a total of 900 patients. The 
      neural network classifier performed better than the boosted trees and support 
      vector machine classifiers based on the test data sets. The sensitivity, 
      specificity, and accuracy for neural network classification are 97.5%, 96.3%, and 
      95.8%. In contrast, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of support vector 
      machine are 89.1%, 92.3%, and 88.3% and with the boosted tree classifier they are 
      93.8%, 92.1%, and 91.4%. We describe a method to automatically distinguish 
      between noninvasive and invasive airway device support in a pediatric surgical 
      setting based on respiratory monitoring parameters. The results show that the 
      neural network classifier algorithm can accurately classify noninvasive and 
      invasive airway device support.

TI  - Automatic Localization of the Needle Target for Ultrasound-Guided Epidural 
      Injections.
PG  - 81-92
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2017.2739110 [doi]
AB  - Accurate identification of the needle target is crucial for effective epidural 
      anesthesia. Currently, epidural needle placement is administered by a manual 
      technique, relying on the sense of feel, which has a significant failure rate. 
      Moreover, misleading the needle may lead to inadequate anesthesia, post dural 
      puncture headaches, and other potential complications. Ultrasound offers guidance 
      to the physician for identification of the needle target, but accurate 
      interpretation and localization remain challenges. A hybrid machine learning 
      system is proposed to automatically localize the needle target for epidural 
      needle placement in ultrasound images of the spine. In particular, a deep network 
      architecture along with a feature augmentation technique is proposed for 
      automatic identification of the anatomical landmarks of the epidural space in 
      ultrasound images. Experimental results of the target localization on planes of 
      3-D as well as 2-D images have been compared against an expert sonographer. When 
      compared with the expert annotations, the average lateral and vertical errors on 
      the planes of 3-D test data were 1 and 0.4 mm, respectively. On 2-D test data 
      set, an average lateral error of 1.7 mm and vertical error of 0.8 mm were 
      acquired.

TI  - Upper Respiratory Infections and Airway Adverse Events in Pediatric Procedural 
      Sedation.
LID - e20170009 [pii]
LID - 10.1542/peds.2017-0009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Upper respiratory infections (URIs) are associated with airway 
      adverse events (AAEs) during general anesthesia. There have been no large studies 
      examining the relationship between URIs and AAEs during pediatric procedural 
      sedation. We hypothesized that there would be a relationship between URI status 
      and AAEs in pediatric procedural sedation. METHODS: We examined prospectively 
      collected data from the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium database. Specific 
      questions regarding URI status were added to the database to facilitate our 
      analysis. Characteristics of patients, procedure types, adjunctive medications, 
      adverse events, and airway interventions (AIs) were reported. We performed 
      bivariate analysis of adverse events and URI status, then used a multivariable 
      logistic regression model to assess the relationship between URI status and 
      adverse events. We examined the secondary outcome of AI similarly. RESULTS: Of 
      the 105 728 sedations entered into the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium 
      database during the study period, we were able to use 83 491 for analysis. 
      Controlling for multiple patient, drug, and procedure characteristics, recent and 
      current URI were associated with increased frequency of AAEs. In general, the 
      frequency of AAEs and AIs increased from recent URI, to current URI-clear 
      secretions to current URI-thick secretions. We did not find a relationship 
      between URI status and non-AAEs. CONCLUSIONS: URI status is associated with a 
      statistically significant increase in frequency of AAEs and AI during pediatric 
      procedural sedation for the population sedated by our consortium. Although URI 
      status merits consideration in determining potential risk for sedation, rates of 
      some AAEs and AIs remained low regardless of URI status.

AB  - We assessed the effects of varying doses of remifentanil on respiratory drive and 
      timing in patients receiving Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) and Neurally 
      Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA). Four incrementing remifentanil doses were 
      randomly administered to thirteen intubated patients (0.03, 0.05, 0.08, and 
      0.1μg·Kg(-1)·min(-)1) during both PSV and NAVA. We measured the patient's 
      (Ti/Ttot(neu)) and ventilator (Ti/Ttot(mec)) duty cycle, the Electrical Activity 
      of the Diaphragm (EAdi), the inspiratory (Delay(trinsp)) and expiratory 
      (Delay(trexp)) trigger delays and the Asynchrony Index (AI). Increasing doses of 
      remifentanil did not modify EAdi, regardless the ventilatory mode. In comparison 
      to baseline, remifentanil infusion >0.05μg/Kg(-1)/min(-1) produced a significant 
      reduction of Ti/Ttot(neu) and Ti/Ttot(mec,) by prolonging the expiratory time. 
      Delay(trinsp) and Delay(trexp) were significantly shorter in NAVA, respect to 
      PSV. AI was not influenced by the different doses of remifentanil, but it was 
      significantly lower during NAVA, compared to PSV. In conclusion remifentanil did 
      not affect the respiratory drive, but only respiratory timing, without 
      differences between modes.

TI  - Patient-Specific Classification of ICU Sedation Levels From Heart Rate 
      Variability.
PG  - e683-e690
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000002364 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a personalizable algorithm to discriminate between sedation 
      levels in ICU patients based on heart rate variability. DESIGN: Multicenter, 
      pilot study. SETTING: Several ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. 
      PATIENTS: We gathered 21,912 hours of routine electrocardiogram recordings from a 
      heterogenous group of 70 adult ICU patients. All patients included in the study 
      were mechanically ventilated and were receiving sedatives. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: As "ground truth" for developing our method, we used Richmond Agitation 
      Sedation Scale scores grouped into four levels denoted "comatose" (-5), "deeply 
      sedated" (-4 to -3), "lightly sedated" (-2 to 0), and "agitated" (+1 to +4). We 
      trained a support vector machine learning algorithm to calculate the probability 
      of each sedation level from heart rate variability measures derived from the 
      electrocardiogram. To estimate algorithm performance, we calculated 
      leave-one-subject out cross-validated accuracy. The patient-independent version 
      of the proposed system discriminated between the four sedation levels with an 
      overall accuracy of 59%. Upon personalizing the system supplementing the training 
      data with patient-specific calibration data, consisting of an individual's 
      labeled heart rate variability epochs from the preceding 24 hours, accuracy 
      improved to 67%. The personalized system discriminated between light- and 
      deep-sedation states with an average accuracy of 75%. CONCLUSIONS: With further 
      refinement, the methodology reported herein could lead to a fully automated 
      system for depth of sedation monitoring. By enabling monitoring to be continuous, 
      such technology may help clinical staff to monitor sedation levels more 
      effectively and to reduce complications related to over- and under sedation.

TI  - Attenuation of Hemodynamic Response to Skull Pin Head Holder Insertion: 
      Intravenous Clonidine versus Intravenous Lignocaine Infusion.
PG  - 129-133
LID - 10.4103/0259-1162.186592 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insertion of skull pin induces a significant increase in heart rate 
      (HR), blood pressure (BP) and intracranial pressure. Alpha 2 agonist clonidine 
      and intravenous (i.v.) lignocaine are effective in attenuating stress response. 
      Local infiltration of pin site and scalp block with lignocaine are commonly used 
      techniques for prevention of hemodynamic response to skull pin insertion. We 
      compared the effectiveness of i.v. clonidine infusion and i.v. lignocaine 
      infusion in suppressing the hemodynamic response to skull pin head holder 
      insertion. DESIGNS: Randomized double blind study conducted with sample size - 
      sixty patients, divided into two groups: Group C (n = 30) - clonidine i.v. dose 2 
      μg/kg; Group L (n = 30) - lignocaine i.v. dose 1.5 mg/kg. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      All patients posted for elective craniotomy belonging to American Society of 
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) 1 and 2, age group 18-70 were included in the study. ASA 
      3, 4; difficult airway; hypertensives; allergy to study drugs; ischemic heart 
      disease; and arteriovenous malformations were excluded. Study drugs were 
      administered 10 min prior to induction in 10 ml syringes with infusion pump over 
      10 min. Standard anesthesia protocol followed. HR, noninvasive BP, mean arterial 
      pressure (MAP), and IBP were recorded at baseline (BL), after study drug (AD), 1 
      min after intubation (AI), 1 min prior to pin insertion -pre pin (PP), and 5 min 
      after pin insertion (AP). ANALYSIS: Descriptive and inferential statistical 
      analysis - Student's t- and Chi-square/Fisher exact test were used (SAS 9.2, SPSS 
      15.0) P value described as *moderately significant (P value: 0.01 < P ≤ 0.05) 
      **strongly significant (P value: P ≤ 0.01). RESULTS: Groups were matched with 
      respect to age (P = 0.7), gender distribution (P = 0.6), and weight (P = 0.67) 
      There was no difference in BL HR in two groups. Significant difference in HR was 
      noted after intubation P < 0.031 and pin insertion P < 0.001 stages with lower HR 
      in Group C (76.03 ± 9.88) versus Group L (98 ± 60.89) MAP recordings showed no 
      statistically significant difference in two groups at BL and after drug 
      administration stages. A significant difference was seen in intubation (P < 
      0.014), very significant difference (P < 0.001) was noted in pre- and post-pin 
      insertion stages with MAP was lower in Group C (76.03 ± 9.88) versus Group L 
      (87.17 ± 8.90). CONCLUSION: i.v. clonidine at dose of 2 μg/kg is a better drug in 
      attenuating hemodynamic response to skull pin head holder insertion than i.v. 
      lignocaine.

TI  - Deep neural network architectures for forecasting analgesic response.
PG  - 2966-2969
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591352 [doi]
AB  - Response to prescribed analgesic drugs varies between individuals, and choosing 
      the right drug/dose often involves a lengthy, iterative process of trial and 
      error. Furthermore, a significant portion of patients experience adverse events 
      such as post-operative urinary retention (POUR) during inpatient management of 
      acute postoperative pain. To better forecast analgesic responses, we compared 
      conventional machine learning methods with modern neural network architectures to 
      gauge their effectiveness at forecasting temporal patterns of postoperative pain 
      and analgesic use, as well as predicting the risk of POUR. Our results indicate 
      that simpler machine learning approaches might offer superior results; however, 
      all of these techniques may play a promising role for developing smarter 
      post-operative pain management strategies.

TI  - Investigation of optical neuro-monitoring technique for detection of maintenance 
      and emergence states during general anesthesia.

AB  - The American Society of Anesthesiologist recommends peripheral physiological 
      monitoring during general anesthesia, which offers no information regarding the 
      effects of anesthetics on the brain. Since no "gold standard" method exists for 
      this evaluation, such a technique is needed to ensure patient comfort, procedure 
      quality and safety. In this study we investigated functional near infrared 
      spectroscopy (fNIRS) as possible monitor of anesthetic effects on the prefrontal 
      cortex. Anesthetic drugs, such as sevoflurane, suppress the cerebral metabolism 
      and alter the cerebral blood flow. We hypothesize that fNIRS derived features 
      carry information on the effects of anesthetics on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
      that can be used for the classification of the anesthetized state. In this study, 
      patients were continuously monitored using fNIRS, BIS and standard monitoring 
      during surgical procedures under sevoflurane general anesthesia. Maintenance and 
      emergence states were identified and fNIRS features were identified and compared 
      between states. Linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms were 
      investigated as methods for the classification of maintenance/emergence. The 
      results show that changes in oxygenated (HbO(2)) and deoxygenated hemoglobin 
      (HHb) concentration and blood volume measured by fNIRS were associated with the 
      transition between maintenance and emergence that occurs as a result of 
      sevoflurane washout. We observed that during maintenance the signal is relatively 
      more stable than during emergence. Maintenance and emergence states were 
      classified with 94.7% accuracy with a non-linear model using the locally derived 
      mean total hemoglobin, standard deviation of HbO(2), minimum and range of HbO(2) 
      and HHb as features. These features were found to be correlated with the effects 
      of sevoflurane and to carry information that allows real time and automatic 
      classification of the anesthetized state with high accuracy.

PG  - 135-154
LID - 10.1007/s11938-017-0119-1 [doi]
AB  - The current review will attempt to describe the important lessons learned from 
      published randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing water immersion (WI) or 
      water exchange (WE) techniques with gas insufflation colonoscopy. Air 
      insufflation (AI) to distend the colon to permit visualization and passage 
      through the lumen was developed for diagnostic colonoscopy. When screening 
      colonoscopy was adopted, the same AI method was used. Interval cancers, diagnosed 
      within 3 to 5 years after an index screening colonoscopy, appeared to be linked 
      to low adenoma detection rate (ADR). Conscious sedation was introduced to manage 
      insertion pain a few decades ago, incurring moderate costs of nursing staff, 
      space for recovery, patient burdens of escort requirement, and at home recovery 
      time. Recent advancement to deep sedation entailed additional costs of anesthesia 
      staff support. In the past decade, investigators worldwide evaluated the use of 
      water-assisted methods as an adjunct or in lieu of gas insufflation during 
      insertion to minimize discomfort and improve ease of insertion. For convenience, 
      one approach embraced the removal of infused water during withdrawal (WI). A 
      subsequent evolution entailed removal of infused water predominantly during 
      insertion (WE), specifically designed to further minimize insertion pain. Results 
      of RCT shed light on the impact of WI and WE on insertion pain (primary outcome) 
      and adenoma detection (secondary outcome). Water immersion is easier to learn and 
      apply than WE, but mastery of the WE technique appears to have two major 
      advantages. Current RCT data suggest that both WI and WE decrease insertion pain 
      and facilitate completion of difficult colonoscopy, with WE having a superior 
      impact than WI. Water exchange was serendipitously associated with an increase in 
      ADR; this has been repeatedly confirmed in follow-up studies. When it is unknown 
      which patient's colonoscopy will be difficult, it would seem prudent for the 
      average colonoscopist to optimize the chance of success and increase in ADR by 
      using WE from the very start.

TI  - Experience-dependent modulation of right anterior insula and sensorimotor regions 
      as a function of noise-masked auditory feedback in singers and nonsingers.

AB  - Previous studies on vocal motor production in singing suggest that the right 
      anterior insula (AI) plays a role in experience-dependent modulation of feedback 
      integration. Specifically, when somatosensory input was reduced via anesthesia of 
      the vocal fold mucosa, right AI activity was down regulated in trained singers. 
      In the current fMRI study, we examined how masking of auditory feedback affects 
      pitch-matching accuracy and corresponding brain activity in the same 
      participants. We found that pitch-matching accuracy was unaffected by masking in 
      trained singers yet declined in nonsingers. The corresponding brain region with 
      the most differential and interesting activation pattern was the right AI, which 
      was up regulated during masking in singers but down regulated in nonsingers. 
      Likewise, its functional connectivity with inferior parietal, frontal, and 
      voice-relevant sensorimotor areas was increased in singers yet decreased in 
      nonsingers. These results indicate that singers relied more on somatosensory 
      feedback, whereas nonsingers depended more critically on auditory feedback. When 
      comparing auditory vs somatosensory feedback involvement, the right anterior 
      insula emerged as the only region for correcting intended vocal output by 
      modulating what is heard or felt as a function of singing experience. We propose 
      the right anterior insula as a key node in the brain's singing network for the 
      integration of signals of salience across multiple sensory and cognitive domains 
      to guide vocal behavior.

      undergoing complex cardiac surgery with CPB and its association with 
      intraoperative post-CPB outcomes. METHODS: Forty subjects enrolled in a prior 
      randomized control trial who received preoperative methylprednisolone as part of 
      our institutional neonatal bypass protocol were included. No intraoperative 
      steroids were given. ACTH stimulation tests were performed: preoperatively and 1 
      h after separation from CPB. AI was defined as <9 μg·ml(-1) increase in cortisol 
      at 30 min post cosyntropin 1 mcg. Clinical outcomes were collected up to 90 min 
      after CPB. RESULTS: 2/40 (5%) subjects had preoperative AI vs 13/40 (32.5%) 
      post-CPB AI, P ≤ 0.001. No significant difference was observed in age, 
      gestational age, weight, CPB time, circulatory arrest, or STAT category between 
      subjects with or without post-CPB AI. ACTH decreased from preoperative values 
      127.3 vs 35 pcg·ml(-1) [median difference = 81.8, 95% CI = 22.7-127.3], while 
      cortisol increased from 18.9 vs 75 μg·dl(-1) [median difference = 52.2, 95% CI = 
      36.3-70.9]. Post-CPB AI was associated with increased median colloid 
      resuscitation, 275 vs 119 ml·kg(-1) [median difference = 97.8, 95% CI = 
      7.1-202.2]; higher median peak lactate, 9.4 vs 6.9 mg·dl(-1) [median difference = 
      3.2, 95% CI = 0.04-6.7]; median post-CPB lactate, 7.9 vs 4.3 mg·dl(-1) , [median 
      difference 3.6, 95% CI = 2.1-4.7], and median lactate on admission to CICU, 9.4 
      vs 6.0 mg·dl(-1) [median difference = 3, 95% CI = 1.1-4.9]. No difference was 
      observed in blood pressure or vasoactive inotrope score at any time point 
      measured in operating room (OR). Higher initial post-CPB cortisol correlated with 
      decreased cosyntropin response. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal cardiac surgery with CPB 
      and preoperative methylprednisolone leads to AI as determined by low-dose ACTH 
      stimulation test in one-third of patients. AI is associated with increased serum 
      lactate and colloid resuscitation in OR. Impact of preoperative 
      methylprednisolone on results is not defined. Benefit of postoperative steroid 
      administration in neonates with post-CPB AI warrants further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The biologic basis for intelligence rests to a large 
      degree on the capacity for efficient integration of information across the 
      cerebral network. We aimed to measure the relationship between network 
      architecture and intelligence in the pediatric, epileptic brain. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Patients were retrospectively identified with the following: 1) focal 
      epilepsy; 2) brain MR imaging at 3T, including resting-state functional MR 
      imaging; and 3) full-scale intelligence quotient measured by a pediatric 
      neuropsychologist. The cerebral cortex was parcellated into approximately 700 
      gray matter network "nodes." The strength of a connection between 2 nodes was 
      defined by the correlation between their blood oxygen level-dependent 
      time-series. We calculated the following topologic properties: clustering 
      coefficient, transitivity, modularity, path length, and global efficiency. A 
      machine learning algorithm was used to measure the independent contribution of 
      each metric to the intelligence quotient after adjusting for all other metrics. 
      RESULTS: Thirty patients met the criteria (4-18 years of age); 20 patients 
      required anesthesia during MR imaging. After we accounted for age and sex, 
      clustering coefficient and path length were independently associated with 
      full-scale intelligence quotient. Neither motion parameters nor general 
      anesthesia was an important variable with regard to accurate intelligence 
      quotient prediction by the machine learning algorithm. A longer history of 
      epilepsy was associated with shorter path lengths (P = .008), consistent with 
      reorganization of the network on the basis of seizures. Considering only patients 
      receiving anesthesia during machine learning did not alter the patterns of 
      network architecture contributing to global intelligence. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings support the physiologic relevance of imaging-based metrics of network 
      architecture in the pathologic, developing brain.

      Rat Auditory Cortex.

AB  - Cortical information processing of the onset, offset, and continuous plateau of 
      an acoustic stimulus should play an important role in acoustic object perception. 
      To date, transient activities responding to the onset and offset of a sound have 
      been well investigated and cortical subfields and topographic representation in 
      these subfields, such as place code of sound frequency, have been well 
      characterized. However, whether these cortical subfields with tonotopic 
      representation are inherited in the sustained activities that follow transient 
      activities and persist during the presentation of a long-lasting stimulus remains 
      unknown, because sustained activities do not exhibit distinct, reproducible, and 
      time-locked responses in their amplitude to be characterized by grand averaging. 
      To address this gap in understanding, we attempted to decode sound information 
      from densely mapped sustained activities in the rat auditory cortex using a 
      sparse parameter estimation method called sparse logistic regression (SLR), and 
      investigated whether and how these activities represent sound information. A 
      microelectrode array with a grid of 10 × 10 recording sites within an area of 4.0 
      mm × 4.0 mm was implanted in the fourth layer of the auditory cortex in rats 
      under isoflurane anesthesia. Sustained activities in response to long-lasting 
      constant pure tones were recorded. SLR then was applied to discriminate the 
      sound-induced band-specific power or phase-locking value from those of 
      spontaneous activities. The highest decoding performance was achieved in the 
      high-gamma band, indicating that cortical inhibitory interneurons may contribute 
      to the sparse tonotopic representation in sustained activities by mediating 
      synchronous activities. The estimated parameter in the SLR decoding revealed that 
      the informative recording site had a characteristic frequency close to the test 
      frequency. In addition, decoding of the four test frequencies demonstrated that 
      the decoding performance of the SLR deteriorated when the test frequencies were 
      close, supporting the hypothesis that the sustained activities were organized in 
      a tonotopic manner. Finally, unlike transient activities, sustained activities 
      were more informative in the belt than in the core region, indicating that 
      higher-order auditory areas predominate over lower-order areas during sustained 
      activities. Taken together, our results indicate that the auditory cortex 
      processes sound information tonotopically and in a hierarchical manner.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Accessory innervation (AI) may account for the persistent sensation 
      perceived after successful mandibular anesthesia in the adult patient. The 
      purpose of this systematic review was to record the quality of evidence 
      pertaining to the cervical plexus (CP) AI in dental anesthesia. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Electronic and manual searches were conducted using Ovid and Medline of 
      articles published from 1922 to March of 2015. Studies written in any language 
      were included as long as they involved: (i) humans, animals, and/or cadavers AND 
      (ii) anatomical and/or research anesthetic-technique approaches and/or clinical 
      approaches. Exclusion criteria were (i) maxillary buccal infiltration, (ii) no 
      abstract/paper available, (iii) studies that do not comprise the description of 
      the branches of the CP branches in dentistry and (iv) duplicated articles. The 
      articles were reviewed and graded by levels of evidence (LOE) through a 
      methodological scoring index (MSI). RESULTS: Forty-four out of 185 papers 
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One randomized control trial, 3 comprehensive 
      reviews, 1 cohort study, 5 case series/reports, 16 poor-quality cohort and case 
      series/reports and 18 reviews/case, reports/expert opinions were found. Of the 44 
      publications, there were 4 LOE 1, 1 LOE 2, 5 LOE 3, 20 LOE 4 and 14 LOE 5 
      studies. CONCLUSIONS: The MSI helped to classify papers LOE in a standardized and 
      objective approach. The objective evidence quality occurrence recorded was found 
      to be LOE 4 (n = 20) > LOE 5 (n = 14) > LOE 3 (n = 5) > LOE 1 (n = 4) > LOE 2 (n 
      = 1). The anatomy of the CP needs to be reexamined and understood in the 
      anatomical literature.

TI  - Moderate Aortic Valvular Insufficiency Invalidates Vortex Formation Time as an 
      Index of Left Ventricular Filling Efficiency in Patients With Severe Degenerative 
      Calcific Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Aortic Valve Replacement.
PG  - 1260-5

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transmitral blood flow produces a vortex ring (quantified using vortex 
      formation time [VFT]) that enhances the efficiency of left ventricular (LV) 
      filling. VFT is attenuated in LV hypertrophy resulting from aortic valve stenosis 
      (AS) versus normal LV geometry. Many patients with AS also have aortic 
      insufficiency (AI). The authors tested the hypothesis that moderate AI falsely 
      elevates VFT by partially inhibiting mitral leaflet opening in patients with AS. 
      DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Veterans Affairs medical center. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Patients with AS in the presence or absence of moderate AI (n = 8 
      per group) undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) were studied after 
      institutional review board approval. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: Under general anesthesia, peak early LV filling (E) and atrial systole 
      (A) blood flow velocities and their corresponding velocity-time integrals were 
      obtained using pulse-wave Doppler transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to 
      determine E/A and atrial filling fraction (beta). Mitral valve diameter (D) was 
      calculated as the average of major and minor axis lengths obtained in the 
      midesophageal bicommissural (transcommissural anterior-lateral-posterior medial) 
      and LV long-axis (anterior-posterior) TEE imaging planes, respectively. VFT was 
      calculated as 4·(1-beta)·SV/πD(3), where SV = stroke volume measured using 
      thermodilution. Hemodynamics, diastolic function, and VFT were determined during 
      steady-state conditions before cardiopulmonary bypass. The severity of AS (mean 
      and peak pressure gradients, peak transvalvular jet velocity, aortic valve area) 
      and diastolic function (E/A, beta) were similar between groups. Moderate 
      centrally directed AI was present in 8 patients with AS (ratio of regurgitant jet 
      width to LV outflow tract diameter of 36±6%). Pulse pressure and mean pulmonary 
      artery pressure were elevated in patients with versus without AI, but no other 
      differences in hemodynamics were observed. Mitral valve minor and major axis 
      lengths, diameter, and area were reduced in the presence versus the absence of 
      AI. VFT was increased significantly (5.7±1.7 v 3.2±0.6; p = 0.00108) in patients 
      with AS and AI compared with AS alone. CONCLUSION: Moderate AI falsely elevates 
      VFT in patients with severe AS undergoing AVR by partially inhibiting mitral 
      valve opening. VFT may be an unreliable index of LV filling efficiency with 
      competitive diastolic flow into the LV.

AB  - The objective of this study was to design an artificial insemination (AI) 
      protocol using cryopreserved spermatozoa to obtain pregnancies in captive Indian 
      rhinoceroses (Rhinoceros unicornis). Four methods developed varied by timing and 
      approach, as follows; Method 1: females (n=2) were inseminated pre- and 
      post-ovulation under general anesthesia, Method 2: females (n=2) were inseminated 
      pre-ovulation without anesthetic via endoscopy, Method 3: females (n=1) were 
      inseminated pre-ovulation without anesthetic via manual insertion of an 
      insemination catheter, Method 4: females (n=2) were inseminated same as Method 3 
      with the addition of standing sedation. Semen deposition site varied as a result 
      of changes in AI technology and experience. All females conceived following 
      intrauterine AI using three methods. Four pregnancies (n=3 females) produced via 
      Method 3 and 4 resulted in term births (n=2 male calves, n=2 female calves) at 
      481.8±12.8days post-AI. Unfortunately, two early pregnancy losses were documented 
      in a fourth female conceiving via Method 2. Pregnancy rates were 0%, 22%, 17%, 
      and 50% for Method 1-4, respectively. Method 3 and 4 rates improved to 29% and 
      67%, respectively when accounting for AI's conducted only on ovulatory estrous 
      cycles. Spermatozoa (n=5 males) were cryopreserved 0.3-9.3 y prior to successful 
      AI procedures. The lowest dose of frozen-thawed sperm resulting in conception was 
      500×10(6) motile sperm. Mean time from AI to ovulation in conceptive and 
      non-conceptive cycles was 26±11.8h and 66±80.7h, respectively.

TI  - Integration of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapies into Primary-Care 
      Pain Management for Opiate Reduction in a Rural Setting.
PG  - 621-6
LID - 10.1089/acm.2015.0212 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opiates are no longer considered the best strategy for the long-term 
      management of chronic pain. Yet, physicians have made many patients dependent on 
      them, and these patients still request treatment. Complementary and alternative 
      medicine (CAM) therapies have been shown to be effective, but are not widely 
      available and are not often covered by insurance or available to the medically 
      underserved. METHODS: Group medical visits (GMVs) provided education about 
      non-pharmacological methods for pain management and taught mindfulness 
      techniques, movement, guided imagery, relaxation training, yoga, qigong, and t'ai 
      chi. Forty-two patients attending GMVs for at least six months were matched 
      prospectively with patients receiving conventional care. RESULTS: No one 
      increased their dose of opiates. Seventeen people reduced their dose, and seven 
      people stopped opiates. On a 10-point scale of pain intensity, reductions in pain 
      ratings achieved statistical significance (p = 0.001). The average reduction was 
      0.19 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-0.60; p = 0.01). The primary symptom 
      improved on average by -0.42 (95% CI -0.31 to -0.93; p = 0.02) on the My Medical 
      Outcome Profile, 2nd version. Improvement in the quality-of-life rating was 
      statistically significant (p = 0.007) with a change of -1.42 (95% CI = -0.59 to 
      -1.62). In conventional care, no patients reduced their opiate use, and 48.5% 
      increased their dose over the two years of the project. CONCLUSIONS: GMVs that 
      incorporated CAM therapies helped patients reduce opiate use. While some patients 
      found other physicians to give them the opiates they desired, those who persisted 
      in an environment of respect and acceptance significantly reduced opiate 
      consumption compared with patients in conventional care. While resistant to CAM 
      therapies initially, the majority of patients came to accept and to appreciate 
      their usefulness. GMVs were useful for incorporating non-reimbursed CAM therapies 
      into primary medical care.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The principal challenges in the field of anesthesia and 
      intensive care consist of reducing both anesthetic risks and mortality rate. The 
      ASA score plays an important role in patients' preanesthetic evaluation. In this 
      paper, we propose a methodology to derive simple rules which classify patients in 
      a category of the ASA scale on the basis of their medical characteristics. 
      METHODS: This diagnosis system is based on MR-Sort, a multiple criteria decision 
      analysis model. The proposed method intends to support two steps in this process. 
      The first is the assignment of an ASA score to the patient; the second concerns 
      the decision to accept-or not-the patient for surgery. RESULTS: In order to learn 
      the model parameters and assess its effectiveness, we use a database containing 
      the parameters of 898 patients who underwent preanesthesia evaluation. The 
      accuracy of the learned models for predicting the ASA score and the decision of 
      accepting the patient for surgery is assessed and proves to be better than that 
      of other machine learning methods. Furthermore, simple decision rules can be 
      explicitly derived from the learned model. These are easily interpretable by 
      doctors, and their consistency with medical knowledge can be checked. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model for assessing the ASA score produces accurate 
      predictions on the basis of the (limited) set of patient attributes in the 
      database available for the tests. Moreover, the learned MR-Sort model allows for 
      easy interpretation by providing human-readable classification rules.

TI  - The Effect of Regional Analgesia on Vascular Tone in Hip Arthroplasty Patients.
PG  - 125-31
LID - 10.1007/s11420-015-9477-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While it is assumed that neuraxial analgesia and pain management may 
      beneficially influence perioperative hemodynamics, few studies provided data 
      quantifying such effects and none have assessed the potential contribution of the 
      addition of a nerve block. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: This clinical trial compared the 
      visual analog scale (VAS) scores and measurement of arterial tone using 
      augmentation index of patients who received combined spinal-epidural (CSE) only 
      to patients who received both CSE and lumbar plexus block. METHODS: After 
      obtaining written consent, 92 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty were 
      randomized to receive either CSE or CSE with lumbar plexus block (LPB). 
      Perioperative pain and arterial tone were measured using VAS scores and 
      augmentation index (AI) respectively, at baseline and at various times 
      postoperatively. RESULTS: After the exclusion of 2 patients, 44 patients received 
      CSE alone and 46 patients received CSE and LPB. Patient demographics and 
      perioperative characteristics were similar in both groups. AI continuously 
      decreased after placement of a CSE with or without LBP, beyond full resolution of 
      neuraxial and peripheral blockade. Although the LPB group demonstrated a 
      statistically significant reduction of VAS pain scores in the postanesthesia care 
      unit (PACU; P < 0.05), overall, the addition of a LPB did not significantly 
      reduce the AI when compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The addition of a 
      LPB provided better pain control in the PACU but did not reduce the AI, compared 
      to the control group. We conclude that the addition of a LPB may have limited 
      ability to affect arterial tone in the presence of a continuous infusion of 
      epidural analgesics. In summary, the addition of a LPB in patients undergoing 
      total hip arthroplasty is clinically effective and provided better pain control, 
      especially in the immediate postoperative period. The continuous decrease on the 
      AI in both groups beyond the full resolution of the neuroaxial and LPB will 
      require further studies.

TI  - Effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol on patient-ventilator interaction in 
      difficult-to-wean, mechanically ventilated patients: a prospective, open-label, 
      randomised, multicentre study.
PG  - 206

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine can be used for sedation of mechanically ventilated 
      patients and has minor respiratory effects. The aim of this study was to compare 
      the incidence of patient-ventilator dyssynchronies during sedation with 
      dexmedetomidine or propofol. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, prospective, 
      open-label, randomised clinical trial, comparing dexmedetomidine with standard 
      propofol sedation at three intensive care units of university hospitals in Italy. 
      Twenty difficult-to-wean patients for whom the first weaning trial had failed and 
      who were on pressure support ventilation were randomised to receive sedation with 
      either dexmedetomidine or propofol at a similar level of sedation (Richmond 
      Agitation-Sedation Scale [RASS] score +1 to -2). The asynchrony index (AI) was 
      calculated using tracings of airflow, airway pressure and electrical activity of 
      the diaphragm sampled at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h. RESULTS: The mean AI 
      was lower with dexmedetomidine than with propofol from 2 h onwards, although the 
      two groups significantly differed only at 12 h (2.68 % vs 9.10 %, p < 0.05). No 
      further difference was observed at 18 and 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: When sedation with 
      propofol and dexmedetomidine was compared at similar RASS scores of patients in 
      whom first weaning trial had failed, the AI was lower with dexmedetomidine than 
      with propofol, and this difference was statistically significant at 12 h. These 
      results suggest that sedation with dexmedetomidine may offer some advantages in 
      terms of patient-ventilator synchrony.

TI  - Interventions for the Treatment of Aromatase Inhibitor-Associated Arthralgia in 
      Breast Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - E26-E41
LID - 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been established as successful 
      adjuvant therapy for breast cancer survivors. Unfortunately, nearly half of women 
      taking AIs report joint pain, AI-associated arthralgia (AIA). Aromatase 
      inhibitor-associated arthralgia often results in noncompliance, which could lead 
      to cancer recurrence. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify 
      current pain management of AIA and to evaluate the study quality and effects of 
      interventions. METHODS: Nineteen articles published from 2000 to August 2015 were 
      identified using PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and additional 
      records. Study quality was evaluated by the Quality Assessment Tool for 
      Quantitative Studies. Meta-analysis was used to obtain effect sizes of 
      interventions on pain and subgroups. RESULTS: Five types of interventions 
      emerged: pharmacological approaches, acupuncture, nutritional supplementation, 
      relaxation techniques, and physical exercise. Six studies were strong, 8 were 
      moderate, and 5 were weak in quality. The overall effect size of the 
      interventions on pain was large; pharmacological approaches, acupuncture, and 
      relaxation techniques showed moderate to large effects on pain, whereas 
      nutritional supplementation and physical exercise had no significant effects on 
      it. CONCLUSION: The evidence was based on a body of research with moderate study 
      quality. Although the overall effect of interventions is large, further 
      investigation into the influence of nutrition and physical exercise is needed to 
      better discern their potential for pain management. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: 
      Oncology nurses may be able to implement such validated interventions as pain 
      management modalities to mitigate the symptoms so that breast cancer survivors 
      remain compliant with AIA therapy.

TI  - Impact of carbon dioxide insufflation and water exchange on postcolonoscopy 
      outcomes in patients receiving on-demand sedation: a randomized controlled trial.

LID - S0016-5107(16)30167-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.gie.2016.05.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Water exchange (WE) is the least painful insertion method 
      during colonoscopy. Its impact on postcolonoscopy discomfort has not been 
      well-described. Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) insufflation consistently reduced 
      postcolonoscopy discomfort. We compared postcolonoscopy outcomes of various 
      combinations of insertion and withdrawal techniques (insertion-withdrawal 
      modality): WE-CO(2), WE-air insufflation (WE-AI), and CO(2)-CO(2). METHODS: A 
      total of 240 patients undergoing on-demand sedation diagnostic colonoscopy were 
      randomized to WE-CO(2) (n = 79), WE-AI (n = 80), CO(2)-CO(2) (n = 81), with 
      postprocedural data collected up to 24 hours. The primary outcome was 
      postcolonoscopy bloating. Other postcolonoscopy outcomes included pain scores, 
      flatus and incontinence episodes, toilet use, interference with normal 
      activities, patient satisfaction, and patient willingness to repeat the 
      procedure. RESULTS: Demographic and procedural data were comparable. Compared 
      with WE-AI, WE-CO(2) and CO(2)-CO(2) resulted in significantly less bloating (all 
      P < .0005) and lower pain scores (P values ranged from .008 to < .0005) up to 3 
      hours and fewer flatus episodes up to 6 hours (P values ranged from .003 to < 
      .0005). WE-CO(2) resulted in less interference with same-day activities compared 
      with WE-AI (P = .043). The differences in postprocedural outcomes were 
      significant, but the magnitude was small. Patient satisfaction and willingness to 
      repeat the procedure were high and comparable among groups. WE was the least 
      painful insertion technique (P < .0005). CONCLUSIONS: The combination WE-CO(2) 
      appears to be the optimal choice to decrease pain during the examination and to 
      reduce bloating and other undesired procedural outcomes afterward. If a CO(2) 
      insufflator is already available, it seems advisable to adopt the combination 
      WE-CO(2). In the absence of a CO(2) insufflator, the cost effectiveness of the 
      addition of withdrawal CO(2) to WE in diagnostic and nondiagnostic settings needs 
      to be critically assessed. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT02409979.).

TI  - Adaptive fuzzy modeling of the hypnotic process in anesthesia.
PG  - 319-330
LID - 10.1007/s10877-016-9868-y [doi]
AB  - This paper addresses the problem of patient model synthesis in anesthesia. Recent 
      advanced drug infusion mechanisms use a patient model to establish the proper 
      drug dose. However, due to the inherent complexity and variability of the patient 
      dynamics, difficulty obtaining a good model is high. In this paper, a method 
      based on fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms is proposed as an alternative to 
      standard compartmental models. The model uses a Mamdani type fuzzy inference 
      system developed in a two-step procedure. First, an offline model is obtained 
      using information from real patients. Then, an adaptive strategy that uses 
      genetic algorithms is implemented. The validation of the modeling technique was 
      done using real data obtained from real patients in the operating room. Results 
      show that the proposed method based on artificial intelligence appears to be an 
      improved alternative to existing compartmental methodologies.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial comparing water exchange and air insufflation 
      during colonoscopy without sedation.
PG  - 1217-23
LID - 10.1007/s00384-016-2580-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have shown that water exchange is superior to air 
      insufflation in attenuating insertion pain during colonoscopy. We conducted a 
      randomized controlled trial with head-to-head comparison of these methods to 
      assess their effectiveness in colonoscopy without sedation. METHODS: A total of 
      447 outpatients were randomized to either water exchange (WE) or the standard air 
      (CO2) insufflation (AI). The primary outcome was the improvement of patient 
      intraprocedural pain (pain score), evaluated using a questionnaire (scores 1 to 
      5). RESULTS: After exclusion of 44 patients from further analysis, 403 patients 
      were analyzed. There was no difference in clinical background between the WE and 
      AI groups. Patients in the WE group reported less intraprocedural pain than those 
      in the AI group (2.17 ± 1.06 vs. 2.42 ± 1.03; unpaired t test, p = 0.021). We 
      divided the cases into two groups, more or less painful colonoscopy, based on 
      age, body mass index, use of anti-peristaltic drugs or not, and physician's 
      experience. In less painful colonoscopy, the WE method could reduce pain 
      effectively but its effect was limited in the more painful group. CONCLUSION: WE 
      is superior to AI for attenuating insertion pain during colonoscopy without 
      sedation, but its efficacy is limited in more painful endoscopy.

TI  - Patient-Centered Pain Care Using Artificial Intelligence and Mobile Health Tools: 
      Protocol for a Randomized Study Funded by the US Department of Veterans Affairs 
      Health Services Research and Development Program.
PG  - e53

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective 
      treatments for chronic low back pain. However, only half of Department of 
      Veterans Affairs (VA) patients have access to trained CBT therapists, and program 
      expansion is costly. CBT typically consists of 10 weekly hour-long sessions. 
      However, some patients improve after the first few sessions while others need 
      more extensive contact. OBJECTIVE: We are applying principles from "reinforcement 
      learning" (a field of artificial intelligence or AI) to develop an 
      evidence-based, personalized CBT pain management service that automatically 
      adapts to each patient's unique and changing needs (AI-CBT). AI-CBT uses feedback 
      from patients about their progress in pain-related functioning measured daily via 
      pedometer step counts to automatically personalize the intensity and type of 
      patient support. The specific aims of the study are to (1) demonstrate that 
      AI-CBT has pain-related outcomes equivalent to standard telephone CBT, (2) 
      document that AI-CBT achieves these outcomes with more efficient use of clinician 
      resources, and (3) demonstrate the intervention's impact on proximal outcomes 
      associated with treatment response, including program engagement, pain management 
      skill acquisition, and patients' likelihood of dropout. METHODS: In total, 320 
      patients with chronic low back pain will be recruited from 2 VA healthcare 
      systems and randomized to a standard 10 sessions of telephone CBT versus AI-CBT. 
      All patients will begin with weekly hour-long telephone counseling, but for 
      patients in the AI-CBT group, those who demonstrate a significant treatment 
      response will be stepped down through less resource-intensive alternatives 
      including: (1) 15-minute contacts with a therapist, and (2) CBT clinician 
      feedback provided via interactive voice response calls (IVR). The AI engine will 
      learn what works best in terms of patients' personally tailored treatment plans 
      based on daily feedback via IVR about their pedometer-measured step counts, CBT 
      skill practice, and physical functioning. Outcomes will be measured at 3 and 6 
      months post recruitment and will include pain-related interference, treatment 
      satisfaction, and treatment dropout. Our primary hypothesis is that AI-CBT will 
      result in pain-related functional outcomes that are at least as good as the 
      standard approach, and that by scaling back the intensity of contact that is not 
      associated with additional gains in pain control, the AI-CBT approach will be 
      significantly less costly in terms of therapy time. RESULTS: The trial is 
      currently in the start-up phase. Patient enrollment will begin in the fall of 
      2016 and results of the trial will be available in the winter of 2019. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study will evaluate an intervention that increases patients' 
      access to effective CBT pain management services while allowing health systems to 
      maximize program expansion given constrained resources.

TI  - Knowledge About Sounds-Context-Specific Meaning Differently Activates Cortical 
      Hemispheres, Auditory Cortical Fields, and Layers in House Mice.
PG  - 98
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2016.00098 [doi]
LID - 98
AB  - Activation of the auditory cortex (AC) by a given sound pattern is plastic, 
      depending, in largely unknown ways, on the physiological state and the behavioral 
      context of the receiving animal and on the receiver's experience with the sounds. 
      Such plasticity can be inferred when house mouse mothers respond maternally to 
      pup ultrasounds right after parturition and naïve females have to learn to 
      respond. Here we use c-FOS immunocytochemistry to quantify highly activated 
      neurons in the AC fields and layers of seven groups of mothers and naïve females 
      who have different knowledge about and are differently motivated to respond to 
      acoustic models of pup ultrasounds of different behavioral significance. Profiles 
      of FOS-positive cells in the AC primary fields (AI, AAF), the ultrasonic field 
      (UF), the secondary field (AII), and the dorsoposterior field (DP) suggest that 
      activation reflects in AI, AAF, and UF the integration of sound properties with 
      animal state-dependent factors, in the higher-order field AII the news value of a 
      given sound in the behavioral context, and in the higher-order field DP the level 
      of maternal motivation and, by left-hemisphere activation advantage, the 
      recognition of the meaning of sounds in the given context. Anesthesia reduced 
      activation in all fields, especially in cortical layers 2/3. Thus, plasticity in 
      the AC is field-specific preparing different output of AC fields in the process 
      of perception, recognition and responding to communication sounds. Further, the 
      activation profiles of the auditory cortical fields suggest the differentiation 
      between brains hormonally primed to know (mothers) and brains which acquired 
      knowledge via implicit learning (naïve females). In this way, auditory cortical 
      activation discriminates between instinctive (mothers) and learned (naïve 
      females) cognition.

TI  - Assessment of the effect of continuous sedation with mechanical ventilation on 
      adrenal insufficiency in patients with traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 752-8
LID - 10.1136/jim-2015-000012 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of continuous propofol sedation 
      plus prolonged mechanical ventilation on adrenal insufficiency (AI) in patients 
      with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Eighty-five adult patients diagnosed with 
      moderate TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 9-13) from October 2011 to October 
      2012 were included in this prospective study. The patients comprised three 
      groups: no mechanical ventilation and sedation (n=27), mechanical ventilation 
      alone (n=24) and mechanical ventilation plus sedation (n=34). The low-dose short 
      Synacthen test was performed at 8:00 on the first, third, and fifth days after 
      TBI. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors affecting the 
      use of mechanical ventilation and sedation, and the incidence of AI. On the fifth 
      day after injury, the mean baseline cortisol and simulated cortisol levels were 
      significantly lower in the mechanical ventilation plus sedation group compared 
      with the other two groups. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the Acute 
      Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score was independently 
      associated with treatment with mechanical ventilation and sedation compared to 
      mechanical ventilation alone. Furthermore, hypoxemia on admission and shock were 
      associated with the development of AI. The findings showed that sedation is 
      associated with an increased incidence of AI. Patients with TBI who are treated 
      with continuous sedation should be monitored for AI carefully.

TI  - Efficacy of Maxillomandibular Advancement Examined with Drug-Induced Sleep 
      Endoscopy and Computational Fluid Dynamics Airflow Modeling.
PG  - 189-95
LID - 10.1177/0194599815611603 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To use drug-induced sedation endoscopy (DISE) and computational fluid 
      dynamics (CFD) modeling to study dynamic airway and airflow changes after 
      maxillomandibular advancement (MMA), and how the changes correlate with surgical 
      success based on polysomnography parameters. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort 
      study. SETTING: University medical center. METHODS: DISE was rated with the VOTE 
      (velum, oropharynx, tongue, epiglottis) classification, and CFD was used to model 
      airflow velocity and negative pressure exerted on pharyngeal wall. Changes in 
      VOTE score by site and CFD measurements were correlated with perioperative 
      polysomnography outcomes of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), apnea index (AI), 
      oxygenation desaturation index (ODI), and lowest oxygen saturation. RESULTS: 
      After MMA, 20 subjects (17 males, 3 females) with a mean age of 44 ± 12 years and 
      body mass index of 27.4 ± 4.6 kg/m(2) showed mean decreases in AHI (53.6 ± 26.6 
      to 9.5 ± 7.4 events/h) and ODI (38.7 ± 30.3 to 8.1 ± 9.2 events/h; P < .001). 
      Improvement in lateral pharyngeal wall collapse during DISE based on VOTE score 
      correlated with the most decrease in AHI (60.0 ± 25.6 to 7.5 ± 3.4 events/h) and 
      ODI (46.7 ± 29.8 to 5.3 ± 2 events/h; P = .002). CFD modeling showed significant 
      positive Pearson correlations between reduction of retropalatal airflow velocity 
      and AHI (r = 0.617, P = .04) and ODI (r = 0.773, P = .005). CONCLUSION: AHI and 
      ODI improvement after MMA is best correlated with (1) decreased retropalatal 
      airflow velocity modeled by CFD and (2) increased lateral pharyngeal wall 
      stability based on VOTE scoring from DISE.

TI  - Automatic segmentation of nerve structures in ultrasound images using Graph Cuts 
      and Gaussian processes.
PG  - 3089-92
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319045 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral Nerve Blocking (PNB), is a procedure used for performing regional 
      anesthesia, that comprises the administration of anesthetic in the proximity of a 
      nerve. Several techniques have been used with the purpose of locating nerve 
      structures when the PNB procedure is performed: anatomical surface landmarks, 
      elicitation of paresthesia, nerve stimulation and ultrasound imaging. Among 
      those, ultrasound imaging has gained great attention because it is not invasive 
      and offers an accurate location of the nerve and the structures around it. 
      However, the segmentation of nerve structures in ultrasound images is a difficult 
      task for the specialist, since such images are affected by echo perturbations and 
      speckle noise. The development of systems for the automatic segmentation of nerve 
      structures can aid the specialist for locating nerve structures accurately. In 
      this paper we present a methodology for the automatic segmentation of nerve 
      structures in ultrasound images. An initial step is carried out using Graph Cut 
      segmentation in order to generate regions of interest; we then use machine 
      learning techniques with the aim of segmenting the nerve structure; here, a 
      specific non-linear Wavelet transform is used for the feature extraction stage, 
      and Gaussian processes for the classification step. The methodology performance 
      is measured in terms of accuracy and the dice coefficient. Results show that the 
      implemented methodology can be used for automatically segmenting nerve 
      structures.

TI  - Acupuncture for Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Arthralgia: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 496-502
LID - 10.1177/1534735415596573 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are commonly used as adjunctive hormone 
      treatment for early breast cancer patients. The major side effect of AIs is 
      arthralgia, which affects adherence. Previous reviews suggested that acupuncture 
      is effective in the management of cancer-related pain. The aim of this review is 
      to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on arthralgia caused by AIs. METHODS: This 
      article examined randomized controlled trials (RCTs) measuring the effects of 
      acupuncture on joint symptoms caused by AIs within 8 medical databases till May 
      2014. The quality of the articles was evaluated according to the Cochrane risk of 
      bias (ROB) tool. RESULTS: Four RCTs were identified in medical journals. Two 
      studies were conducted with manual acupuncture and 2 studies were 
      electroacupuncture. The range of sample size was between 32 and 67. One RCT 
      showed significant improvement in the acupuncture group compared with the sham 
      control group and another RCT showed a statistical difference between the 
      electroacupuncture and waitlist group. The other 2 studies showed no statistical 
      differences between control and acupuncture groups. Two studies conducted blood 
      analysis to elucidate the mechanism of efficacy of acupuncture for arthralgia. 
      The 2 positive studies had a lower ROB and 2 studies had a high ROB. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The systematic review suggests that acupuncture has potential benefits to improve 
      arthralgia caused by AIs. However, further trials of adequate sample size, 
      appropriate control group, and longer follow-up are necessary to investigate the 
      efficacy of acupuncture in AI-induced arthralgia.

AB  - Needle entry site localization remains a challenge for procedures that involve 
      lumbar puncture, for example, epidural anesthesia. To solve the problem, we have 
      developed an image classification algorithm that can automatically identify the 
      bone/interspinous region for ultrasound images obtained from lumbar spine of 
      pregnant patients in the transverse plane. The proposed algorithm consists of 
      feature extraction, feature selection and machine learning procedures. A set of 
      features, including matching values, positions and the appearance of black pixels 
      within pre-defined windows along the midline, were extracted from the ultrasound 
      images using template matching and midline detection methods. A support vector 
      machine was then used to classify the bone images and interspinous images. The 
      support vector machine model was trained with 1,040 images from 26 pregnant 
      subjects and tested on 800 images from a separate set of 20 pregnant patients. A 
      success rate of 95.0% on training set and 93.2% on test set was achieved with the 
      proposed method. The trained support vector machine model was further tested on 
      46 off-line collected videos, and successfully identified the proper needle 
      insertion site (interspinous region) in 45 of the cases. Therefore, the proposed 
      method is able to process the ultrasound images of lumbar spine in an automatic 
      manner, so as to facilitate the anesthetists' work of identifying the needle 
      entry site.

TI  - A rapid and effective nonsurgical artificial insemination protocol using the 
      NSET™ device for sperm transfer in mice without anesthesia.
PG  - 775-81

AB  - Artificial insemination (AI) is an assisted reproductive technique that is 
      implemented successfully in humans as a fertility treatment, performed 
      extensively for commercial breeding of livestock, and is also successful in 
      laboratory rodents. AI in the mouse may be especially useful for breeding of 
      transgenic or mutant mice with fertility problems, expansion of mouse colonies, 
      and as an alternative to in vitro fertilization. Nonsurgical AI techniques for 
      the mouse have been described previously but are not often implemented due to 
      technical difficulties. Here we compare various protocols for preparation of CD1 
      recipients prior to AI for naïve (in estrus), ovulation-induced, and 
      superovulated females. Timing of hormone administration relative to sperm 
      delivery is also compared. An improved protocol for nonsurgical AI in mice is 
      described, which incorporates a convenient hormone administration schedule for 
      female recipients and rapid, non-stressful sperm transfer without the need for 
      anesthesia or analgesia.

TI  - Real-time ultrasound image classification for spine anesthesia using local 
      directional Hadamard features.
PG  - 901-12

AB  - PURPOSE: Injection therapy is a commonly used solution for back pain management. 
      This procedure typically involves percutaneous insertion of a needle between or 
      around the vertebrae, to deliver anesthetics near nerve bundles. Most frequently, 
      spinal injections are performed either blindly using palpation or under the 
      guidance of fluoroscopy or computed tomography. Recently, due to the drawbacks of 
      the ionizing radiation of such imaging modalities, there has been a growing 
      interest in using ultrasound imaging as an alternative. However, the complex 
      spinal anatomy with different wave-like structures, affected by speckle noise, 
      makes the accurate identification of the appropriate injection plane difficult. 
      The aim of this study was to propose an automated system that can identify the 
      optimal plane for epidural steroid injections and facet joint injections. 
      METHODS: A multi-scale and multi-directional feature extraction system to provide 
      automated identification of the appropriate plane is proposed. Local Hadamard 
      coefficients are obtained using the sequency-ordered Hadamard transform at 
      multiple scales. Directional features are extracted from local coefficients which 
      correspond to different regions in the ultrasound images. An artificial neural 
      network is trained based on the local directional Hadamard features for 
      classification. RESULTS: The proposed method yields distinctive features for 
      classification which successfully classified 1032 images out of 1090 for epidural 
      steroid injection and 990 images out of 1052 for facet joint injection. In order 
      to validate the proposed method, a leave-one-out cross-validation was performed. 
      The average classification accuracy for leave-one-out validation was 94 % for 
      epidural and 90 % for facet joint targets. Also, the feature extraction time for 
      the proposed method was 20 ms for a native 2D ultrasound image. CONCLUSION: A 
      real-time machine learning system based on the local directional Hadamard 
      features extracted by the sequency-ordered Hadamard transform for detecting the 
      laminae and facet joints in ultrasound images has been proposed. The system has 
      the potential to assist the anesthesiologists in quickly finding the target plane 
      for epidural steroid injections and facet joint injections.

TI  - Water Exchange Is the Least Painful Colonoscope Insertion Technique and Increases 
      Completion of Unsedated Colonoscopy.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Unsedated colonoscopy is acceptable for diagnostic, 
      surveillance, and screening indications worldwide. However, insertion of the 
      colonoscope can be painful; it is not clear which technique is least painful and 
      thereby increases the likelihood of colonoscopy completion. We performed a 
      head-to-head comparison of air insufflation (AI), carbon dioxide (CO2) 
      insufflation, water immersion (WI), and water exchange (WE) to determine which 
      combination of insertion techniques produces the least amount of pain. METHODS: 
      In a patient-blinded prospective trial, 624 subjects were assigned randomly to 
      groups that underwent colonoscopy with AI-AI, CO2-CO2, WI-AI, WE-AI, WI-CO2, or 
      WE-CO2 insertion and withdrawal techniques, including on-demand sedation, at the 
      St. Barbara Hospital (Iglesias, Italy) or the Vìtkovice Hospital (Ostrava, Czech 
      Republic), from October 2013 through June 2014. The primary outcome was real-time 
      maximum insertion pain (0 = none, 10 = worst), recorded by an unblinded nurse 
      assistant. At discharge, a blinded observer recorded the recalled maximum 
      insertion pain and patients' and investigators' guesses about method or gas used. 
      RESULTS: Patients and investigators correctly guessed the method used for fewer 
      than 44% of procedures, confirming adequate blinding. The correlation between 
      real-time and recalled maximum insertion pain (r = 0.9; P < .0005) confirmed 
      internal validation of the primary outcome. The WE group had the lowest scores: 
      mean pain values were 5.2 for AI-AI (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6-5.8), 4.9 
      for CO2-CO2 (95% CI, 4.3-5.4), 4.3 for WI-CO2 (95% CI, 3.8-4.9), 4.0 for WI-AI 
      (95% CI, 3.5-4.5), 3.1 for WE-CO2 (95% CI, 2.7-3.4), and 3.1 for WE-AI (95% CI, 
      2.7-3.6) (P < .0005). The highest proportions of patients completing unsedated 
      colonoscopy were in the WE groups. WE groups also had significantly better colon 
      cleanliness, particularly in the transverse and right colon (P < .0005). One 
      limitation of the study was that colonoscopists and assistants were not blinded 
      to water-aided insertion methods. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study of 
      colonoscopy insertion methods, CO2 insufflation did not reduce real-time maximum 
      insertion pain. Compared with AI or CO2, WI and WE reduced insertion pain. The 
      least painful technique was WE, which significantly increased completion of 
      unsedated colonoscopy and bowel cleanliness without prolonging insertion time.

TI  - Relations between arthralgia and fear of recurrence: results of a cross-sectional 
      study of breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitors 
      therapy.
PG  - 3581-8
LID - 10.1007/s00520-015-2722-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore associations between arthralgia and 
      fear of recurrence in breast cancer patients treated by aromatase inhibitors 
      (AI). METHOD: We sent a set of questionnaires to 100 patients examining their 
      pain characteristics, anxiety (STAI), depression (BDI-SF), quality of life 
      (SF-36), fear of recurrence (FCRI), and representations of AI treatment (ad hoc 
      questionnaire). Nonparametric tests were used to investigate between-group 
      comparisons (arthralgia vs. nonarthralgia) in these domains as well as the 
      associations between arthralgia and fear of recurrence. RESULTS: Of the 77 
      patients who returned the questionnaires (response rate = 77%), 60 (78%) reported 
      arthralgia. The mean score of fear of recurrence exceeded the pathological 
      threshold in the arthralgia group and was significantly higher than that in the 
      nonarthralgia group (14.8 vs. 10.7, p < 0.01). Significant associations were 
      observed between fear of recurrence and pain intensity (r = 0.274, p < 0.05) and 
      pain relief (r = -0.409, p < 0.05). More than 80% of the total sample declared 
      that they were well informed about the aim of AI, their side effects, and the 
      risk of developing arthralgia. Fear of recurrence did not appear to be associated 
      with representations of AI. CONCLUSION: The study revealed a close relationship 
      between pain intensity and fear of recurrence. In particular, it showed that 
      effective pain management was accompanied by a reduced fear of recurrence. 
      Information, although essential, appeared insufficient to overcome patients' 
      concerns about pain. Therefore, the implement of a systematic screening for 
      arthralgia and the improvement of analgesic treatment are essential issues. New 
      strategies for pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment must be 
      developed.

TI  - Gas induction for pyloromyotomy.
PG  - 677-80
LID - 10.1111/pan.12633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants with pyloric stenosis are considered to be at high risk of 
      aspiration on induction of anesthesia. Traditionally, texts have recommended 
      classic rapid sequence induction (RSI) or awake intubation (AI). AI has generally 
      fallen out of favor, while the components of RSI have become increasingly 
      controversial. Infants are at high risk of hypoxemia if ventilation is not 
      maintained while waiting for neuromuscular blockade to establish. The efficacy of 
      cricoid pressure (CP) to prevent aspiration has not been proven. It can impair 
      visualization of the glottis and make intubation difficult. It is debatable 
      whether any RSI technique is needed for pyloromyotomy. A recent review of 235 
      infants reported no aspiration events. These children were anesthetized with a 
      variety of techniques, including RSI, gas induction, and AI. In our institution, 
      we teach a gaseous induction. The nasogastric tube is used to empty the stomach 
      and anesthesia is induced with sevoflurane. A nondepolarizing muscle relaxant is 
      administered and ventilation maintained until neuromuscular blockade is 
      established and intubating conditions are optimal. We report our experience of 
      this technique. METHOD: A retrospective medical notes review of all patients 
      undergoing pyloromyotomy between 2005 and 2012. RESULTS: There were 269 patients 
      (84.4% male, mean weight 3.74 kg ± 0.74). Two hundred and fifty-two (93.7%) 
      received gas inductions and 17 (6.3%) intravenous (IV) inductions. Two children 
      received an RSI. No patient-specific factors were identified to explain operator 
      choice in those receiving IV inductions. There were no recorded aspiration 
      events. CONCLUSION: Gas induction can be considered for children undergoing 
      pyloromyotomy.

TI  - Left-colon water exchange preserves the benefits of whole colon water exchange at 
      reduced cecal intubation time conferring significant advantage in diagnostic 
      colonoscopy - a prospective, randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 916-23
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2015.1010569 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Whole-colon water exchange (WWE) reduces insertion pain, increases 
      cecal intubation success and adenoma detection rate, but requires longer 
      insertion time, compared to air insufflation (AI) colonoscopy. We hypothesized 
      that water exchange limited to the left colon (LWE) can speed up insertion with 
      equivalent results. METHODS: This prospective, randomized controlled study 
      (NCT01735266) allocated patients (18-80 years) to WWE, LWE or AI group (1:1:1). 
      The primary outcome was cecal intubation time. RESULTS: Three hundred subjects 
      were randomized to the WWE (n = 100), LWE (n = 100) or AI group (n = 100). 
      Ninety-four to ninety-five per cent of patients underwent diagnostic colonoscopy. 
      Baseline characteristics were balanced. The median insertion time was shorter in 
      LWE group (4.8 min (95%CI: 3.2-6.2)) than those in WWE (7.5 min (95%CI: 
      6.0-10.3)) and AI (6.4 min (95%CI: 4.2-9.8)) (both p < 0.001) groups. The cecal 
      intubation rates in unsedated patients of the two water exchange methods (WWE 
      99%, LWE 99%) were significantly higher than that (89.8%) in AI group (p = 0.01). 
      The final success rates were comparable among the three groups after sedation was 
      given. Maximum pain scores and number of patients needing abdominal compression 
      between WWE and LWE groups were comparable, both lower than those in AI group (p 
      < 0.05). No significant difference was observed regarding PDR, although the PDR 
      in right colon tended to be higher in WWE group. CONCLUSION: By preserving the 
      benefits of WWE and reducing insertion time, LWE is appropriate for diagnostic 
      colonoscopy, especially in settings with tight scheduling of patients. The higher 
      PDR in the right colon in WWE group deserves to be further investigated.

PG  - 635-42
AB  - Hybrid imaging systems, consisting of fluoroscopy and echocardiography, are 
      increasingly selected for intra-operative support of minimally invasive cardiac 
      interventions. Intracardiac echocardiograpy (ICE) is an emerging modality with 
      the promise of removing sedation or general anesthesia associated with 
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). We introduce a novel 6 degrees of freedom 
      (DoF) pose estimation approach for catheters (equipped with radiopaque ball 
      markers) in single X-Ray fluoroscopy projection and investigate the method's 
      application to a prototype ICE catheter. Machine learning based catheter 
      detection is implemented in a Bayesian hypothesis fusion framework, followed by 
      refinement of ball marker locations through template matching. Marker 
      correspondence and 3D pose estimation are solved through iterative optimization. 
      The method registers the ICE volume to the C-arm coordinate system. Experiments 
      are performed on synthetic and porcine in-vivo data. Target registration error 
      (TRE), defined in the echo cone, is the basis of our preliminary evaluation. The 
      method reached 8.06 ± 7.2 mm TRE on 703 cases. Potential uses of our hybrid 
      system include structural heart disease interventions and electrophysiologycal 
      mapping or catheter ablation procedures.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this project was to explore the chronic pain experience 
      and establish cultural appropriateness of cognitive behavioral pain management 
      (CBPM) techniques in American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). DESIGN: A 
      semistructured interview guide was used with three focus groups of AI/AN patients 
      in the U.S. Southwest and Pacific Northwest regions to explore pain and CBPM in 
      AI/ANs. FINDINGS: The participants provided rich qualitative data regarding 
      chronic pain and willingness to use CBPM. Themes included empty promises and 
      health care insufficiencies, individuality, pain management strategies, and 
      suggestions for health care providers. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that there is 
      room for improvement in chronic pain care among AI/ANs and that CBPM would likely 
      be a viable and culturally appropriate approach for chronic pain management. 
      IMPLICATIONS: This research provides evidence that CBPM is culturally acceptable 
      and in alignment with existing traditional AI/AN strategies for coping and 
      healing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Technology 
      Status Evaluation Report recommended comparative studies of water-aided 
      colonoscopy methods to refine the optimal insertion technique. OBJECTIVE: Air 
      insufflation (AI), water immersion (WI), and water exchange (WE) were compared 
      head-to-head to test the hypothesis that WE produces the least insertion pain. 
      DESIGN: Patient-blinded, prospective, randomized, controlled trials. SETTING: Two 
      community hospitals in Italy. PATIENTS: First-time diagnostic or screening 
      colonoscopy in unsedated patients with the option of on-demand sedation. 
      INTERVENTION: Colonoscopy with AI, WI, or WE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: 
      Real-time maximum insertion pain (0 = none, 10 = worst). To avoid interventional 
      bias, the timing of recording was at the discretion of the nurse assistant. 
      Adjunct measures were implemented to ensure patient perception of minimal 
      discomfort. Recalled pain and patients' guess of insertion methods were recorded 
      after colonoscopy. RESULTS: Results were merged for 576 randomized patients. 
      Correct patient guesses lower than 33% confirmed adequate blinding. Significant 
      correlation (Pearson coefficient 0.6, P < .0005) between real-time and recalled 
      pain provided internal validation of the former as the primary outcome. Real-time 
      pain (95% confidence interval [CI]: AI, 4.1 [3.7-4.5]; WI, 3.5 [3.0-3.9]; and WE, 
      2.5 [2.2-2.9] [P < .0005] was the lowest in the WE group. The proportions of 
      patients completing unsedated colonoscopy based on the assigned methods were 
      significantly different (WE, 74.7% vs WI, 62.4%; P = .009; vs AI, 65.3%; P = 
      .04). WE required the least implementation of adjunct maneuvers. LIMITATIONS: 
      Unblinded colonoscopists. CONCLUSION: The current findings with an internally 
      validated primary outcome in adequately blinded patients support the hypothesis 
      that WE is superior to WI in attenuating real-time insertion pain and enhancing 
      completion of unsedated colonoscopy.

AB  - Segmentation of needles in ultrasound images remains a challenging problem. In 
      this paper, we introduce a machine learning-based method for needle segmentation 
      in 2D beam-steered ultrasound images. We used a statistical boosting approach to 
      train a pixel-wise classifier for needle segmentation. The Radon transform was 
      then used to find the needle position and orientation from the segmented image. 
      We validated our method with data from ex vivo specimens and clinical nerve block 
      procedures, and compared the results to those obtained using previously reported 
      needle segmentation methods. Results show improved localization success and 
      accuracy using the proposed method. For the ex vivo datasets, assuming that the 
      needle orientation was known a priori, the needle was successfully localized in 
      86.2% of the images, with a mean targeting error of 0.48mm. The robustness of the 
      proposed method to a lack of a priori knowledge of needle orientation was also 
      demonstrated. For the clinical datasets, assuming that the needle orientation was 
      closely aligned with the beam steering angle selected by the physician, the 
      needle was successfully localized in 99.8% of the images, with a mean targeting 
      error 0.19mm. These results indicate that the learning-based segmentation method 
      may allow for increased targeting accuracy and enhanced visualization during 
      ultrasound-guided needle procedures.

TI  - Critical care and vitamin D status assessment: what about immunoassays and 
      calculated free 25OH-D?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interpretation of 25OH-D measurement during critical care (CC) may be 
      problematic due to variations of binding protein concentrations (albumin, ALB, 
      and vitamin D binding protein, VDBP). Determination of free 25OH-D concentration 
      may thus be relevant in CC patients. The aim of this observational study was to 
      evaluate effects of an acute hemodilution on vitamin D (VD) status. METHODS: 
      Blood samples were obtained before (T1) and after a crystalloid load (T2) 
      administered at anesthesia induction for minor surgery. 25OH-D was measured with 
      LC-MS/MS and with 3 immunoassays (IA): DiaSorin Liaison, IDS iSYS and bioMérieux 
      Vidas. VDBP was measured with the R&D Elisa and ALB on Cobas. Free 25OH-D was 
      calculated using published formula. Accuracy of each 25OH-D IA was calculated as 
      the percentage of IA values within 20% of their respective LC-MS/MS values. 
      Performances of the three AI were compared with LC-MC/MS using Bland-Altman 
      analysis. RESULTS: Twenty adults were included. Compared to T1 values, VDBP, ALB 
      and LC-MS/MS values decreased in parallel by a mean of 23% at T2. IA values 
      decreased less significantly (12, 14 and 15% for Liaison, iSYS and Vidas, 
      respectively). IA-based calculated free 25OH-D significantly increased after 
      dilution, while LC-MS/MS-based free values remained stable. At T1 and T2, bias 
      were demonstrable for all IA. After hemodilution, bias would lead to 
      overestimation for the three IA. Accuracy of IA decreased after dilution. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Due to matrix effects, compared to LC-MS/MS, IA results were 
      impacted by hemodilution. In CC patients, LC-MS/MS seems to be the best option to 
      measure 25OH-D. Specific LC-MS/MS method should be developed to measure free 
      25OH-D.

TI  - Successful nonsurgical artificial insemination and hormonal monitoring in an 
      Asiatic golden cat (Catopuma temmincki).
PG  - 372-9
AB  - Since it is reported to be difficult to establish Asiatic golden cat (Catopuma 
      temmincki) breeding pairs in captivity as a result of overaggressive behavior of 
      the male, artificial insemination (AI) may be a desired option by which to 
      achieve pregnancy. This approach was chosen in the present case involving a 
      nulliparous, 6-yr-old female cat that was inseminated transcervically during a 
      naturally occurring estrus, which therefore required only a single general 
      anesthetic procedure. On day 4 of estrus behavior, the male was anesthetized and 
      semen was collected via urethral catheterization (UC) to recover spermatozoa in 
      high concentration followed by electroejaculation (EE) to obtain additional semen 
      and seminal fluid. The fresh UC semen, totaling 180 microl in volume and 
      containing spermatozoa showing 55-70% sperm motility, was inseminated 2.5 hr 
      later via a commercial cat urinary catheter passed through the cervix into the 
      uterus. Immediately afterwards, the EE fraction (100 microl) was inseminated 
      deeply into the dorsal medial fold of the vagina. The GnRH analogue Receptal 
      (0.75 ml, i.m.) was given during anesthesia in an attempt to induce ovulation. 
      Increasing fecal concentrations of progesterone after AI and a significant rise 
      in fecal prostaglandin F2alpha metabolite (PGFM) concentrations (P < 0.0001) from 
      day 45 post-AI indicated that the cat had conceived, and it produced healthy twin 
      cubs after an 84-day gestation.

TI  - A patient-blinded randomized, controlled trial comparing air insufflation, water 
      immersion, and water exchange during minimally sedated colonoscopy.
PG  - 1390-400
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.126 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Minimal sedation obviates patient recovery burdens, but intolerable 
      pain limits success of cecal intubation. Painless or minimally uncomfortable 
      insertion ensures success of cecal intubation, current patient satisfaction, and 
      willingness to repeat future colonoscopy with minimal sedation. Water immersion 
      (WI) and water exchange (WE), when separately compared with air insufflation 
      (AI), significantly reduced insertion pain. To assess comparative effectiveness, 
      we conducted a randomized controlled trial with head-to-head comparison of these 
      three methods. We hypothesized that WE could produce the highest proportion of 
      patients reporting painless insertion. METHODS: This prospective patient-blinded 
      trial (NCT01535326) enrolled minimally sedated (25 mg intramuscular meperidine) 
      patients randomized to AI, WI, or WE (90 patients/group) to aid insertion. The 
      previously validated primary outcome was the proportion of patients reporting 
      painless insertion. RESULTS: Painless insertion was reported by 30.0% (AI), 43.3% 
      (WI), and 61.1% (WE) of patients (P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis revealed that, after adjusting for gender, body mass index, abdominal 
      compression, position change, insertion time to cecum, and length of scope at 
      cecum, only WE was significantly associated with painless insertion compared with 
      AI (odds ratio (OR)=0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.03-0.24, P<0.001) or WI 
      (OR=0.14, 95% CI=0.05-0.40, P<0.001). Adenoma detection rate (ADR) in the right 
      (cecum and ascending) colon was 11.1% (AI), 14.4% (WI), and 26.7% (WE) (P=0.015). 
      The limitations included single site study with unblinded colonoscopist and 
      assistant. CONCLUSIONS: This head-to-head comparison of AI vs. WI vs. WE 
      confirmed that WE was superior to WI and AI, with a significantly greater 
      proportion of patients reporting painless insertion. The significantly higher ADR 
      in the right colon in the WE group warrants further investigations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The occurrence of pain accounts for billions of dollars in annual 
      medical expenditures; loss of quality of life and decreased worker productivity 
      contribute to indirect costs. As pain is highly subjective, clinical decision 
      support systems (CDSSs) can be critical for improving the accuracy of pain 
      assessment and offering better support for clinical decision-making. This review 
      is focused on computer technologies for pain management that allow CDSSs to 
      obtain knowledge from the clinical data produced by either patients or health 
      care professionals. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comprehensive literature search was 
      conducted in several electronic databases to identify relevant articles focused 
      on computerised systems that constituted CDSSs and include data or results 
      related to pain symptoms from patients with acute or chronic pain, published 
      between 1992 and 2011 in the English language. In total, thirty-nine studies were 
      analysed; thirty-two were selected from 1245 citations, and seven were obtained 
      from reference tracking. RESULTS: The results highlighted the following clusters 
      of computer technologies: rule-based algorithms, artificial neural networks, 
      nonstandard set theory, and statistical learning algorithms. In addition, several 
      methodologies were found for content processing such as terminologies, 
      questionnaires, and scores. The median accuracy ranged from 53% to 87.5%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Computer technologies that have been applied in CDSSs are important 
      but not determinant in improving the systems' accuracy and the clinical practice, 
      as evidenced by the moderate correlation among the studies. However, these 
      systems play an important role in the design of computerised systems oriented to 
      a patient's symptoms as is required for pain management. Several limitations 
      related to CDSSs were observed: the lack of integration with mobile devices, the 
      reduced use of web-based interfaces, and scarce capabilities for data to be 
      inserted by patients.

TI  - Investigation of middle ear pressure changes during prone position under general 
      anesthesia without using nitrous oxide.
PG  - 1950-2
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0b013e31829aad7c [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The effects of different body positions on the middle ear were reported 
      in several studies, but there are no data about the effects on patients under 
      general anesthesia. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of prone 
      position on middle ear pressure (MEP) during general anesthesia without using 
      nitrous oxide. METHODS: Twenty patients under general anesthesia during prone 
      position were included in the study. The performed anesthesia method was the same 
      for all patients. Remifentanil was used for analgesia instead of nitrous oxide. 
      MEPs were measured 5 times with a middle ear analyzer: before induction (BI), 
      after intubation (AI), after turned to the prone position (PP1), at the end of 
      the prone position (PP2), and after returned to the supine position (SP). 
      Duration of prone position was also recorded. RESULTS: Of the 20 patients were 11 
      women and 9 men with a 49 ± 13 mean age. BI-AI, AI-PP1, PP1-PP2, and PP2-SP 
      comparisons of both MEPs were statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Right mean 
      MEPs were BI, -1 ± 23 daPa; AI, 41 ± 51 daPa; PP1, 124 ± 76 daPa; PP2, 152 ± 59 
      daPa; and SP, 63 ± 29 daPa; whereas left mean MEPs were BI, -24 ± 55 daPa; AI, 28 
      ± 34 daPa; PP1, 132 ± 67 daPa; PP2, 162 ± 48 daPa; and SP, 70 ± 89 daPa. 
      Significant increases were detected at the start and continuation of the prone 
      position. The mean duration of prone position was 98 ± 51 per minute. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The significant MEP increases during the prone position under 
      general anesthesia depend on a number of reasons. Among them are inhaler agents, 
      pressure changes in mucosal blood vessels due to venous congestion, and the 
      mastoid bone volume. Further researches are required to determine and explain the 
      mechanisms of increase in MEP during prone position.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is linked to the prevalence of 
      obesity, continues to rise in the United States. There are limited data on the 
      risk for sedation-related adverse events (SRAE) in patients with undiagnosed OSA 
      receiving propofol for routine EGD and colonoscopy. OBJECTIVE: To identify the 
      prevalence of OSA by using the STOP-BANG questionnaire (SB) and subsequent risk 
      factors for airway interventions (AI) and SRAE in patients undergoing elective 
      EGD and colonoscopy. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care 
      teaching hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 243 patients undergoing routine EGD or 
      colonoscopy at Cleveland Clinic. INTERVENTION: Chin lift, mask ventilation, 
      placement of nasopharyngeal airway, bag mask ventilation, unplanned endotracheal 
      intubation, hypoxia, hypotension, or early procedure termination. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASUREMENTS: Rates of AI and SRAE. RESULTS: Mean age of the cohort was 50 ± 16.2 
      years, and 41% were male. The prevalence of SB+ was 48.1%. The rates of hypoxia 
      (11.2% vs 16.9%; P = .20) and hypotension (10.4% vs 5.9%; P = .21) were similar 
      between SB- and SB+ patients. An SB score ≥3 was found not to be associated with 
      occurrence of AI (relative risk [RR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-1.5) 
      or SRAE (RR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.53-1.2) after we adjusted for total and loading dose 
      of propofol, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and age. Higher BMI was associated 
      with an increased risk for AI (RR 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04) and SRAE (RR 1.03; 95% 
      CI, 1.01-1.05). Increased patient age (RR 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.2), higher loading 
      propofol doses (RR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8), and smoking (RR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9) 
      were associated with higher rates of SRAE. LIMITATIONS: Non-randomized study. 
      CONCLUSION: A significant number of patients undergoing routine EGD and 
      colonoscopy are at risk for OSA. SB+ patients are not at higher risk for AI or 
      SRAE. However, other risk factors for AI and SRAE have been identified and must 
      be taken into account to optimize patient safety.

AB  - Here we use a modification of the Joint-Peri-Stimulus-Time histogram (JPSTH) to 
      investigate triple correlations between cat auditory cortex neurons. The modified 
      procedure allowed the decomposition of the xy-pair correlation into a part that 
      is due to the correlation of the x and y units with the trigger unit, and a 
      remaining 'pair correlation'. We analyzed 16 sets of 15-minute duration 
      stationary spontaneous recordings in primary auditory cortex (AI) with between 11 
      and 14 electrodes from 2 arrays of 8 electrodes each that provided spontaneous 
      firing rates above 0.22 sp/s and for which reliable frequency-tuning curves could 
      be obtained and the characteristic frequency (CF) was estimated. Thus we 
      evaluated 11,282 conditional cross-correlation functions. The predictor for the 
      conditional cross-correlation, calculated on the assumption that the trigger unit 
      had no effect on the xy-pair correlation but using the same fraction of xy 
      spikes, was equal to the conventional pair-wise correlation function between 
      units xy. The conditional correlation of the xy-pair due to correlation of the x 
      and/or y unit with the trigger unit decreased with the geometric mean distance of 
      the xy pair to the trigger unit, but was independent of the pair 
      cross-correlation coefficient. The conditional pair correlation coefficient was 
      estimated at 78% of the measured pair correlation coefficient. Assuming a 
      geometric decreasing effect of activities of units on other electrodes on the 
      conditional correlation, we estimated the potential contribution of a large 
      number of contributing units on the measured pair correlation at 35-50 of that 
      correlation. This suggests that conventionally measured pair correlations in 
      auditory cortex under ketamine anesthesia overestimate the 'true pair 
      correlation', likely resulting from massive common input, by potentially up to a 
      factor 2.

TI  - Brachial arterial temperature as an indicator of core temperature: proof of 
      concept and potential applications.
PG  - 86-93
AB  - There is potential for heat loss and hypothermia during anesthesia and also for 
      hyperthermia if heat conservation and active warming measures are not accurately 
      titrated. Accurate temperature monitoring is particularly important in procedures 
      in which the patient is actively cooled and then rewarmed such as during 
      cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (CPB). We simultaneously measured core, 
      nasopharyngeal, and brachial artery temperatures to investigate the last named as 
      a potential peripheral temperature monitoring site. Ten patients undergoing 
      hypothermic CPB were instrumented for simultaneous monitoring of temperatures in 
      the pulmonary artery (PA), aortic arterial inflow (AI), nasopharynx (NP), and 
      brachial artery (BA). Core temperature was defined as PA temperature before and 
      after CPB and the AI temperature during CPB. Mean deviations of BA and NP 
      temperatures from core temperature were calculated for three steady-state periods 
      (before, during, and after CPB). Mean deviation of BA and NP temperatures from AI 
      temperature was also calculated during active rewarming. A total of 1862 
      measurements were obtained and logged from eight patients. Mean BA and NP 
      deviations from core temperature across the steady-state periods (before, during, 
      and after CBP) were, respectively: .23 +/- .25, -.26 +/- .3, and -.09 +/- .05 
      degrees C (BA), and .11 +/- .19, -.1 +/- .47, and -.04 +/- .3 degrees C (NP). 
      During steady-state periods, there was no evidence of a difference between the 
      mean BA and NP deviation. During active rewarming, the mean difference between 
      the BA and AI temperatures was .14 +/- .36 degrees C. During this period, NP 
      temperature lagged behind AI and BA temperatures by up to 41 minutes and was up 
      to 5.3 degres C lower than BA (mean difference between BA and NP temperatures was 
      1.22 +/- .58 degrees C). The BA temperature is an adequate surrogate for core 
      temperature. It also accurately tracks the changing AI temperature during 
      rewarming and is therefore potentially useful in detecting a hyperthermic 
      perfusate, which might cause cerebral hyperthermia.

TI  - Adrenal insufficiency in children undergoing heart surgery does not correlate 
      with more complex postoperative course.
PG  - 1860-7
LID - 10.1007/s00246-013-0728-y [doi]
AB  - Although some evidence suggests benefit of steroid supplementation after 
      pediatric cardiac surgery, data correlating adrenal function with the 
      postoperative course is scarce. This study sought to determine if adrenal 
      insufficiency (AI) after cardiac surgery is associated with a more complicated 
      postoperative course in children. A prospective study was performed during a 
      6-month period at a pediatric medical center. Included were 119 children, 3 
      months and older, who underwent heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. 
      Cortisol levels were measured before and 18 h after surgery. Patients were 
      divided into two groups by procedure complexity (low or high), and clinical and 
      laboratory parameters were compared between patients with and without AI within 
      each complexity group. In the low-complexity group, 45 of the 65 patients had AI. 
      The normal adrenal function (NAF) subgroup had greater inotropic support at 12, 
      24, and 36 h after surgery and a higher lactate level at 12 and 24 h after 
      surgery. There were no significant differences between subgroups in duration of 
      ventilation, sedation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, or urine output. In the 
      high-complexity group, 27 patients had AI, and 27 did not. There were no 
      significant differences between subgroups in inotropic support or urine output 
      during the first 36 h or in mechanical ventilation, sedation, or ICU stay 
      duration. Children with AI after heart surgery do not have a more complex 
      postoperative course than children with NAF. The adrenal response of individual 
      patients seems to be appropriate for their cardiovascular status.

TI  - The role of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel in activation 
      of single unit mechanosensitive bladder afferent activities in the rat.
PG  - 544-9
LID - 10.1002/nau.22449 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: We investigated the role of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) 
      channel on the single unit mechanosensitive afferent activities (SAAs) primarily 
      originating from the bladder in the rat. METHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      used. Cystometry with continuous saline instillation was performed after 
      intra-venous cumulative administration of HC-030031 (HC, a selective TRPA1 
      antagonist) at three doses (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) in conscious rats. SAAs 
      primarily originating from the bladder were identified by electrical stimulation 
      of the pelvic nerve and by bladder distention, and divided by conduction velocity 
      as Aδ- or C-fibers under urethane anesthesia. The SAA-investigation was repeated 
      three times with cumulative HC-administration at three doses (0.1, 1.0, and 
      10.0 mg/kg) or single administration of vehicle. In separate experiments, the 
      SAA-investigation was repeated three times with intra-vesical instillation of 
      allyl isothiocyanate (AI, a TRPA1 agonist, 10 µM) or vehicle with or without 
      pretreatment with HC (1.0 mg/kg, 3 min before each intra-vesical instillation of 
      AI). RESULTS: There was no significant change in any cystometric parameters after 
      HC-administrations. A total of 54 SAAs (25 Aδ-fibers and 29 C-fibers) was 
      isolated in 28 rats. SAAs of both fibers significantly decreased after 
      HC-administrations in a dose-dependent manner. SAAs of both fibers significantly 
      increased after AI-instillations. Pretreatment with HC suppressed this excitatory 
      effect of AI-instillation on SAAs. CONCLUSIONS: TRPA1 channel has a role in 
      activation of mechanosensitive afferent nerve activities of both Aδ- and C-fibers 
      of the rat bladder, although its role in a physiological condition might be 
      small. Neurourol. Urodynam. 33:544-549, 2014. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Acupuncture for treatment of arthralgia secondary to aromatase inhibitor therapy 
      in women with early breast cancer: pilot study.
PG  - 264-71
LID - 10.1136/acupmed-2012-010309 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are recommended as adjuvant hormone 
      treatment for postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. A substantial 
      proportion of women taking AIs experience joint pain and stiffness. Studies have 
      suggested that acupuncture may be effective in treating joint pain. OBJECTIVE: A 
      pilot study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of 
      using acupuncture to treat AI-induced arthralgia. METHODS: A total of 32 patients 
      were randomised to receive either sham or real electroacupuncture (EA) twice 
      weekly for 6 weeks. Outcomes of joint pain, stiffness and physical function were 
      measured with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index 
      (WOMAC), overall pain severity and interference with the BPI-SF and quality of 
      life (QOL) with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) 
      instrument. Hand strength was assessed by a grip test, and a serum marker of 
      inflammation (C reactive protein (CRP)) was also measured. All assessments were 
      performed at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks, except for blood samples at baseline 
      and 6 weeks only. RESULTS: No serious adverse events were reported during or 
      after acupuncture treatments. There were no significant differences in outcome 
      measures. However, positive trends were observed in stiffness and physical 
      function at week 12 in favour of real EA. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that 
      acupuncture is feasible and safe in patients with breast cancer with joint pain 
      caused by AI. A larger study with adequately powered to confirm these results and 
      detect clinically relevant effects is needed.

TI  - [Inflammatory-modulating mechanism of transcutaneous electrical acupoint 
      stimulation combined with general anesthesia or controlled hypotension on 
      postoperative hippocampal neuroprotection].
PG  - 149-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of transcutaneous electrical acupoint 
      stimulation (TEAS) combined with general anesthesia or controlled hypotension on 
      hippocampal neuronal damage and the inflammatory response in peripheral 
      circulation and central nervous system (CNS) after surgery, and to investigate 
      its brain protection mechanism. METHODS: Eighteen healthy male beagles aged 6 - 8 
      months were randomly divided into a general anesthesia group (group G), a 
      controlled hypotension group (group C) and a compound anesthesia acupuncture 
      group (group A), 6 cases in each group. Dogs in group G was anesthetized by 
      isoflurane inhalation, and group C was combined with intravenous infusion of 
      sodium nitroprusside based on isoflurane inhalation to induce hypotension, and 
      followed surgery after achieving the target blood pressure, and group A was 
      combined with TEAS at "Quchi" (LI 11), "Hegu" (LI 4) "Zu sanli" (ST 36) and 
      "Sanyinjiao" (SP 6) based on controlled hypotension, and then brain tissue was 
      taken out on the 72 h after mean arterial pressure (MAP) was returned to baseline 
      levels. The concentration of IL-1beta,TNF-alpha in serum at different time points 
      were detected by ELISA. The expression of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, Bcl-2, Bax and 
      cleaved caspase-3 were measured by immunohistochemistry, and the apoptosis of 
      hippocampus were detected by TUNEL. RESULTS: (1) At different time points, the 
      concentration of TNFalpha showed the trend of increase first and then decrease, 
      while IL-1beta concentration represented a trend of decrease first and then 
      increase in both group C and group A, but there were no significant differences 
      in cytokine expression between the two groups (all P > 0.05). (2) The ratio of 
      positive cells of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and caspase-3 in CA1 and CA3 of hippocampus 
      in both group C and A were higher than those in group G (all P < 0.01), and 
      cytokines expression in group A were lower than those in group C (all P < 0.01), 
      and caspase-3 in CA1 in group A was lower than that in group C (P < 0.01). The 
      ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in both group C and A were lower than that in group G (all P < 
      0.01), and that in group A was higher than that in group C (P < 0.01 in CA1, P < 
      0.05 in CA3). (3) The apoptosis index (AI) of hippocampal neurons in both group C 
      and A was significantly higher than that in group G (P < 0.01), while AI in CA1 
      in group A was lower than that in group C (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The TEAS can 
      regulate the expression of inflammatory factor in hippocampus in animals 
      undergoing general anesthesia or con trolled hypotension surgery, further 
      improving Bcl-2/Bax ratio, inhibiting the expression of caspase-3 and reducing 
      neuron apoptosis in hippocampus so as to play a neuroprotection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish rabbit eyeball rupture model by air gun in order to 
      observe and analyze the early injury condition and reasons of retinal cell after 
      eyeball rupture. METHODS: Forty eight healthy rabbits were randomly divided into 
      control group and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after injury groups. After anesthesia, the 
      rabbit eyeball rupture model was established by air gun. Then the early 
      pathological changes of rabbit retina were observed, and apoptotic index (AI), 
      oncosis index (OI), the relationship between the expression amounts of 
      apoptosis-related genes and AI were analyzed. RESULTS: Obvious pathological 
      lesion appeared in retina 6 h after injury. Irreversible damage occurred 12-24 h 
      after injury. The results of AI and OI indicated that the OI peak appeared 6 h 
      after injury and then gradually declined, while the AI increased with the 
      prolongation of time, and the AI was higher than OI in 12 h after injury. 
      Immunohistochemical results indicated that there was no obvious bcl-2 protein 
      expression change. Compared with the control group and the 3, 6, 12 and 24 h 
      after the injury groups, the expressions of p53 and Caspase-3 were significantly 
      improved and peaked at 12 h (P<0.01). Positive correlation existed among p53, 
      Caspase-3 expression amount and cell apoptosis amount. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis and 
      oncosis of visual cells are the main reasons of retinal cell injury. p53 and 
      Caspase-3 are the important factors in promoting the retinal cell apoptosis after 
      eyeball rupture.

TI  - The effects of desflurane and sevoflurane on the intraocular pressure associated 
      with endotracheal intubation in pediatric ophthalmic surgery.
PG  - 117-21
LID - 10.4097/kjae.2013.64.2.117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For ophthalmic surgery anesthesia, it is vital that intraocular 
      pressure (IOP) is controlled. Most anesthetic drugs affect IOP dose-dependently, 
      and inhalational anesthetics dose-dependently decrease IOP. In this study, we 
      compared the effects of desflurane and sevoflurane on IOP and hemodynamics in 
      pediatric ophthalmic surgery. METHODS: Thirty eight pediatric patients from the 
      age of 6 to 15 years, who were scheduled for strabismus surgery and entropion 
      surgery, were randomized to be administered desflurane (group D, n = 19) or 
      sevoflurane (group S, n = 19). IOPs and hemodynamic parameters were measured 
      before induction of anesthesia (B), after induction but immediately before 
      intubation (AI), 1 min after intubation (T1), 3 min after intubation (T3), and 5 
      min after intubation (T5). RESULTS: The mean arterial pressure (MAP) at T1 and 
      heart rates (HRs) at T1 and T3 were significantly higher in group D than those in 
      group S. There was no significant difference between the groups in IOP, cardiac 
      index (CI) and stroke index (SI). There was a significant difference within the 
      group in IOP, SI, MAP and HR. There was no significant difference within the 
      group in CI. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between the groups 
      in IOP and hemodynamic parameters. The two anesthetic agents maintained IOP and 
      hemodynamic parameters in the normal range during anesthetic induction.

AB  - CONTEXT: Although minority patients with cancer are more likely to be 
      undermedicated for cancer pain than non-Hispanic whites, little is known about 
      the experience of cancer pain in American Indians (AIs). OBJECTIVES: To describe 
      the experience of cancer and cancer pain in a sample of southwestern AIs. 
      METHODS: Ethnographic interviews were conducted with 13 patients and 11 health 
      care providers, caregivers, and community members; two questionnaires were used 
      to collect demographic and pain data. RESULTS: Barriers to pain control among AIs 
      included difficulties describing pain, a belief that cancer pain is inevitable 
      and untreatable, and an aversion to taking opioid pain medication. Prescriber 
      inexperience also was cited as a barrier to pain management. AIs described a 
      strong desire to protect their privacy regarding their illness, and many felt 
      that expressing pain was a sign of weakness. The inability to participate in 
      spiritual and cultural activities caused AIs distress, and some discontinued 
      treatment or missed chemotherapy appointments to engage in these activities. 
      CONCLUSION: Results revealed new knowledge about the cancer pain experience in 
      AIs. The observation of the close relationship between treatment compliance and 
      the patient's ability to participate in ceremonial and spiritual activities 
      provides new insight into the problem of incomplete cancer treatment in this 
      population. The finding that AI patients have a multidimensional 
      conceptualization of pain will assist clinicians with obtaining more detailed and 
      informative pain assessments.
