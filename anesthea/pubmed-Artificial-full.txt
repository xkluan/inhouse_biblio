TI  - General anesthesia enhances lesion quality and ablation efficiency of 
      circumferential pulmonary vein isolation.
PG  - 76-82
LID - 10.1002/joa3.12960 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is the cornerstone of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) ablation. General anesthesia (GA) resolves the problem of pain 
      intolerability and provides regular respiratory mode which might improve the 
      catheter maneuverability of AF ablation. This study aims to compare the 
      procedural performance of PVI under GA versus conscious sedation (CS) from 
      multiple perspectives. METHODS: A total of 36 consecutive patients undergoing 
      first AF ablation under GA were enrolled in GA group. Another 109 patients 
      receiving AF ablation under CS in the same period were selected as the control 
      group. After propensity score matching, 29 matched pairs with similar baseline 
      characteristics were available for further analysis. The AIFV (using AI to 
      analyze the raw data from CARTO3 system) system was used to evaluate six 
      procedural parameters in each PVI procedure. RESULTS: Compared with CS, PVI under 
      GA had a significantly shorter total PVI time (51.4 min vs. 67.8 min; p = .003) 
      and higher radiofrequency ratio (62.6% vs. 55.8%; p = .032). The number of gaps 
      (1.0 vs. 3.0; p < .001) and the rate of break point were significantly lower in 
      the GA group. GA was also associated with a higher effective ablation-index ratio 
      (87.5% vs. 74.1%; p < .001) and effective force-over-time ratio (85.3% vs. 69.2%; 
      p = .001). After a medium follow-up time of 24 months, 12/29 (41.4%) patients in 
      the CS group and 6/29 (20.7%) patients in the GA group suffered from AF 
      recurrence (p = .156). CONCLUSIONS: GA improves the lesion quality and procedural 
      efficiency of PVI from multiple perspectives evaluated by the AIFV system.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we were aimed to identify important variables via 
      machine learning algorithms and predict postoperative delirium (POD) occurrence 
      in older patients. METHODS: This study was to make the secondary analysis of data 
      from a randomized controlled trial. The Boruta function was used to screen 
      relevant basic characteristic variables. Four models including Logistic 
      Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), the Classification and Regression Tree 
      (CART), and Random Forest (RF) were established from the data set using repeated 
      cross validation, hyper-parameter optimization, and Smote technique (Synthetic 
      minority over-sampling technique, Smote), with the calculation of confusion 
      matrix parameters and the plotting of Receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (ROC), Precision recall curve (PRC), and partial dependence graph for further 
      analysis and evaluation. RESULTS: The basic characteristic variables resulting 
      from Boruta screening included grouping, preoperative Mini-Mental State 
      Examination(MMSE), CHARLSON score, preoperative HCT, preoperative serum 
      creatinine, intraoperative bleeding volume, intraoperative urine volume, 
      anesthesia duration, operation duration, postoperative morphine dosage, intensive 
      care unit (ICU) duration, tracheal intubation duration, and 7-day postoperative 
      rest and move pain score (median and max; VAS-Rest-M, VAS-Move-M, VAS-Rest-Max, 
      and VAS-Move-Max). And Random Forest (RF) showed the best performance in the 
      testing set among the 4 models with Accuracy: 0.9878; Matthews correlation 
      coefficient (MCC): 0.8763; Area under ROC curve (AUC-ROC): 1.0; Area under the 
      PRC Curve (AUC-PRC): 1.0. CONCLUSION: A high-performance algorithm was 
      established and verified in this study demonstrating the degree of POD risk 
      changes in perioperative elderly patients. And the major risk factors for the 
      development of POD were CREA and VAS-Move-Max.

TI  - Antinociceptive Effects of Cannabichromene (CBC) in Mice: Insights from von Frey, 
      Tail-Flick, Formalin, and Acetone Tests.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines12010083 [doi]
LID - 83
AB  - Cannabis sativa contains minor cannabinoids that have potential therapeutic value 
      in pain management. However, detailed experimental evidence for the 
      antinociceptive effects of many of these minor cannabinoids remains lacking. 
      Here, we employed artificial intelligence (AI) to perform compound-protein 
      interaction estimates with cannabichromene (CBC) and receptors involved in 
      nociceptive signaling. Based on our findings, we investigated the antinociceptive 
      properties of CBC in naïve or neuropathic C57BL/6 male and female mice using von 
      Frey (mechanical allodynia), tail-flick (noxious radiant heat), formalin (acute 
      and persistent inflammatory pain), and acetone (cold thermal) tests. For von Frey 
      assessments, CBC dose (0-20 mg/kg, i.p.) and time (0-6 h) responses were measured 
      in male and female neuropathic mice. For tail-flick, formalin, and acetone 
      assays, CBC (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to naïve male and female mice 1 h 
      prior to testing. The results show that CBC (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly 
      reduced mechanical allodynia in neuropathic male and female mice 1-2 h after 
      treatment. Additionally, CBC treatment caused significant reductions in 
      nociceptive behaviors in the tail-flick assay and in both phase 1 and phase 2 of 
      the formalin test. Finally, we found a significant interaction in neuropathic 
      male mice in the acetone test. In conclusion, our results suggest that CBC 
      targets receptors involved in nociceptive signaling and imparts antinociceptive 
      properties that may benefit males and females afflicted with diverse forms of 
      acute or chronic/persistent pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study used machine learning algorithms to identify important 
      variables and predict postinduction hypotension (PIH) in patients undergoing 
      colorectal tumor resection surgery. METHODS: Data from 318 patients who underwent 
      colorectal tumor resection under general anesthesia were analyzed. The training 
      and test sets are divided based on the timeline. The Boruta algorithm was used to 
      screen relevant basic characteristic variables and establish a model for the 
      training set. Four models, regression tree, K-nearest neighbor, neural network, 
      and random forest (RF), were built using repeated cross-validation and 
      hyperparameter optimization. The best model was selected, and a sorting chart of 
      the feature variables, a univariate partial dependency profile, and a breakdown 
      profile were drawn. R(2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), 
      and root MSE (RMSE) were used to plot regression fitting curves for the training 
      and test sets. RESULTS: The basic feature variables associated with the Boruta 
      screening were age, sex, body mass index, L3 skeletal muscle index, and HUAC. In 
      the optimal RF model, R(2) was 0.7708 and 0.7591, MAE was 0.0483 and 0.0408, MSE 
      was 0.0038 and 0.0028, and RMSE was 0.0623 and 0.0534 for the training and test 
      sets, respectively. CONCLUSION: A high-performance algorithm was established and 
      validated to demonstrate the degree of change in blood pressure after induction 
      to control important characteristic variables and reduce PIH occurrence.

AB  - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a type of primary adrenal insufficiency 
      (AI) that predisposes to adrenal crisis (AC) during stress. We describe a case of 
      a primipara with CAH who was admitted in labor. To prevent AC, glucocorticoid 
      replacement was given according to guidelines. Due to fetal decelerations, an 
      emergency C-section was performed under general anesthesia following which 
      refractory hypotension emerged. The diagnosis of AC was considered, and 
      hydrocortisone was given with sustained hemodynamic improvement. AC is a 
      life-threatening emergency whose diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. 
      Despite adequate steroid coverage, additional stressors may precipitate AC, so it 
      is of paramount importance that anesthesiologists consider this emergency.

TI  - Identification of Anesthetic-Induced Cardiovascular Biomarkers in Off-Pump 
      Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery Using Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network 
      Analysis and Machine Learning.
PG  - E740-E754
LID - 10.59958/hsf.6809 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to select anesthesia-induced zinc finger 
      protein-related gene biomarkers that predict cardiovascular function during 
      off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG). METHODS: Gene expression data 
      from GSE4386 included 20 post-anesthesia and 20 pre-anesthesia atrial tissue 
      samples. Zinc finger protein-related genes (ZFPRGs) were searched in the UniProt 
      database and anesthesia-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
      identified Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to 
      screen hub genes, and three machine learning algorithms were used to further 
      screen for cardiovascular biomarkers. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using a 
      nomogram model. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to analyze the pathways 
      enriched by the biomarkers. A microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA-transcription factor (TF) 
      regulatory network was established to explore the potential regulatory mechanisms 
      of these biomarkers. Disease-related drugs were predicted using the Comparative 
      Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). RESULTS: A total of 1102 cardioprotection-related 
      DEGs were selected between the pre- and post-anesthesia groups. Additionally, 
      1095 hub genes were obtained based on WGCNA, and 2274 ZFPRGs were downloaded from 
      the UniProt database. After Venn analysis and machine learning, ZNF420, RNF135, 
      and BNC2 were selected as cardioprotection-related zinc finger biomarkers during 
      OPCABG. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and nomogram models 
      confirmed the diagnostic value and accuracy of the three cardioprotective 
      biomarkers. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that ZNF420 is involved in the 
      cell cycle and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. RNF135 and BNC2 were enriched in the 
      oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In the constructed miRNA-mRNA-TF network, 
      miR-182-5p and miR-16-5p simultaneously regulated three cardioprotective 
      biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Three cardioprotection-related zinc finger protein 
      biomarkers (ZNF420, RNF135, and BNC2) were identified using OPCABG samples.

TI  - The Lifelong Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Clinical Prediction Models on 
      Patients With Tetralogy of Fallot.
PG  - 440-452
LID - 10.1016/j.cjcpc.2023.08.005 [doi]
AB  - Medical advancements in the diagnosis, surgical techniques, perioperative care, 
      and continued care throughout childhood have transformed the outlook for 
      individuals with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), improving survival and shifting the 
      perspective towards lifelong care. However, with a growing population of 
      survivors, longstanding challenges have been accentuated, and new challenges have 
      surfaced, necessitating a re-evaluation of TOF care. Availability of prenatal 
      diagnostics, insufficient information from traditional imaging techniques, 
      previously unforeseen medical complications, and debates surrounding optimal 
      timing and indications for reintervention are among the emerging issues. To 
      address these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine 
      learning holds great promise as they have the potential to revolutionize patient 
      management and positively impact lifelong outcomes for individuals with TOF. 
      Innovative applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have 
      spanned across multiple domains of TOF care, including screening and diagnosis, 
      automated image processing and interpretation, clinical risk stratification, and 
      planning and performing cardiac interventions. By embracing these advancements 
      and incorporating them into routine clinical practice, personalized medicine 
      could be delivered, leading to the best possible outcomes for patients. In this 
      review, we provide an overview of these evolving applications and emphasize the 
      challenges, limitations, and future potential for integrating them into clinical 
      care.
