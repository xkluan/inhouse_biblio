AB  - AIM: To identify the most influential publications relating to artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in radiology in order to identify current trends in the 
      literature and to highlight areas requiring further research. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A retrospective bibliometric analysis was performed of the top 100 most 
      cited articles on this topic. Data pertaining to year of publication, publishing 
      journal, journal impact factor, authorship, article title, institution, country, 
      type of article, article subject, and keywords were collected. RESULTS: The 
      number of citations per article for the top 100 list ranged from 254 to 3,576 
      (median 353). The number of citations per year, per article ranged from 10.4 to 
      894 (median 65.6). The majority of articles (n=62) were published within the last 
      10 years. The USA was the most common country of origin (n=44). The journal with 
      the greatest number of articles was IEEE Transactions On Medical Imaging (n=38). 
      University Medical Center Utrecht contributed the greatest number of articles 
      (n=6). There were 92 original research articles, 52 of which were clinical 
      studies. The most common clinical subjects were neuroimaging (n=25) and oncology 
      (n=16). The most common keyword used was "deep learning" (n=34). CONCLUSION: This 
      study provides an in-depth analysis of the top 100 most-cited papers on the use 
      of AI in radiology. It also provides researchers with detailed insight into the 
      current influential papers in this field, the characteristics of those studies, 
      as well as potential future trends in this fast-developing area of radiology.
