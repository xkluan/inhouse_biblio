AB  - Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to diagnostic, 
      therapeutic, and intervention-based applications in the field of medicine. Today, 
      there is a deep chasm between AI-based research articles and their translation to 
      clinical anesthesia, which needs to be addressed. Machine learning (ML), the most 
      widely applied arm of AI in medicine, confers the ability to analyze large 
      volumes of data, find associations, and predict outcomes with ongoing learning by 
      the computer. It involves algorithm creation, testing and analyses with the 
      ability to perform cognitive functions including association between variables, 
      pattern recognition, and prediction of outcomes. AI-supported closed loops have 
      been designed for pharmacological maintenance of anesthesia and hemodynamic 
      management. Mechanical robots can perform dexterity and skill-based tasks such as 
      intubation and regional blocks with precision, whereas clinical-decision support 
      systems in crisis situations may augment the role of the clinician. The 
      possibilities are boundless, yet widespread adoption of AI is still far from the 
      ground reality. Patient-related "Big Data" collection, validation, transfer, and 
      testing are under ethical scrutiny. For this narrative review, we conducted a 
      PubMed search in 2020-21 and retrieved articles related to AI and anesthesia. 
      After careful consideration of the content, we prepared the review to highlight 
      the growing importance of AI in anesthesia. Awareness and understanding of the 
      basics of AI are the first steps to be undertaken by clinicians. In this 
      narrative review, we have discussed salient features of ongoing AI research 
      related to anesthesia and perioperative care.
